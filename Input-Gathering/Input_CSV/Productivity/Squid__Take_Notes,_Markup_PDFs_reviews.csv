"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Until you pay money, you cannot use even a good template or a smart feature in free version because almost all things can be used in premium version. I already tested so many digital notes taking apps, and this app is one of the worst apps!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The writing is smooth and satisfying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For a while I neglected my studying and but recently I found this app and I'm currently using it with my new stylus and it works amazing writes better than if I were writing on paper for once I'm not neglecting my studies no more I'm studying again thank you guys"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great lightweight app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. I would buy if it was one time purchase but subscription is a no go for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Been stagnant for several years. Needs more basic features like bookmarks and bookmark navigation and swipe to turn page. The inking is still great imo, but the lack of other features makes it hard to recommend this program anymore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app is subscription slop. I would have been happy with paying one time for the app, but no. You have to have paid subscription to use it. Definitely skip this one, don't let these developers get away with abusive pricing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite note taking app. Have been a user for several years"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Yearly subscription is not good in Android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Note Taking App out there. I use it with my table for documentation of inspections (on the go) and also for protocoling meetings. It just completely replaces the need for paper. Additional features like inserting image etc. are just great. Currently, it just defines my work a d could not go without it. Only missing feature but currently no real need (nice to have): synchronization of multiple devices or access over pc/browser."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I frequently used it for art since grade 2 and I STILL had my drawings on Google photos"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Responsive app and has all the features I expect from a note taking app on a tablet, but the paywalls are a dealbreaker for me. No PDF import in the free version..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Why do you not allow customisation of the task bar? It's stupid that I cannot just add eraser to the top, instead of having to click a button and then select eraser, just do the same to get back to the pen... This would be much easier if you put them all separately at the top Also, it would be good if I could add subfolders in each folder to organise notes..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Basic app. Works smoothly with pen but lacks major features. It would be an ultimate app if they provide Auto-Shape features. It's cumbersome to select shapes everytime."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, love doodling and writing in it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No text insertation for free version. This should be mentioned in the description"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"5 stars. But please add bookmarks functionality on imported pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app for PDF markups on site visits and for information on plan changes that get sent to my team."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No fullscreen mode I can't choose words in pdfs i can only write over them I can't scroll the pages down instead i have to push a button every time i wanna change the page Bad design It is mostly bad but it is cheap and i can see why"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I hate it and like it‚it took away all my data."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"thes in not creat for kurd"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a life-saver. I really like the infinite note taking system. One thing that I would like to have a search option to find notes with specific titles. A favorites option would be the cherry on top"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why are basic tools something I have to buy? This app didn't even get me through the test phase when I saw that... There are way too many alternatives to not just provide utterly basic functions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app! Thanks to it, my desk is much cleaner since I don’t need piles of paper anymore. I also use the app instead of a clipboard when I’m on the go, which has made my workflow smoother and more organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for quick notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this App. I love it, I love it, I love it because it is a nice, good, lovely and Darling App. I wish I had a girl friend like this App. Thanks a million to its developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly pleased!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be amazing if it had a ruler"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Subscription service. £3/month or £15/year"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app! It's great for school on my tablet with a stylus. There are a couple things I wish it had off the top of my head though. I with it could identify what I wrote with my stylus and translate that to text. Also, if it can do that I'd also like it to be able to make what I write searchable like searching a normal PDF. The file system was a much needed upgrade and is very appreciated. Again I absolutely love this app even without those features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm loving it so far it has made taking notes Soo much easier Now I want to upgrade n be able to use all that it can possibly offer ❤️"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! Use it when I need to ""write "" down measurements."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"ghost t0uch issue within chrome os, the stylus stops working suddenly until i restart tablet, its probably because the app/ android subsystem registers a finger touch that persists, id be so grateful if you add an option for stylus only input / no touch gestures on controls while using the app, its really annoying when im trying to study or write long paragraphs, note that this issue only happens within android apps, chrome os apps work perfectly with stylus and palm rejection"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing! Simple yet very useful for studying and making quick notes. I don't have the premium version, but it still works effectively as I tend to study on my device from time to time. I truly recommend if you want something simple and fast to use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been using Squid for years and have been pleased overall with it! It's been great for both academic and professional uses. One feature I hope to see is the ability to organize individual notes. I consistently work on very long PDF files that themselves have chapters and I wish I could break up the note into 'chapters' for easier navigation. I love it though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very Nice App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic for reading and editing pdfs, and lets me export a page as an image file too."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use, like a digital whiteboard. I love the different 'paper' rulings because they help me effectively do my job. I didn't know what to expect from it, but in the end, imglad I downloaded it. Highly recommend A++"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good 😄😄😄😁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"so I can't use my s pen but you promote as note taking app can't use spen except to write ...can't erases unless I buy tools separately can't change the page easily with fingers no change of colors then why the hell did you sell the pdf editor well done I could just have used other free pdf editors insead of wasting money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"everything is working great. One suggestion is to add dark pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An exceptional experience highly appreciated due to it's free of cost facility.a suggestion to add the highlighter feature out of the premium package. Highly recommendable 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"OMG! I can CREATE, using keyboard or my own chicken scratch, my stories. Best investment ever for a creative writer, though I am sure that Robin Cook, John Grisham, and Val McDermid use something upscale."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The main reason I don't like this app is because it takes two taps to switch to eraser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great writing app! I wish there was a left-hand option (I keep closing the window whenever I rest my hand at the top left corner). Also recording (screen and mic) would be a one stop shop for making video lessons. But over ALL the writing is super smooth and learning curve near zero. Awesome! Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"понос, ничего бесплатного нет. не качайте."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best easy export with extension, accept very large high resolution pic with clear zoom even with low budget phones, add mutiple page to view and edit, organize folder, perfect tool with mini size the best pdf viewer and editor thank u great job hope to keep it for many years as its 😘"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You are mad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for me who loves to write down all my notes manually to study. I love being able to personalize the inputs like deciding what happens if I double tap or hold my pen buttons"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very great app, very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy. Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Joke. This app doesn't provide basic function such as writing on keyboard.. Yes it does have but it is in premium offer. I don't mind pay for such elementary tool."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I wouldn't mind if they charged for the software but a freaking ""subscription""? No thanks, I like to own my software, specially something whose main job is to take notes for god sake.. This subscription system as gone too far, and its up to us consumers, not to accept it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid offers the essential tools for taking handwritten notes and annotating PDFs. I find it very comfortable to use and very stable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app to use with the Samsung Galaxy pen. I only have the free version but still enough features for me to make use of it. I like using it for doodling and for when I want to scribble down ideas, as opposed to typing them out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Fine mid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"look great but I don't understand why you need too pay to have txt options when many other have it for free the pen parts was felling perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really useful app. I use it for all my studies and it really helps make studying more active and deepens my understanding when I highlight or make notes on my manuals. I also use it to store other docs I've written and need to refer to. Some functions are a little clunky to use but overall it's a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good simple I suggest view only should have a seperate button on menu bar that we can easily switch on off to scroll with one finger"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I rcvd a message that the app update did not get installed correctly and i shd backup the data and reinstall. However the backup is not working.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quite enjoy the PDF markup abilities! It would be great to fully support the OnePlus Pad 2 Stylus (haptic feedback & switching pen modes). In some PDF imports I do see strange text boxes around PDF text? And I'd love to have a one-time payment to add cloud backup. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app with Galaxy Note A2016. Its works perfectly. Best than the other stylus-app. Page could be expand very large, page background can be set colourfull, so many templates. And the best one I liked, it's all free..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Muito bom pra anotações escolares e fazer resumos de matérias. O preço de R$ 40,00 ao ano não é tão alto, mas a versão grátis é bem capada"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Даже в бесплатном виде отличная штука"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why this app is not getting updated? Pls bring in the laser pointer"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good very good"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Edit2: Thanks for replying, now I found how to purchase ""tool pack"" and ""pdf import"". The premium backgrounds are not purchasable though, which is what I was looking for and my previous complaint was about. I added more stars. Edit1: I re-installed it, tried your suggestion in your reply to my review (it's a shame it disappeared, when I edited my review) . THERE IS NO ""YOU JUST WANT"" LINK to purchase features separately. IT ONLY ALLOWS SUBSCRIBING, which is what I complained about."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works super nice with a stylus; tho I think the weight could be a little more sensitive so the writing would look even nicer, but it's already very good. Wish it had the option to make the paper black or even better change its color. I use it for math, so I use the grid. I would be perfect if I could have black paper with white grid for example, please add this feature it's awful to use white all the time. Also, why is the select tool and eraser not always visible? Have to click the pen first"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for filling out my pdf reports. A tool I rely on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Squid version 5.0.28 gp updated 31st August 2024: ABSOLUTE TRASH...no such improvent of adding new features.. No zoom box, palm rejection, ocr image,math box, audio, search words option No grid spectrum option,can't detect website in text boxes, no table of contents , bookmarked ink options, no ink to shape, no continuous vertical scroll Cant open notes side by side, no pdf page orientation option SCAMMER DEVELOPERS...throw your WORTHLESS APP TO A TRASH YOU IDIOT.. SHAME ON YOU GUYS!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I need it to be. I love it. Best app I've bought for this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful jotting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs to be better...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Wanted this app to be great. I really did. I have the upgraded version. It's my main note app. And I'm consistently frustrated and confused by it. If you like dark modes, then good luck to you. And if you want to copy and paste some text sometimes... Hope and pray. This app isn't the worst It definitely gets worse. But it's still dismal and will leave you feeling uncertain if you have captured what you wanted and trying over and over again, hoping that maybe it will make sense."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app In the world Download The app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Precisely useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Stupid adds"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app in the market for taking notes with S Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why can we set colour only with blank background, with any other background there's no option to set colour. Other than that the app has many great features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"1. There is no concept of cover page here. 2. Some page templates like cursive writing english, bordered pages etc should be there. 3. An option to add custom template will be best. 4. Please make changing colour of pens little easy as we have to do it very often. 5. Erase objects partially is kept premium which is a little too greedy. Otherwise this app is better than even GoodNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really nice I use the free version and it works really well w/ my tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, straightforward it could easily be the best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing and powerful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"That's the most useless app everything is premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"many waste space going on above the board during recording video using this board , many tools are not avilable,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredible app. Use it all the time. Top marks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a decent app overall for handwritten notes. But it doesn't support subscript or superscript text yet, which is absolutely useful for science students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Subscribe is garbage. I want to buy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For the most part, I love using this app. I'd love to change/fix: I use Squid primarily for taking down rough music notes using the template staff paper. It's mad that the staves don't fit the pages properly eg 11½ staves in A4. The ability to choose how many staves on a page (within a sensible range eg 8-12) would be brilliant. 11 staves with space at the top for a header would be far more useful than the current."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Convenient in so many ways!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using Squid to write down my thoughts or if I want to vent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I greatly enjoy using this application, so easy and user friendly. I kindly submit that if you may be able to add some different fonts for text input, as well as bold and italics"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app gets one star because it is greedy to ask for subscription for software like this. This is never going to change so much that you need to collect $3 a month for me in order to use it. There are many replacements they're quite a few ways I can accomplish all of the same things I can do for absolutely free with other apps. Stop being so darn greedy and just come up with a price for your app instead of trying to milk your customers forever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great stuff been uaing for years. Plwase compile to other OSs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Cmon.... so much lag. Whenever my palm (not finger) touches the screen, it thinks I'm erasing and freezes the whole screen. When I try to go disable any inputs by my finger to stop messing with my pen, the whole app freezes before I can save my settings. The eraser binded to my fingers also disables my ability to zoom and pan, making me have to clsoe and open the app again. Backup to google drive also rarely works, I've lost hours upon hours of notes. Unacceptable to a paying consumer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite app for marking on pdfs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb,💜💜💜💜💜"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it.It helps me in arranging my notes and also u can create ur own notes from various sources and combine them into a single page in the squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lovely app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Monthly and annual subscriptions. nOtE tAkInG aS a SeRviCe. You will own nothing and you will be happy. Update: OOOOOHH DUUUH, Apparently you're allowed to do one-time purchases of features but YOU don't decide when this becomes available. You cannot access an area in the app to choose these one-time purchases. You need to wait around for the prompt that may eventually come and then you can buy features on a one time basis rather than $3 a month (maybe)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"app looks great. lots of cool options. seems to be a great app. how ever I'll never know because i have a rule that the app must prove it's worth$ before buying. this app dose not allow free text (typing) only hand written. my writing is sloppy more so on phone. no text...? deal breaker. sry"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"And it looks great. Love it. Thx! Edit: often flings me across the canvas and then I have to zoom out to find where my work went and then zoom back into that. Happens every few minutes. Very annoying. Samsung Galaxy Chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bring back infinite canvas. It's only infinite to right and down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Edit: HUGE FLAW! All my work is gone! It auto updated, and then failed. Since it saves stuff in the ap instead of my gallary, I can't access ANY of my designs! The ap says it will backup my work and then re-download, but instead it just closes the ap without saving anything! I liked this ap before it wrecked everything, but since you can't save your own work, this ap is very risky!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works pretty well. I am able to do everything I need for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is THE app for note taking. If you're old enough to remember having to learn hand writing or penmanship in elementary school and you enjoy hand writing your notes for school, work, journaling, or even some mathematics, then I would strongly recommend this app and it's very affordable premium version. My USI stylus works flawlessly on my convertible HP Chromebook Plus. Just make sure your 2 in 1 laptop can use USI 1 or USI 2 stylus pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a good application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the app a lot. Not the biggest fan of some basic tools being behind a paywall but it's doable. My major gripe is no sync between devices... yes there's a cloud backup option but having to manually backup every time I use a different devices is starting to get annoying. Might migrate to another app with more convenience in that regard."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Bonjour, je viens de reprendre la version payante depuis qu'il y a enfin la gestion des dossiers. Il manque une option de recherche par nom, et peut être le classement des notes par date. Bien sûr une version synchronisée sur Windows serait un plus, comme Goodnotes..."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"i didn't even allow the app to access my files, no notification came and when I chose to open a file it suddenly imports it without asking. it didn't even ask at the first time. why is that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"really? just ONE type of pencil?"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It doesn't lag for my tablet like the others do, but what i do not like is that it doesn't have the text tool which i was hoping to see for FREE😤. I can't use this freely because it doesn't have a text tool, but overall it's ok😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this but ads i cant bear it"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"First was quite fine but I don't know what changed and now whenever I write it looks like pixelated. I cannot use the app after this problem. And since there's no update, it doesn't get fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app for the Fold 5. Would be great if there was a way of locking position of images and groups of scribbles."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"basic, there are better apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I thought there is no premium but turn out I need to subcribe just to import a PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best app to work with S Pen while in class or in business. This is a must have app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Incredibly expensive for something that can be done for free on any android phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice, my suggestion is the moment I paste a selection over the page,that sticked permanently. It should be free to move again when user desire."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"there's no option to erase a particular thing on the page than to undo everything in sequence. that's disappointing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like everything about this app except for the scrolling function on pdfs. It would be much better if could scroll by swiping instead of tapping that very unergonomic page change button. Please solve this problem so that I can scroll faster while I'm studying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is just good and perfect for my notes it was good and smooth on my broken tempered glass tablet. But I wish some of the features will be free. Because I'm broke but I wish that I was rich too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This was not worth my time. Even tho it was kind of good it can never be 5 stars. Not even 4. I hated the way it always shows this weird thing in the screen whenever I moved my notes around. And to import a pdf to the notes u need to get premium???? Like why. It doesn't have any cool features at all. Idk about others but for me this is not at all a good app. If I could I would have rated it 0."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The BEST. Things I didn't know I learned by using Squid ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app functions amazingly most of the time and has been a big help on not using paper as much in uni. the main issue is simply that my active pen will randomly not register and i will need to close my note and reopen it to get it to work again. if this issue is fixed the app will be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"... subscription paid for upload pdf an mark pdf ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app! doing many of my writing practices in it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, but would be nice if you could show multiple notes at once or search through notes. As others mentioned the app sometimes freezes then you have to touch with 2 fingers to get it to unfreeze. Also an auto backup for notes whenever they are edited would be great (maybe even allow us to set backup interval to every 10 minutes up until the current maximum), along with maybe storing undo history with the notes when they are backed up to the cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"useless+ paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy user interface. It's pretty basic but that's what I was looking for. I do wish it was easier to share my notes across all devices, like Google keep. Otherwise it's great though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unforgivable!!!! I just finished the payment in order to purchase squid premium. The money has been debited from my account, however, it was not reflected on the app. There was not even a contact number so that I could speak about this issue with someone. You simply just can't play with someone's money like this. Very disappointed with the service. Now I'm really upset that I've wasted my money and my time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You can only markup pdfs if you pay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Since recent UPDATE cannpt back up amd crashes. Now unfortunatley useless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I didnt quite like the fact that you had to pay £6.99 just to type and get to use tool kits . My overall rating is that it is also good quality but could do with some working ! Overall , I do recommend it to people whom need notes . 4 /5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"every other click is a micro transaction. can't use all the described features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"missing 1 star because I'd like to see: 1. image/selection rotation 2. more robust text input (changing font size after its inserted, different font styles, etc)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even select a different pen without it forcing me to pay for it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"overall it's good and smooth for writing,drawing or multitasking even not using an expensive stylus pen. Good job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I don't why everyone one given the less star. I want just to say the one update i needed is that i always not wanted to use pen ...some time we open just to read it....so please add the read only feature also.🙆🏼‍♂️ srry feature hai ye already 😂...my bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great simple handwritten note taking app but not having the ability to search through your handwritten notes is a complete let down. So many other apps already have this already and it's disappointing that Squid doesn't. People have been asking for this for years on the feedback site but it seems like they have no plans to add it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"1 Star that app is trash don't download it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing APP for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"At one time, you can view only one page of your notes. Continuous scrolling page by page is not possible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"meets all my expectations, really useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but the interface looks very old, not modern, the blue bar takes a big space of the screen And a very annoying thing is that I can't reach the eraser in one move You should put the eraser directly in the blue bar so I can switch between the pen and the eraser easily Please take this review into consideration in the next update .. Thx"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent Application Easy edit to any PDF, can open any PDF and it gets saved automatically, MUST TRY AND ENJOY."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"bad need to pay for better stuff"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its an amazing app....but I think it woukd even be better if it had more options for the pen, and not just one and the highlighter, plus the option to edit an imagine, like being able to remove it or change its location later. And you cant partially erase a part that you highlighted..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app for android by FAR, I use it for all of my school work (which is 100s of notes worth) The only problem I have is that every now and then it has a glitch where it becomes uncalibrated, but this is easily fixed by exiting and re-entering the note"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app would have been everything that I need, except it does not support clickable links in pdfs. I don't know why this feature hasn't been implemented yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love the app for taking notes, but the last update has the zooming completely messed up. Half the time I try to zoom in or move around it sends me to the opposite corner of the page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Simple but pdf should premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works great on tablet. great for note taking and brain storming"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"amazing,it's is exactly what I was looking for 😀 you can use your tablet pen to write in this app technicaly it is the only app which allows you to write with a pen ( like there are other apps but this is the best , trust me ) hoping that my comment is useful 😁"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I can do so many things on this app like an universal work agenda notebook, study tool all in one thing including pdf editing is the best . .etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App used to be great. Could have used some more general drawing features (shapes, object rotation, not covering the screen with the keyboard, etc) but app is now unusable. Crashes immediately on opening. Worked fine before new updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful. It's useful for writing onto PDF documents without having to use a printer... and that is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"UPDATE CORRUPTED YEARS OF WORK--CAN'T ACCESS ANYTHING AND NONE OF THE BACKUPS SAVED 10.18.19: Now it's deleting words as you write them so having to write things several times to take. Resetting app & device do not help. Still want a true eraser for the highlighter. Great for writing in bed if you write better using pencil but need to type it up later. Add-ons were 100% worth it before requiring a subscription. Love the page additions for anywhere in doc, miss being able to say before or after."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is just so amazing, an creative person can make a really good use of it although there are some more improvement needed in terms of stylus or pen use. Otherwise it's an addicting app and fun note making app i also started to write my daily Journals in this app. I am also going to try the latest update version of this app and then review"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good at all metrics"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I had to disinstall it. I just bought a Samsung Galaxy tablet S9 Ultra and this was one of the proposed apps for great productivity.. but anything you write can only be saved as png or jpeg (or pdf?)? No editable files? Useless for me, I use my notes to create documents, they themselves are not the point but what I can do with them. With squd.. nothing. I will wait for something more useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for all your important notes. The only issue I have is that even after locking the page, the page still moves while writing. If they fix this, it'll be the BEST note keeping app out there!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not as good as Samsung Notes. It would be absolutely lovely but you reach the end and can only export to pdf or png' or jpg?1 Not at all useful ! I need to share to an editable file! I will keep it and reconsider if they add this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app overall but shapes need the ability to choose a fill color. For example if you make a square there is only the option to choose a line color. Also more shapes should be added like stars, and other polygons."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great on my OnePlus Tab. Almost perfect even. I use this for work and personal, and it's a great all rounder. Squid 10 is a welcome upgrade, with premium features being just £10 p/year. Some suggestions that would go down really well: 1. being able to format text other than size and colour (e.g. change font and style). 2. Be able to rotate the items (e.g. images, text, or whatever you've selected). 3. Be able to sync notes across multiple devices. Hope to see these in the future"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note making"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love how easy ist to delete Something just written. Would be great to be able to select some block and move it around."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"One of the simplest, elegant note taking apps. I find it natural to think in it. However, it lacks a very intuitive thing which making folders to organize your notes. This is the only reason I use other apps to compensate for this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"cant edit pdf unless you pay money. trash app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Have always liked using this app. Sometimes, I make memes with it, but mostly for work projects, or as a list maker and tracker, it has been almost invaluable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Good app, , except for tracking and upselling attempts. I use another app to tell me when an app is tracking my use and sending information about me to a third party. Squid is the single worst offender on my phone in this regard. This morning it sent 462 trackers! There is no way to opt out. Also, the app is always trying to upsell me on extra paper styles I don't want. That is why I don't recommend this app anymore, and why I am looking for an alternative."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app since 2021 for my studies and all a I have to say is: This app is really amazing, although need to add some functionalities like more varieties of pens."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Sadly, the app, doesn't connect right with my pen (after two weeks) so that I am now writing angular. I wrote an email but nothing happens an my writings look like wrote down by a child. Very sad, because until that I liked the app very much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Genial"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like Squid on Chrome tablet. My only wish list is the ability to manipulate pasted images (they seem to be flattened after I pasted them and performed the next markup). I also wish there is a version for Windows so I can work across chrome and windows platforms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A mixed feeling... I love the practicality & functionality of the app so much but it drains battery on my Samsung Tab S8 Ultra crazy nuts! It's very inconvenient for me to always have to put the app in deep sleep mode when not in use to save battery. Dev, I hope to able to cont'd using this marvellous app u've created with peace of mind... can u kindly rectify the prompted issue for me ASAP? Looking forward to ur reply soon! Thanks."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Something has broke. I have used squid for 6 months and since the first part of October, all of my new handwriting has turned into a jagged mess, almost as though it is trying to hit specific pixels. All old notes look fine, but anything new has this issue. There is no smoothing. Note has changed on my setup. Lenovo M10+ with Lenovo Precision Pen 2. ***Issue resolved as of 10.23.2023. Thank you.*** **Issue returned as of 11.3.2023** ***11.14.2023*** Rating changed to 1 star.** The app is broken."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow it is fantastic app. I real enjoyed with this app. There is no need of note book, exercise book or paper. It is wastage of resource to use other materials after this app is introduced. I really thank you, the developers.👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"There is no scrolling option, or if there is one it's well hidden. I won't be able to use this app as I wanted, to take handwritten notes."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good notes app. Has customizable stylus configurations, useful backup options (new Drive backup is a game-changer) and a pretty intuitive interface. Actual note-taking tools are fairly minimalistic compared to something like Goodnotes for IOS or OneNote (I would kill to have the Goodnotes line-straightening tool in Squid) but what is there works very well. Also nice to have different paper backgrounds available and customizable drag/double-tap actions."

This app is so organized and beautiful and I would highly recommend! The premium price is super reasonable and I am OBSESSED with this app. You can take notes, make lists, build a planner, write a song, plan sports plays, or do a bullet journal. This is the greatest app I've ever encountered in my LIFE. 1000000% recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would want a feature that will allow me to duplicate a page and send it to another note. Also to separate the highlighter as it's own tool, instead of having to go to pen then swapping to highlighter."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If only they could add the merge feature also it'll be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I use it for work and my personal life!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Gosto do app. Uma sugestão não sei se tem isso na versão paga, porém seria interessante ter como fazer páginas ficarem no modo view, não todas mas as que escolhermos, para quando precisar ler ela, não correr risco de apagar.(as vezes to escrevendo algo na pagina 15, preciso ver algo na pagina 2 e corro risco de apagar algo quenão quero)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"INDISPENSIBLE. l use this app virtually everyday, it's endlessly useful. The only thing I'd ask the developer for are more accessibility to the art tools rather than clicking through the pen icon everytime I need to change, a greater range of brush tools and that the canvas could expand in all directions not merely to the bottom right. A top piece of software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great note app with a lot of useful features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Crashing When I use it with pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Wrost aap i ever seen this is wrost app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I don't have the money to buy the ability to use text. I saw the reply, and thank you, but I found a different app. Actually remembering it, I was annoyed because of the text thing but it makes sense. It was the there wasn't a free normal eraser on top of the text thing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"mkae everything free, other than that w app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it, very useful even without a paid plan I love using it as my math notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"V easy to use. Paper is a thing of the past !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"even without premium services, this app has a lot to offer!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would be better if they had full screen mode! It's been years of people asking for it! Edit: voted for full screen, 370 votes and its been up since 2017. Surely you can add an option to maximize the writing space! Update. After having the app for two years I'm moving on. I don't understand why there is a subscription when I have not seen any substantial updates in that time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am sure for some this does the job, but I had trouble getting things to work even while going through the tutorial. Maybe with a lot of practice I could get the basics to work, but I need something that fits me right out of the box."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy to use this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app for annotating big (A0 format...) PDFs. Export works fine (vector format). Just make the thickness and colour of pens easier accessible, for quick work with different colour-thickness pens. Would be awesome. Then, with automatic shape recognition you beat every android competitor and you'll get the earned 5 stars every time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for the spen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for quick notes and editing pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Poderia ter criação de pastas e melhorar o touch da precision pen 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"imagine paying to just type"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app I've used. I teach math and this allows me to easily import pdfs, edit them and export. Love it, highly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm marking 3 stars, because I'm coming up for renewal and I can't justify spending another year paying for this app. The only redeeming quality is the way my writing looks on this app compared to the other note app i use. The reason i prefer the other app to this one, is it has palm rejection and importing. This is a 12 year old app, and you have neither of those essential things. Bring these much needed, frequently asked for features to the app, and I'll gladly return."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has everything you need for study notes and keeping them organised"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is super easy to use and also very intuitively powerful for note taking. Since downloading it it has allowed me to centralize and digitize my note taking on a number of fronts. It is a basic note taking app so don't expect anything fancy but it does what it does very well and very cleanly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it as my main writing app with my stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"EXPENSIVE"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"allows import of pdf of what size??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool! Very easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is good app and still have a lot of room to improvement. Such as pen stabilizer, so user can write more softly when they used low middle device. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. But can be improved alot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its probably the best notes app out there. Especially if you have a good stylus. Adding images is the best feature. Helping a lot for my entrance exam preparation. Hoping u guys make an update where u can add gifs. Ik its too much to ask. But i believe in you guys. Keep up the good work!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Freemium Basic pen app without advanced features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app i have ever use , dear owner can you add some new feature like more shapes and other things ..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love it but it syncing between devices is arduous and unreliable. You have to remember which one to restore from that you were on last etc. It's a shame the app doesn't sync changes on its own.. lost work, and decided to uninstall as I don't have time to be trying to figure it out any more. Also not having continuous pages is not ideal. The writer ng feature is great though and if you don't have different projects and different devices you regularly switch between it would probably be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is w what I was trying to find for years , easy to use, take notes that you can add pages , pen drawings, text etc. Also you can export your notes with pages as pdf etc. And it comes with many pages formats to choose This is a must app for students at the people who wants to leave paper textbooks behind!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've had a good experience thus far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I am unable to purchase the premium version. I am in awe of this app, it's just so smooth and easy to use. When I try to upgrade, it shows an error. I would love for this problem to be solved."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste of time app don't try"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app overall. Its pdf use is super intuitive and convenient. I just wish that you could move imported images or delete them after. It's really annoying having to spam the undo button to remove an image and then redo all the other work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Collects too much data I understand a need to collect the device model and screen density, but: gender, first/second name, GPS coordinates,Postal Code, City? How come Google trackers are allowed in the app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"basically only usable paid and if it's paid just make the app itself paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's a useless app all the templates are premium not even highlighter is not free.Only ruled sheet is free.😡"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application to keep your notes and the premium subscription value for money at just 10€ for one year!! Could just improve on some minor things like to be able to adjust pages order and move different pages to another notes. Otherwise everything works perfect with Lenovo tablet that with smart pen feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Asking for money without giving demo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have been having problems with this service where when I try to take notes my Chromebook screen goes black and freezes. It's unfortunate because I paid for the service and now I can't use it without risking braking my laptop."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"My overall experience has been excellent, but I do have a significant concern regarding the absence of a simple scroll option. It requires the use of two fingers to scroll down, which can be cumbersome. It would greatly improve the user experience if there were a single-scroll option, where I could type a command that would temporarily freeze all notes, allowing me to effortlessly scroll down by holding the screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A lot of creative writing and drawing options! I enjoy the multiple formats for setting up different kinds of notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"twice now it has crashed deleting some of my work having me to rewrite notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very intuitive smart little helper prog. I use it every day for school for 4 semesters already, it has consistently met my needs in every way and it's the cheapest pro version out there (trust me, you need the pro, cutting in pics and pdfs has been a lifesaver with proffs changing out slides last minute). I keep recommending it to anyone who'd listen, made plenty of classmates very happy. UPD: two years later I'm still using it, happy as a clam"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's nice but can we use a stylus pen on it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's an okay app. It would be better if they add option for Plam Rejection or something for devices that don't have that capability. Some other improvements can be made. Given it's a premium paid application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pay wall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Only options to save/sync/store/export is to pdf; dropbox or box. This is not functional for me, I need Drive as an option because that's where all my stuff are. Squid is developing into a nice app, I've tested it over a couple of years. As an Spen/stylus user, Squid comes in second after Snotes/Samsung Notes - I have tested a lot of apps! Keep at it guys, you're doing great!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for my need. It's fast and does the job. After I got to try the Beta version this app have become a lot better! Not yet 100%, but it's close. All my notes are hand written using Squid, no paper for me!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"La mejir app que encontré para tomar apuntes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Need to pay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Couldn't do without it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. The only thing i think is missing is vertical scrolling. I've paid for several features, including pdf editing, but this lack of vertical scrolling for pdfs or multipage documents is a pretty sore spot for me when using the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm really contented with this note taking app. Sure this is the best I've used so far. You can share the note on Google drive in the original squid format. Grad I can use this app on both Android phone and other devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls add a feature like syncing across multiple devices.. overall a good app.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent program , exactly as described"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wanted to transition from paper to electronics note taking for my degree and Squid has made that possible. I enjoy it because I can bring in papers/PowerPoints in and annotate them. I also like that I can select large pieces of my notes and move them to reorder my page. Finally, I am not over whelmed by too many choices in the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Legit best app for Android note taking. Loving it a lot. Best budget friendly. If you are trying to find an app to take notes digitally, trust this app blindly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What a fantastic Application, 5 stars from me as I use this for my business daily, we are now a paperless business using 1 app, only thing that is extremely needed is a title search button we have hundreds of notes and it's getting more and more difficult as days go on, please make this a priority. Still a well deserved 5* but id make it a 6* with the search option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Premium needed for PASTE function"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"On my chrome book it crashed my book. I tried it twice and it still crashed so I had to Uninstaller it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Works for some documents, but others will crash, destroying all the work you have done OR it will just crash when opening the document. There is, as far as i can tell, no way to fix this. When it does work, it is quite nice with the exception of the fact that you skin is the eraser. This means that, as you write, you may erase something else if your hand is touching the pad. Anyways, the former is the more frustrating and egregious of the issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid to update this app to premium specifically to import .pdf files. It will not do it. I certainly want my money back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This aap's quality is very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add some more features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"We use it for business and it's great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Some more tools will make this app great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"We need a dark theme to be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hi, How can I sign in to other mobile? I cannot find any option. Please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app to write and draw"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Impressive app. One thing, if you're going to download it make sure that you have over-ride force dark DISABLED or it's gonna look like it keeps getting deleted. It would be great if there's an option to go full-screen mode when taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app on android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Would be amazing if they didn't lock completley basic features like a true eraser and text behind a 10$per year paywall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good writing response."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it 😄"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app. I use it everyday at work in the construction field. My only wish is that there was a way to search my notes since I have a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry, no. A notebook is not something you subscribe to. Sell me an app? Sure. A subscription? No thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pdf import is a paid feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Es incómodo pasar de lápiz a borrador, dos toques, es mejor un toque"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is my first note-taking app, and I enjoy its simplicity in form and its more than adequate functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"More brushes for drawing maybe? I used it to markup on pdf, it works like a charm!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using it with my note 9 for a couple of months now. It's made taking survey notes in the field much more neat and organized. I'm using the app with note 23 now. Still is a great pdf app for your phone. I tried adobe 7 day free trial, even if it was going to cost 99 per year. I really love adobe dc on my pC. But it was just to hard to learn the mobile version. Of and squid cost pennies compared to adobe."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app !!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app and cheap for who really need those tools (1€/month) but I'd perfect the addition of notebooks to become more organized, that's why I give 4 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Everything paid for pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only complaint is the inability to open side by side. E.g open pdf and note side by side. The work around is cumbersome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Easy to use. The best handwriting app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the PERFECT note-taking app for me. I've tried a ton of different ones and they all just seemed overly complicated or didn't have the features I wanted but Squid is exactly what i needed! I use it for school notes, work, and just general hobbies and personal notes, i think I've used it every day since i downloaded it. Love the infinite pages and all the customization options, and it's really simple and straight-forward to use! Premium is def worth it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is AMAZING. I love it. I've shared it with someone else. The premium is $10 a year, which I believe is worth it. I use it for multiple purposes, such as for my studies and to keep me and my toddler on schedule. I don't have any complaints and I've used Squid for a while now. I wish this wasn't on a cloud, or an option to not put something on it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"actually I love it, but It should added a ""search"" file function, its is very difficult to find note/file that I'm looking for, please add search function and I will give 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using and relying on this app for 5 years of university and 2 years of working. Better and more organized than paper for notes. Great for PDF markup (paid feature) and diagrams. Can't imagine not having this app available to me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is very very good and it it best for teachers who take online classes in mobile.this is also good for students who wants to take digital notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid helped me a lot in my studies....thank you so much ...and special thanks to the app developer....love you guys a lot 💟💟💟"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app, please add black theme."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"بسیار عالی"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great note taking app on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply outstanding ....if you need something like digital notebook this app you should definitely consider"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome App, best i have seen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this, use it every day!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Seems like buttons are backwards off is on, on is off. Does not read all active pens. Erases when it should write and so on. I can not get it to draw a straight line or even make legible writing. It is useless for taking notes if the notes are unreadable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Only problem is not all features are free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy. Everything you need, nothing you don't. I mostly use it to write notes in handwriting. I really like it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is overall pretty awesome and has features that I can't find on other note-taking apps. The biggest drawbacks are 1.) content does not sync between my devices and 2.) there is some sort of glitch that occurs when using the app where it freezes. l just have to touch the screen with 2 fingers to fix it, but when you're doing that every few minutes or so, it's disruptive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Samsung notes is better in detecting the strokes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"User friendly, great application to make/organize your notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a basic note app that didn't have unethical contracts to sell data; I came across Squid. While being a private enough note app, it's not the notes I was looking for. BUT ITS SO GOOD. I've never bothered to use my pen because the experiences always moderately suck, but Squid feels amazing, and it's packed full of free and premium features. I hate that it's a subscription, but they cut the greed out of their for-profit mentality and offer an amazing price. Recommend 110%."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I did it really like it. everythingis for premium. can you at least get one thing without a premium thing Pls ... I can't delete things in this app too, So I am going to uninstall this app sorry..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for visual notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best program. I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As someone with ADHD this app works great. It's easy to use. Easy to keep my notes on tracked. Works love more fun features such as s stickers, new pen types the ability to make note books not just categorize them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's great, but it needs the option of using hyperlinks. Without that, I will probably cancel my subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This is not good app it won't let me highlight it is telling me to do more notes then I will get the highlight but still didn't get the highlight 😠😐😡"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Poor app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Potential to be great but the paywall is ridiculous, even simple tools like adding text has to be purchased. Crazy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"AMAZINGA underrated app. Only thing missing is a search bar to scroll through pdf documents quickly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"keyboard doesnt enter any thing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I have one request, though. I'm using this for mindmaps. The ability to be able to rotate the text you typed in at 360°, would be very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"just not seeing improvements to the app like folder structures. not a complicated ask."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, nearly perfect. would like a canvas lock button that completely locks scrolling and zooming period. often scroll when I don't want to. still purchased it and am happy. Great job !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I never tried it... But, I assume, it's alright.🤔"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even paste text without upgrading. Disappointing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is nice Pad for Scribb ling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app and it works fantastically with my S Pen on my S22 Ultra, unfortunately I didn't see an option to take notes in landscape format? Other than I highly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Full screen mode is not available"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such a relief! Has nearly all the features I was looking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"رائع"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, use daily for work. The only flaw is that it sends 2 emails when I export directly to email for some reason. Could be improved with more tools for drawing i.e. dotted line and free hand shape detection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good but need improvement. Developers to be a bit more creative in terms of interface. This app has good potential. Best of luck."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Serves the purpose incredibly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice,but Nah"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a stylus phone and needed a note taking app that I could quickly jot down a note and this fit the bill. All the other note apps forced me to type but I needed something that worked with my stylus pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it is my favourite thing in the entire world! I do everything on here now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great experience😀😀"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"P Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is the best note taking app I've used on android so far, but it's far from as good as it could and should be. The important thing is that it works reliably and easily on my Tab s6. But it really needs more and deeper features. Layers, shape tools, better image editing/manipulation (proper rotation etc), brush editing, custom backgrounds, and many more sorely missed features. Things that other apps do better but none do reliably. This app could be so good but for now it's merely the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good at most things you want to do, but would be good to be able to draw the shapes at an angle."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not available in Ukranian and no possibility to help to translate to Ukranian."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There no text option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I wont give 5 stars and buy premium unless you give option of continuous vertical scrolling for finite size pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"EDIT: Cloud Backup and many of the note Backgrounds are subscription only. Very few features available for outright purchase. ORIG: Subscription only. No outright purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use after you get the hang of the software, helps me run my small business."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"no fill tool cant doodl in clas bad would rathr use pencil whic defeat purpos bobo broke it trust"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall, a very useful tool. Having some issues reading text in exported PDF files; likely due to some format version convention disagreements between Squid and my Mac. Everthing else so far has been excellent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for drawing out thoughts"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately ur app issues are not my problem to solve. With all due respect. I Paid for a service I cannot access. How will we remedy? I want the service if we can get it worked out like today. .."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is really great app but if the text bar wasn't pro(doesn't ask money) it would have been cooler."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it. I've got Samsung pen, but I love my Squid!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall great app. Even better if you have the option to create an account so if you ever lost your device all you have to do is sign in and your notes will be there. My device recently reset itself for some reason and i lost all my notes (I'm at the end of my second year of uni and it's like I never went at all). Exams are coming up and I can't revise because all my notes are gone. Would have given a five star but I'm just pissed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Should have more features like a ruler"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best ever app specially for note devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow very nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the most intuitive tablet notetaking app I've used; I ttried several others and this one was the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This is a horible app everything I needed was premium I just hate it! DONT DOWNLOAD!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No doubt this is the best app but one feature should have to add in this app that is full screen working which makes more attractive if this features is added I will upgrade premium. thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You're gonna look me in the eyes and tell me THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE HIGHLIGHTER TOOL!?!!?!?? That's just downright diabolical man."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It locks adding text, behind a paywall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App, The UI is the cleanest and very intuitive, i also love the finger erase feature. I have two problems, 1) It doesn't support Xiaomi smart pen so i can't use the buttons, 2) The Lines Wobble A LOT only in this app other apps work just fine"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app please add dark mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why so few menu icons? To access any other tool like eraser, lasso, shapes, highlighter, you have to first open the tool icon. So every time you want to change tools it's at least two taps and searching, instead of one tap. Each of these tools should have an always visible icon. Classic example of a UI that's been way too oversimplified: friction: slow. Like: pen button as lasso, finger as eraser. And can customize those. Let user customize the icon area, would be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. However there seems to be this problem where it will delete random letters from written words when you go back to look at it later"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Quick question, is there a feature that allows you to choose your writing input? So the app picks up your (passive) stylus and not your hand? Thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love this app. It helps with taking note and I love the options on what papers you can choose from. But one thing I didn't really like is that some of the other papers you have to pay for it... but of course you still have some papers that are helpful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"amazing notes app, i use it on my quite outdated samsung tablet and this app still works perfectly !! premium per month is also affordable :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. But I think search button in pdf files would be really nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"How to sync notes between two devices ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's not bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice experience with it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Went through the tutorial and made a new note. I walked about 2 miles taking notes of work progress on a construction site. I get back out of the sun and half of everything is missing. It looks like someone randomly wiped the eraser tool all over. I don't have time to find out why. APP DELETED"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the most intuitive note taking app I've been able to find, with the same features as ipad competitors, and isn't walled into just Samsung devices like Samsung notes. Only thing I miss from one note is how easy it was to view my notes on other devices. I can view PDFs from my cloud backup, but those are on a backup timer. But it's a lot less glitchy than one note which makes it pretty worth?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Best note taking app for SAMSUNG GALAXY TAB A, sadly it is still very slow when opening and editing PDFs, I have made the monthly package because I really like it, I would just LOVE IT if you made it a bit quicker for pdfs, thank you. ---- Edit: Stiller a really Good app but since theres no option for pages to scroll vertically I have been using other apps for over a year now (and coming back to see if there's any updates regarding scrolling but nothing as usually which is a shame)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and powerful. Does all the things you'd like to do, and just the way you'd expect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I downloaded and deleted countless note taking apps trying to find exactly what Squid provides. I love the templating capabilities, as well as being able to import/export and mark up .pdfs. I would suggest this app to anyone looking for a solid platform for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Note App IMO"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Add vocabulary training paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"better than the app on my tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I still don't like the subscription they try making it sound like they do the consumer a favor by updating with new paper background lol and also claim they are not nickel and dining us too. We are not idiots. Un-installed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I use it on Chromebook tablet. Wish it had Onedrive integration for backups."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does everything I want it to do. I'm still amazed at my handwriting on a device because it looks like real paper writing, and it exports easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am very pleased with the functionality of this app and so far it is the best choice for notetaking on my Chromebook, however the lack of a left-handed UI setting causes issues related to accidental keypresses and more. Please consider implementation of a left-handed mode for the UI of this app, or alternatively a way to customize where icons are on the UI. Besides this review, I have also suggested this on the official feedback site. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well in my LG V60."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I RATE THIS APP A 2 STARS BECAUSE ITS GLITCHY AND IT DOES NOT DO WHAT I WANT TO DRAW"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paywall. The basic version don't even let to test the app properly, because for beginning to annotate any pdf you need to pay. Have no clue what I'm going to pay for, bot recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app supposedly lets you markup pdfs once you get the premium service. It's an AWESOME idea HOWEVER if you enlarge the page you're working on you CANNOT move the page around because it marks upthe page wherever you scroll. It needs arrow up/down & side to side. OR a simple button to stop writing until the page is moved to the correct position. I used both my Samsung tablet 2019 TAB A & Samsung S23 Ultra to no avail. I've cancelled my subscription. Can't recommend it at this time for pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful. I have used this app for scale drawings using the graph paper background."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app really useful, from taking lecture notes to making a bullet journal to track my sleep, I like this far more than keeping multiple physical notes in journals lying all over the place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lack of live sharing feature makes it on par with applications of the past: great usability on your local device, it would have been a hit in the pre-cloud era. Please add a proper live sharing feature: similar to M$ whiteboard in terms of responsiveness, and I will pay the market price. (or get in touch and I will add the feature myself, pro bono) Otherwise I love the work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works good in free mode; better in paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a handy utility I use to sketch out project plans."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't draw shapes as it does in Notability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. My only complaint is that you have to use the page next or back buttons instead of just scrolling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great value for money. I use it for annotating and reading all my papers. I also use it for digital signing of documents and for creating new pdf documents. Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it more than Notability! Great, highly useful and practical product!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quite useful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Needs synch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent Notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"just wow.. thanks developer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for my school work. However, if you could introduce features of a standard PDF reader, like selecting text from an imported PDF for copying, and also a Find too, that'd be awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the experience!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works for what i need it to do. a rotation tool would be greatly appreciated though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app with lots of worthwhile templates and functionally, however... I'm sick of subscriptions! There's too many subscription-based apps! Just let me drop a one time fee"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not available for Family Share? $10/year should warrant that, no?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything works fine enough, but there are a couple of issues: sometimes ink mode is not detected properly and cloud backup doesn't work fine with premium. First backup was properly created, but now I can't create backups when I need to share across my devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A very handy PDF editor..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"have had zero issues with this app. love it! my only suggestion for developers would be to allow for reorganization of notes so that I can keep ""like"" notes together."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good markup app with quality design and functionality. Definitely best available for Android. Would like to see them at arrows,text boxes with arrows, and the like. Writing to text recognition would be nice as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pleased with what it does but needs a few improvements with the loading of pages and need more font options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Don't need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish it wasn't a mostly pay to use app..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its simply perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. ❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really good app. The lack of the ability to lock notes was the dealbreaker for me. Also, the response that the feature exists is misinformative. I reached out to support and they confirmed its not there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No hyperlinks in PDF imports. No premium trial. $1 I'm not getting back for less than 10 minutes of evaluation. Plus handwriting recognition wasn't great on my device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I loved this note taking app until the latest update. Now I can't even access it and a pop up states the latest update didn't install correctly and i need to backup my files then reinstall. This is unbelievable and so frustrating! Horrible customer experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍👍 I love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Seems to work just fine, but the free version is far too limited in order for me to give a fair review and I'm not interested in paying any amount of money while I'm actively looking for a decent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This could be the best note taking app if only there were more pen options and ink smoothing. Lines get too jagged when I write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Abulhussan"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Writing is easy with squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only note that can be casted to the chromecast with live annotation. Simple to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"shared access to working notes and notebooks rather than just exportable pdfs would be next level (teamwork, projects etc)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No magnifying only stupid pinch and zoom and no dark mode in 2023. Pffffff. Uninstall... I don't get why there is no android app with a magnifying function like premium apps as Notability or Good Notes on iOS. It's so awkward to pinch and zoom the whole time. Still have to buy an iPad for writing on a tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its very good app, i liked it, especially to use infinite amount of page in number and size"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking app, and very affordable. The free option is also cool if you don't want to chooses premium! Thank you Squid for our journey of taking notes together!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app seems like it would be great, but it's missing the one thing I need most...OCR in the handwriting notes, to make them searchable. Ping me if it ever happens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The experience is okay on a tablet, it does what it does, but I do have some quibbles with it. The main thing is that the scrolling experience is just... Not good. The blank space that appears after scrolling is just annoying. I understand that it is probably for enhancing performance but please at least add an option for smooth scrolling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Simple note taking app. But lacks in the finer details. Support is lacking. Development going too slow."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Someone was silly enough to make a note app that doesn't support text notes (only finger drawing or stylus).."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If I could give 10 stars, I would have done. By far the best app to take notes. Thanks a lot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"What a waste of 1 euro. Their premium doesn't even include more than one font style to choose from, let alone any text organising tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Doesn't have shape recognition, and its very counter intuitive. You're better off sticking to the generic android notes app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Missing 1 important thing. This app is a great note-taking app. It works very well with the S Pen. The key missing piece is OCR or conversion from handwriting to text. Add this feature and I'll hop back on board."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"1. Bring back the text box feature to type in. it's difficult to type in tablet when the words are behind the keyboard when typing on the lower page 2. Addition of Individual file upload will be of great help than the complete upload. Takes longer time to upload. And about syncing with 2 devices I found out that renaming 2 devices the same in the app will create a single file which can sync to 2 devices so that won't be an issue. I'm using Lenovo Tab 4 10'' and it's smooth to use in."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You need to pay for use on pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I do like this app for note taking, but it does generate huge files relative to some other programs that I use for my iPad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love u"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great use this app everyday without fail"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app to take notes with various design clutter free UI and also add pages to create single notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been my go-to for uni work, great for importing PDFs and writing on them, and decent detection for finger action vs pen. The pro service is worth it for importing PDFs, but I do not like that this is a subscription service. Would rather pay a larger lump sum than a longer subscription. Wish I could set the pen thickness to be constant no matter the zoom, also some bugs on Chromebook with finger actions not meshing with the pen very well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is my primary teaching/preaching companion. I use it at least twice to teach from every week. It has changed the way I communicate the Word of God. Thank you for making an excellent app with so many great features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Actually this app is cool I dont know why people don't like it anymore?? I wanted to tell you that I want to change the colour of the page if you can add that please let me know because its real cool to have a coloured page of an app! Or something. And I wanna highlight and draw in the app please! And really cool thanks for letting us use and write in the app I real appreciate it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's good but I can't Chang color and you must pay to righ in kru bord"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note-taking app for S Pen users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is an intuitive and practical app. I has been a major improvement in my work flow. Looking forward for future updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So kewl"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It was a great experience and hoping to work longer soon!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Outstanding performance!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a very solid app. The brush tool works well and is even presure sensitive! The oly reason I felt it was not 5 stars is becaause the other tools like a highlighter need an in app purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente, principalmente para quem usa tablet com caneta. Não compro mais cadernos. 😅"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's my life book. I can't replace it with someother."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Useful but lacking options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"While I'm sure the free version is probably good enough for many people, the only reason I tried Squid was because I wanted the ability to fill out my own custom PDF forms. I'm fine with paying a one time fee for the pro version but asking for a monthly fee in perpetuity is total BS. The app resides on my device, not in the cloud, so this just seems silly to me - like renting the keys to your car. I know $1 a month is very little, but it's the principle. No, thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Lost my notes because I didn't pay for cloud service. Didn't realize that was a thing until I had to replace my tablet. I know you have to pay bills, but so do I, and those notes were really important."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful... Extra tools are need to be add with free of cost.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Among the best apps of its kind for my needs. Quick, simple, reliable, intuitive. You can just start taking notes without the BS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for my acer chromebook spin 513. I have an active pen and the palm rejection is great. I use this app for all my electronic notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great. I love that I can pay a flat cost for the features I need instead of needing a subscription. The user interface is intuitive, and pdf generation is snappy on a Samsung s7+. Good job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its the best app i have found for marking up PDF documents. I wish it had automatic cross device sync."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish it was available on windows"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app. But PDFs can only be imported if you have paid. It permits you to share files. But dark background not there for ruled pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great experience. Would be 3 Star if there was a way the app can be synced between multiple devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it's is brilliant but no blending is allowed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the app. It's missing back up for google drive. You can back up to One Drive but there shoul be a option for google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A Good Note taking App."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's white. u tryna blind folx?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Hmm I was looking for an app that would allow me to take handwritten notes and this seemed ideal with lots of capabilities actually taking the notes. But notes are not only locked into squid I can't even share them to my PC and other devices. Windows, Android AND Chrome I'm off back to OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, I use it quite often"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Able to rapidly make a note or jot a memory-jog with stylus, keyboard or fingertip. So handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is interesting for note taking nerds. I love how simple it is in nature. You can have freedom of expression as squid allows you to float amidst alphabets. I love the genuine layout of SQUID."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing functionality for comfortable and adequate subscription price. Would be nice to add rotation for selection tools (ability to tilt the selected region) as well as non-white page color."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's what I have needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This is a very good app for writing notes and exporting to pdf and jpeg. The import pdf function is brilliant. With the export to squidnote function can start working on my phone and finish writing on my tablet. BUT even after purchasing the full package, this app surreptitiously sends off tracking data! DuckDuckGo browser's app tracking service caught it repeatedly phoning home. It's paid-for, yet exposes us to strangers on the Web! Very disappointed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I'm so disappointed because I can't use an essential tool as the writing text or the highlight without paying for it. To sum up, this app is completely useless for me as a student. I was just looking for an app that allows me to take notes with all the essential tools required for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Crashes permanently on Chromebook. Used to be perfect, was so for years, but recently it just randomly closes, the export function is hit-and-miss at best and when trying to print to pdf, half the document is off the page. It's unusable at the moment, which is a pity. If this can be sorted, I will happily give it a 5-star review. Until that, I'm unistalling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's really good, especially for sketching, I hope it's can be cross platform"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Other note taking apps add new tools and functions constantly. I've used Squid for years and I've never seen a single new feature. I've been waiting for the option to rotate shapes and text, create polygons such as hexagons and triangles, automatic shape recognition,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"didn't recognize 'dots' unlike other apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am premium user we need some features as laser pen and gesture pen But Laser pen make as a usable in note writing this features makes note Awesome 👍..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for taking notes. I wish there was a pencil case option where you can save multiple pens and highlighters in specific colors/sizes rather than changing the settings manually each time. It would also be nice to be able to write on the background outside of the page margins when editing a PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works fantastic with my galaxy note and is way better than snote, since your handwriting (in PDFs) is a vector graphic. This app gets better with every update. Love it:-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I Love this program. So versatile. This is all you need to save invoices or important documents. Also so easy to create your own forms with a large selection of templates available."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very well thought out, even the free version is amazing, with no blocked features, just limited templates. I particularly love the attention to detail like the option to ""disable the back button"" because while writing I would always swipe back by accident."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app !!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works well for taking written notes, which is the main reason I downloaded it. It would be much more useful if I could search the pdf's that I import by word and if I could highlight the words and define them as I use the app for reading through school work as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely a fabulous app. I use it in my helicopter repair business, I can work in check lists, tracking charts, charts"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good, I like importing pdf slides from classes and being able to annotate them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Most of the app is good, it would be cool to have more pen options but thats not a priority. The biggest problem is the lack of anti alising making anything I write look jagged compared to every other app (Samsung Notes and Noteshelf por example)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can i back up on google drive?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Accomodate my need of quick note in any occasion. Is it possible to create/request custom template for my personal use?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fun and not boring definitely install it so amazing it saves your drawings!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"after using this app for years and purchasing individual premium features, the most basic function of importing PDFs has been moved behind a paywall, making the app I already payed for unusable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app BUT... it needs to be more stable. On my Surface Duo, when I span the app across both screens the content of my note disappears and undo becomes buggy. Also an iOS version would be great so I can write notes on all of my devices!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app 😄😄😄"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great software works awesome, a simple and effective note taking app. It has all the right features you need, I wish it would be available for Windows. Great job Squid team!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Basic markups for PDFs and creating notes. However, was hoping that there are more tools (different fonts, various pen types, pictures) available to make my notes more interesting looking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Every time I want yo add a picture taken with the camera, I just get a message that says ""Unable to add image""."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works so amazingly for taking my collage notes Plus the year subscription was the best thing I ever bought and it was so cheap literally I couldn't buy 3 notebooks and 3 folders for that cheap I love this app so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍 Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So I just downloaded and subscribed and it looks like a great app. I was wondering if the page numbers at the top could also show how many pages are on the PDF aswell (like 4/9) also if it could have an option to use multiple fingers and a swipe to change pages especially when in SPen mode. One last request would be Google drive cloud backup. Otherwise it's fast responsive has many features and I would recommend this app! Only 4 staring to get in touch with the Devs and will change later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app. Absolutely worth paying the subscription. SAVED MY BUTT IN ANATOMY"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My day to day notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can’t open a PDF to edit without paying them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Only one template has a dark version, the app itself doesn't and you have to pay to import pdfs before i can even see if pdfs can be cast in dark mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I will suggest a great property for this app if we able to draw in view-only mode it will be Great because it will be very good for phone there are no problem for tablet but for phone we need to write in view-only mode this will give as more place for drawing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's amazing But if you give everything free by adding ads like as in other applications then it'll be extraordinary"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is great overall. I use it for drawing mindmaps, taking notes and even as a diary. Nevertheless, I wish there was an option for rotating the canvas or the selected visuals."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a good free notetaking app for android users, however it will be much better if they included some highlighter tools even if its just basic color which can be changed by opacity, pls pls ps. it works on Xiaomi Pad 5 :>"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"sucks 100% dont download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like this app but I need an option of giving shape such as a circle rectangle like that for maths"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have paid for the premium but the access has not come I lost 65 rupees and dint get anything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good note taking app, wish it offered a dark mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a very useful install for taking notes to be honest. Would be nice if you could make like 'chapters' (as in folders) in the seperate notebooks you make since I have to make seperate notebooks for different modules. However, this is just something that can make the app better and premium is an amazing price for me as a student so I actually really like Squid, it gives much more than the price entails!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The more I use this app the more I dislike it. Taking a picture from the app never works; I always have to import. The lack of ability to group has made some of my older notes garbage as text has moved over other written text. If I'm writing via stylus with my hand resting on the tablet the page moves as if I'm sliding it with my fingers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Judt phenomenal........ This app has everything needed in a good note app.... It's simple and cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I love this app, but on my Lenovo tablet it crashes all the time. I use it for school, the only appi use. but man it crashes so much. it sucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"love it, perfect for notes in school instead of printing everything, you can also add your own notes, just wish you could add more than just PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I've tried many note taking apps, but I find Squid most convenient! Areas of improvement (1) Add double swipe to exit app feature to disable accidental exit from app. (2) Add folder option to make notes more organized. (3) Add Google Drive backup option as Drive offers 15GB of free cloud space.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"How unsubcribe because every month i have to pay rm4 even im using this apps?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's one of the best apps for taking notes. But there are a few things that could be added. For example keeping three colors visible so you can quickly switch between them creating more colorful notes. Maybe a gesture when touching the screen with 3 fingers (maybe it appears to choose another tool). And online editing via PC for multiple online editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! I love the variety of templates and the accessibility!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, Easy-to-use, Good for Samsung S Pen -- I really enjoying using this app with my S pen from my S22 ultra. Can change writing line size and can choose any color for writing or drawing. Superb app! 💯"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I just wish there was a way to save differentpen styles. (Ex. different colors and sizes)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use, has the convenience of an actual book/notebook. would recommens the premium subscription too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great paper opions, pen sizes and style. Would like the option of creating basic charts (or just the ability to add a couple of straight lines.) Definitely my favorite note app overall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy ... fast ... I can use English or shorthand"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So far the least expensive note app that allows you to write on pdfs and make notes that I've seen so I gave it a go. But there so much to improve. What bugs me the most is that when drawing, the lines are very jagged to the point that I don't want to use the app. then, if I am reading a pdf and I am panning across the page, the previously hidden portion of the page loads only after I release the finger. Very annoying. Also I don't get why you can't finger swipe to flip page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"💖"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Hi! I actually love the app but there is one thing like a one idea i wanna share with you guys! So basically im a student and i dont have enough money to buy the premuim, i would like to give the developers a new update idea!! If you guys can do it i would be so happy!!! The idea is! Since i really want the keyboard without premuim can you guys make fonts, text colors, sticker etc in the premuim keyboard version! And make an without premuim default keyboard! With no things like fonts and all!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for what it is. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect simple notes on an s22 Ultra. sPen is responsive and accurate. Very easy to use. I truly appreciate a pen writing/drawing app that isn't trying to shove some form of social media down my throat, thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for stylus-based interfaces"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great but with its own quirks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best app to keep everything I need to remember. I've been using Squid for almost a year, it has everything I need for my daily tasks and anything else. There's no other app like Squid for me it's simple to use and professional. I can PDF my files and photos and everything else from this app. I give it ☆☆☆☆☆☆ stars 🌟 and more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"favorite app to use with stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. It needs some minor details to improve productivity but it's fair for the premium price. One minor thing would be to be able to choose where to put the control panel in the screen. Also to modify automatically the caliber of the pencil according to the zoom."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I purchased Squid to get all the templates for various note taking options. It is working well and I only removed a star as I would like to be able to create a template."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app for all notes and plans super easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is the best and free note taking app for Google Pixel Slate. The pixel styles works well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have to buy premium to add text seriously !!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Have just tried this app, and it mostly seems very well designed. It's quite disappointing that there's no dark mode available. I have no choice but to look at the glaring white pages: no matter the time of day. Most have some sort of inverted colour scheme available these days. Until Squid provides a similar option, it's unusable to me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really useful app for making notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is missing a few features that could easily put it over the top. 1. Black backgrounds 2. Toggle lock editing for individual pages 3. Toggle lock zoom amount for individual pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for studying"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love how the app works, I LOVE EVERYTHING IN IT, There is only 1 thing I would love to have, to have even more zoom, because I would want to have ultra small dots and text, that's the only thing I want MORE ZOOM! This app is an exam saver"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Paired with the tab 6 lite it's been a productivity game changer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can you add a dark theme"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best note taking app for any android device. Notes can be easily organized into libraries, exported into PDF and backed up either online or locally. I enjoy using squid a lot!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app.... kindly give search option in next update...so that one can search the notes by its title."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app. My favorite to use out of all the ones I've tried. I just wish you could put things into folders rather than everything be individual."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best apps for student..enough for school and will always be my favourite writing note apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good all round, I have been using this for quite a while. There are a few suggestions that would make it even better. 1. Have a search function. 2. A rotate image option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Original review disappeared?? Good app but I don't like the subscription model which seems massively expensive for what it is. I previously mentioned the lack of being able to change the background colour which is helpful for dyslexic people. The response I got said you can, which is true for the plain paper but nothing else so this could be improved."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recently bought an inexpensive Samsung Android tablet, and Squid was the first app I installed. Game changer! I use it every day, all day. I use it in mornings for taking notes on my Bible study, and of course at work all day. I especially like the ability to snap a photo, add notes, and the export to PDF. Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App excelente para estudar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"has potential but Samsung notes has more writing utensils and I don't have to pay for anything. uninstalling and unsubscribing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Interface needs night mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great. Would definitely prefer to use literally any other method of backing my files up other than dropbox (which costs far too much and is the absolute worst option). As well as the ability to backup my files sooner than every 6 hours. A lot of work can be lost in that amount of time. Aside from that the app is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying using Squid for recording hand written notes it does this very well. Two features I would really like to see 1) Custom background templates (I have a Pdf I would like to use as my default page template ) and 2) Some sort of synchronization, with many similar apps I can take notes on my phone or tablet and they stay syncronited with eachother."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Best note taking app available on android, but still a long way to go. Better documentation of gestures would be great, as would the ability to open notes side by side like on Notability. I also wish I could rotate drawn text, and that it was possible to select and manipulate parts of imported pdfs without leaving the app. Rotating pdfs would be great too. I do quite appreciate the ability to import pdfs, change color and thickness of selected strokes, and export files so easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add scrible noise while writing then it will feel more wonderful during writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is good except the part where there is no control to temporarily hide the navigation bar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant on my fold 4, complete replacement for my hard notebook but with additional features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been amazing for me. For note taking and drawing, it's been solid for me. Now i know this app is primarily for note taking but it would be nice if it had a few more drawing features like paint bucket tool, color picker tool, layers and rotating anything selected by the lasso tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"nice app and I would be prepared to pay for the app but the subscription model is a bit much. One feature that seems to be missing is the ability to change the paper colour, this really helpful for dyslexic people."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The scaling from type to page isnt perfect but its much more better than the other apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for me to study"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app but a couple of things keep me from giving them 5 stars: feedback link is broken, no G-drive cloud access (only box and Dropbox) and no syncing between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"what on earth is this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is a very good app...but there supposed to be eraser."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even try it without paying. Not going to pay for an app until I see how it works!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Used it for a year. Helpful in many ways. As long as I have a digital pen, this app allows me to write down notes effectively and draw freely. The touch sensitivity is amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app to take notes without notebook 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Cant erase manual,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ready and fun to use"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been amazing. I've been having fun with drawing on the infinite canvas. Now I know this app is primarily for note taking but it would be nice to have more drawing features like a paint bucket tool and the option to rotate selected things. That would be nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app does not sync with other devices which is frustrating. More improvement needs to be done to the system to compete with new similar apps coming up"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would love more features but great app for price"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love writing my notes with Squid on Samsung Tab 8 Ultra"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Restored purchases do not restore previously purchased functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient, easy to use. Perfect for students who wish to modify or add to the pdf's the teacher gave."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Cost money to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"really great app, bought premium 5 minutes after use, but one thing that would make it even better would be a pc version so you can quickly open your phone notes on pc and edit them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works well for school and work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed with the premium version, adds really little to the free version. Waste of money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The widgets are dull.. Make the actual note stand out out as a widget in the home screen that gives real info instead of the icon, so 4* for now.. Otherwise a great app one of the best in class.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Though I am busy right now, the app asked for a review and this is the best i can do till i buy a subscription when needed. Words can't describe how much i love this app.. It's all you want for taking notes. Love the infinite paper idea. It makes it so much easier to arrange your notes and saves you time as you don't have to plan too much and can get right away into it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You can do one time payments instead of a subscription for just the parts you want/need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has become my go to all notes platform. I've set up different books and use the date for a reminder. It has been amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pay to use pdf functionality"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After buying premium plan money got deducted but features are still not available. Thank you for loss of my money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's a great note taking app you can relax and take notes at the same time. It's like a digital Smart board"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Study App ever! Used to see this app in high school and scoffed but now that most textbooks and reading material is pdf really liking it! Would like to have the text box and shapes to be created and asked to change dimensions of it rather than drawing it all at once. Don't know how to use most of the insert pages but from what 1 can they are solid!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it highly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for making notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect tool for in the field! I'm a commercial interior designer, and I can't begin to tell you how nice it is to be able to download plans and mark them up on site. I can also print directly from my phone which is a definite added bonus! Best app I've ever paid for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I bought tools pack only on my samsung tab. Then when i installed this apps on my mobile phone the tools pack cannot use. Only can use in the device (samsung tab) that i bought the tools pack only. Other device cannot use. Please upgrade for tools pack can be use in many device using 1 account only. And also please make and account for user out there like me that use 2-3 device to use the tools pack/premium pack can just bought 1 and use it in many device. What if i accidentally deleted the app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very Productive app but purchased bunch of packs and upgraded phones never got them back. I would love to see a predictive stroke option to this app make your writing and calligraphy slightly neater"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years. Great for taking notes, pictures, and the ability to share these as a pdf us tremendously helpful. Allows you to write on pdf's with my stylus so I don't have to print and sign pages. I recommend this product."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than onenote ,simple layout but functional and the premium is also affordable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple and reliable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great UI and functionality. For suggestions on improvement, I wish we had a bit more versatility with screen-grabbing and shape-drawing. I can't really use it on PDFs I import into the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"NOTHING IN EVERYTHING ONLY THE BRAVES WRITE IT."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please add full screen mode feature. Sometimes it's difficult to write as the palm touches home screen and it's back to home."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The edit interface needs improvement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I lost all my schoolwork for 2 years becuse the app uninstalled itself and then reinstalled! It was a perfect app but now I am pissed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app daily. I wont lie, I didn't love the idea of paying for a subscription, but I did. Now, honestly, I couldn't see myself going back to not using it. Even before I got the hang of all the little extra things I could do with it, this app had become a staple in my organizational needs. Now, I think I would cry if it stopped working. Like I said, I am on it multiple times daily!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing.. keren banget. Saya suka aplikasi ini krn : 1. Goresan pena sgt alami dan lancar 2. Hasil tulisan pena bisa di save slm bentuk pdf yg mudah disimpan atau di share 3. Rasanya sprt punya pocket agenda"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After changed my phone and reinstalled this app, I found that my subscription on premium is unavailable. I rechecked my Google subscription. Squid is there and the subscription is until next year. I uninstalled and reinstalled for many times, still not in premium. Why?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really good app for note taking and editing pdfs. No latency, very responsive. The reason I'm not using this as my main stylus app is that there is not a pro version, only the option to subscribe or to pay in-app for individual features -- the problem being that none of these can be shared on Family Library whereas apps that have a paid pro version can be. Until this changes I'd recommend Noteshelf."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good. i have a subscription. would be nice if the tool bar had more options. for example if the eraser, pen, pointer, highlighter options, could all be placed at the tool bar for quick selection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Literally useful. Go Green."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is by far my most used app as an engineer. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellant"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot, but it does not transfer notes from device to device. If they were to approach this issue, this would be a 5 star app for sure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've had s really nice experience with the app so far, however I would like to be able to create subfolders and sort notes manually. That functionality is really missing!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using Squid for about the past year to make grid maps for a text-based game (a MUD), and have been very pleased with the results. Minor requests: considering how many files I've accumulated now, it would be nice if the app had a search feature. Additionally, if you had the capability to type in the line/text size instead of using the meter bar, you could quickly get the thickness you want than to keep jumping back and forth until you land on your desired results. Thanks for the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helps me learn by passion and willpower; I can illustrate my thoughts!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste of money and time... don't take subscription.. There is very relation between stylus pen and screen..... I feel very very very bad experience....😭😭"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect. But from this team I will expect continuous actualizations that will make it a perfect app with time. One of those, I hope it will be the compatibility with more active pens like the Xiaomi's stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful, easy-to-use, worth the sub <3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! My preferred note taking and mark-up app. Please add this feature: Different default zoom levels for portrait and landscape device orientation (e.g. Portrait: Fit Height; Landscape: Fit Width). This would allow me to easily view full pages, and also to easily mark them up as well. ------------------------------------ Thanks for your reply. Btw, I get a CloudFare error when I go to that site. [2022-Oct-02]"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helped a lot to solve problems in my tab"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool that I use for tutoring. Organises notes very well and easy to import and edit PDF's using a digital inking pen. A few more shortcuts and additional tools would take it to the next level!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. I use it all of the time for school readings, I upload the pdf and am able totake notes about the text right next to the topic we're discussig. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the app is subscription based. I would prefer to just purchase the app and not worry about a subsription. The monthly price is just a buck but still I would orefer to just purchase the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It good but needs more pen options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use a definitely worth $7 per year"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Low latency, lots of options. The only piece it's lacking is the the pen variety that other apps have. Having said that, I'm not sure if few pen options keeps the latency down. Highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for study if u are student who can by hard only by writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Currently, Squid is the most responsive note taking app available on the Chromebook platform and because of this, everyone is stuck with Squid. The developers know this too! That's why they have a subscription model, but never update their app! As I'm writing this, the last update was 9+ months ago! App is constantly crashing! Looks like it's using too many resources! No Quick access bar to color changes, highlights or lasso tool like OneNote. No Quick pasting access. No quick page editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not intresting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works quite well for a Chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is wonderful in so many ways, BUT! Please enable scrolling between pages, both in regular squid notes and in imported PDF's, instead of having to click the tiny arrow in the upright corner. If that feature is enabled this becomes a five star review. Another cool feature would be to be able to rotate and flip objects that you've ""marked"" with the square or lasso. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing for making notes during uni lecture presentation ! Highly recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to write (with figure or pen). Erasing is also easy (with two figures)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Could be great, but just isn't. Crashes a lot. Has very few tools, even with the paid version. It gets the job done, but not well. You can import and export documents and pictures, mark them up, and draw on them, but its very simplistic yet still has tons of bugs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Had a bad review due to a bug, but it is sorted! Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why is there no palm rejection in this app? Bcoz whenever I touch my palm, some things I have wrote will be erased, without using the eraser. I request you to assist me in this regard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"pretty good especially for college and save paper. lags a bit bit besides that would recommend for college students!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple interface, works smoothly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is really easy to use and does not fail to open notes. It is way better than evernote and does not cost as much. You can also do more with the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice 🙂"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for taking notes during medical classes. I never run out of paper and there's no clutter my only feed back is I wish this had the option to change pen tips rather just the simple ball point pen design. Samsung note has great options if developers needs a perfecte example of what Im talking about."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for notes and to read book"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works well with Chromebook and a stylus. I wish it had more sync and share capabilities."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost best app. I miss two things in this app. First is the OCR and ""writing to text"" conversion ability not being present in the app, and second is that ""search of the hand written text"" is also absent. Else I like it's ability to annotate PDFs and the ability of adding pages in between the PDFs as per your wish, and managing the orders of the pages is also good. File management is also good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Utility"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs a way to organize pdfss into sub folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has done almost everything I've asked of it, don't like that the colors are behind a paywall and the ability to insert pdfs was $5 but imo way worth it especially since I can take notes directly on the handouts and upload hex grid paper for ochem notes. There's no pen lag and is just super convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I use this app for work daily and it constantly crashes and never saves my work. this app is useful for simple notes but for important note writing such as for work and school, I would look into better alternatives."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app overall. Easy to export files in different formats. A pity you have to switch between the pen and the eraser using a single button."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Allows me to study and do homework via an ipad. This app enables me to draw diagrams for many subjects which aids my studying. i can not believe this app is free! Although various things are unlocked due to me not purchasing premium it allows many options, great for writing and doing homework! Minimal adds, infact I haven't experienced any!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick and convenient!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"First time using it. This app allowed to use normal note n if want more grid or lines... U pay for premium. Fair enough. No unnecessary advertisement n tht encourage me to stick to this app. Thk u."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fitur Premium kebanyakan"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"In their quick little blurb it ends with and share... But yet there is no way to share notebooks with friends. Also the only way to back up is through dropbox or box not even Google Drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great note-taking app, but the app doesn't allow or support split-screen. This would be a really convenient feature to have so that you could take notes while reading an online textbook (which many textbooks are becoming), while on an cloud-based laptop like a Chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Takes far too long to load a simple note. Edit: my mistake it was another app not this one. 5* squid is bloody awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than the Android version of one note, could use features such as Shape recognition and dotted lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"keeps freezing due to palm rejection issue Google Pixel book."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, one problem: This is an awesome app- it has all the basic features that a good notes app needs and is well organized. I take notes on this regularly and it works well, I highly recommend it. (The premium version where you can download and write on pdfs is also definitely worth the price if you use pdfs often). The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it sometimes crashes after opening- once it is started it runs well, but it sometimes takes up to 10 tries to run it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesnt tell you it won't open PDFs without you paying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it a lot. It would be even better with following features 1. Sort by notebooks (as i see too many notes in recent notes) 2. Select text to copy in pdf feature"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It good and nize"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is in all honesty the only app I pay for premium features. It is very easy to use and super user friendly. I like the various page options and the pen settings. I wish there was a multi-device syn feature, but exporting and sharing squid notes is very easy, so I am not complaining."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good! exactly what I was looking for, I've recommended this to my friends in college"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app because from many days I am finding a Nate taking app and I found this 100000 stars for this"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"""Best Note Taking App For Android"", and I hope it stays that way. First used it around 2018, with my new bought samsung chromebook plus, and it works like a charm. Initially it was buggy, but the new upgrades really fixed them well. Worth all the price. Edit (20th August, 2022):- How do I get the Squid10 Beta in my new chromebook? Please I require aid, Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Its not too bad but taking notes on a pdf is for premium version."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have created my own planner pdf with hyper links however this app doesn't support hyperlinked pdfs I guess. Such a bummer, otherwise good app but lacks features... Going back to Samsung notes on my z fold 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app. Would be nice if the background could be changed to a different color when writing a note. If that is part of the premium pkg, then I understand. $10/yr just to change the background color? 🤔 May have to think about it. Would be nice if there was a 24hr trial period. Any chance for a dark theme in the future? Still a very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for engineers in the field"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its the best notes that i used. but sadly, i using huawei matepad, so i can't purchase the premium. i really like to purchase the premium because it have a lot of items to use. so, it can only purchase using the google user, but can you kindly suggest or do another method of payment for who those don't have any google user?

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes, if it had cloud sharing of notes it would be much better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, i have an old tablet but it works so well. Premium is worth it for a very small price"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best. I've used pretty much every note-taking app on Winows, iPad and Android and always come back to Squid. Gets the basics right. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Its a great app, with hands down the best features found in a note taking app but the only thing I dont like is that we need to have premium for syncing notes on other device cause like its the only thing that matters to me in note taking apps which is syncing option which is not in squid so its a big turn off."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Never been a day without its great service"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"recently just comeback using squid for note taking and found that there are quite some new features as compared to the last time i used it. i like how the developers are always open in taking in suggestions and improving the apps. Although it may take years for that to be implemented, but at least i finally get the features i wanted. Thanks developers 😄"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love using this app for taking notes in college, and while at work, it works well and has tons of useful features. A couple features I would love to see added is a fill feature for filling in drawings with a color and some more shapes added in the shape tools section."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst experience recently. The update had a problem and prompted me to create a backup (which turned out to be corrupted). So, I lost ALL my files for the past 2 years. :( Still waiting for a feedback from support, hope they can retrieve my files."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the Best Notes App..no competition ! Hands down"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app till date 💯"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Was OK at first, now has two MAJOR problems: 1. The (paid) sync option through dropbox is a JOKE. It doesn't happen real-time, it doesn't sync between devices - if you want your phone to have the laptop version of your files, you have to sync it manually. The Process is slow and has the added disadvantage of wiping whatever squid files you have on the receiving device. 2. THE APP KEEPS CRASHING. I used it a lot for studying, no more. I wouldn't download or buy if I were you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good but not better than Microsoft OneNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm using Pixelbook OG i5 +Inking is fast, smooth and accurate. Stands with the best. Though it looks terrible on Acer 713 11th Gen i7. I returned the device for that reason. +Allows page sizes (letter, A4 etc) and multiple page notes. Absolute must for paper replacement creation and printing. +Imports and Exports PDFs +Supports local and Dropbox backup/restore -No sync support for multiple devices -Google Drive is not supported at all. Please give us GOOGLE DRIVE SYNC!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I can write on this fluidly just like on a paper, like it very much, I can take office notes, has become a daily use app. Thanks to the app creators."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like the app, I'm currently a premium subscriber because of a class so I am using the app a lot and really enjoying it. One thing I wish I could do is overlay over a pdf a pattern (or I guess change the background of an imported pdf without altering the stuff written on it) - for example, I import my class workbooks and I am writing the answers by hand, but I wish I could change the background of the PDF I imported (or overlay it) with lined paper (or dotted)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I just wish it had a function to at least search for note titles, maybe a couple of search filters ie date, notebook etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's okay. But the writing seems bad. Would have been great if you had a collection of pens with different writing styles, like one other similar app in playstore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid notes is unique and surprisingly useful. After buying an Android, I didn't have access to apps such as good notes 5 and notability. Squid was a good alternative and gave me the freedom to room in to 1000%. I gave 4/5 because I would of liked more templates, more writing functions with the pen, and I wanted to highlight text without it affecting the colour of the text - it would become slightly blurred. This app has great potential and I would definitely recommend this for notetaking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Decent for basic notetaking, but there are two things that I would need in order to use Squid regularly: highlighting UNDER text (similar to Goodnotes on iOS) and cloud backup on more than just Dropbox and Box. My preference is Onedrive, but I'd settle for Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for general note taking. I would say the biggest flaw is that there is no way to see your notes off of the app unless you export them to something like onenote. Another frustrating thing is that you can't modify images once they're added to a sheet as far as I can tell."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with Samsung S-Pen Devices. I primarily use as a PDF editor of drawings. The UI is great for both freehand & inputted text. I do wish syncing to other Android devices was native, but the automatic save to local prevents lost data in a connection failure. One feature I really like is that one can export individual pages easily. So now I primarily use this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"PDF page swiping or scrolling is a much needed feature. When you import a PDF for annotation, you've to click on the arrow every time to navigate between the pages. Imagine editing a 100 page PDF and you aren't able to swipe across pages. Bad experience for a premium price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"UPDATE: Gotta say that while this app was the best at the time of downloading, the lack of searching through notes (either handwriting or searching) and difficulty combing through my pages of notes (and massive note sizes) has pushed me to other apps. Especially when those do not have a subscription service. Besides those two critical things that have had no improvements in the last couple of years, this app is good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice, works perfectly on chrome OS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"😃 great!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for what I need it for. Easy to use as well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is not backing up everyday despite having my settings configured to do so This was resolved"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for my college. Easy notes on the go, never need a notebook (as long as I have my tablet), and I can section off my classes. I have been using for two semesters. Very simple, no issues, love it. ❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Needs a text rotation function. It's all I want for University note taking. Regardless, it's still the best thing for note taking for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nicely designed app. Works smoothly and enjoyable to use . Very (very!) grateful for no ads, and one-time pay option for enhanced options. Also, there is an excellent tutorial that is built into the app. Very happy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cooool❤❤❤❤❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best program helps me, it is the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Overall a good program, but it is missing some features that would be nice. Tabs on PDF documents don't work for some reason..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd love to see an option for colored pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app for writing and typing over a pdf document as it's simple and responsive. Did not hesitate to purchase the tool pack and PDF import modules after first trial. (Updated: Thanks to developer for responding to my comments concerning syncing notes and unlocking paid modules across multiple devices. I followed the instructions and it works!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is super useful with my college class. It's super convenient and doesn't lag a ton like OneNote often does for me. The interface is smooth and does what it's supposed to do. The subscription isn't really a huge deal, because it's literally just 1 dollar every month which is about as generous as it gets. Even a college student can afford it. If you have a tablet and a pen this is probably the BEST note taking app imo. It's not too convoluted and it's simple and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please, create a shortcut to open notes on the home screen. You already have Create note and open notebook, but open note would be really useful. EDIT 1: The shortcut is totally possible for Android. It could be implemented the same way as you've implemented shortcuts for notebooks. But instead of just having shortcuts for notebooks, have them for notes too. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have found this app very useful for taking notes and for reading ebooks. For me, this app is the best I have used so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app especially for a device with a pen (Spen) the drawing and, editing, panning and selecting is much more fluid than in Samsung own notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Worth the upgrade to premium 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"not any word to explain my happiness ❤️❤️❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Ditch paper?! Ditch you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing I don't like is that it's not easy to share between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Forces you to buy a subscription to unlock all features. I should be able to purchase the full app once. Not pay 10 every year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for android note-taking and pdf markup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Sauid is the best app and it helped me a lot in notes taking I prefer you all to download it as it helps a lot in your notes A big thankyou to squid...😁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I need a pdf editor. I install one and I see I need to pay to import a pdf. What would I rate this app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In free, they provide enough features and everything works fine."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Intuitive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"While viewing a pdf and marking the index option for PDF is not available. In a book of 1000 pages you have to search while going from 1 chapter to other. It takes a lot of time. I think this option should be provided"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"awesome but needs different coloured backgrounds for note templates like grey or beige. need google drive/microsoft onedrive auto sync backups. prefer this app over all other handwriting apps on android or iphone due to zero learning curve & ease of adding images in unlike notability etc. wish iphone had it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App works well when it's working. I love all the different backgrounds and as someone who would rather handwrite my notes than type them, the lag when using an active pen is minimal, so that is appreciated. However, the app will glitch out every few minutes where the entire screen is blurred out and its just a mix match of lines on my screen. This happens when I'm opening a new note, changing the page in a note, my screen rotates or sometimes I dont have to do anything at all. Very frustrating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I cannot download it stucks at 83 percent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful app for teaching. All the foundamentals features are implemented: cloud backup of the notes database providing seemless switch to new devices, cloud backup in pdf, export and edit notes. Recommended. Feature request: subfolders for better notes organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love how it can zoom in or out easily. Helps me in my note taking and revisions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great study tool, and the paid version is a very reasonable price for the features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I like the app because it's useful. It has the best pen to screen input on Android and ChromeOS. However, the app could really really really use a new interface. The app looks like something out of 2017. It would also like to add that a feature to change the theme would be nice, cyan and orange really isn't a great color combo along with dark mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App works as it is suppose too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a very nice app/ Diary with nice features, one thing i would suggest is that when you write in a particular folder it keeps a copy in the recent also which is not required. The rest is beautiful !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for three years I use it to make nice sketches by drawing over pictures and handwriting notes Please if possible add the ability to fill in a certain part of a delineated section so I may colour my sketches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, I like alot about it and I've been using it for a while now but I absolutely hate the fact that it doesn't have dark mode. This is a necessary app feature at this point and I think it would be better if we can change the font style too,it'll be useful for writing headings or subheadings. And is there a way to disable the finger eraser feature ,since I'm left handed its really inconvenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent writing and erasing, but there are two problems. The eraser doesn't scale with zoom(1000% really big 10% miniscule) and the way of changing from writing to geom. shapes and changing colors is tidious. If I'm writing and want to draw a straight line I have to click on the pencil select the shapes and select the line then draw it. Same with colors if there were 3 last used it would help. Basically have the options layed out and not ""hidden"" in menus. And drawing circles from the middle."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like a lot about this app. However, I wish I could change the background colors for my notes, while maintaining grids/layouts for better contrast. I absolutely HATE that the most useful (to me) additional features are locked behind a subscription, I would be much happier with a one-time upgrade fee for all ""premium features"". For some reason, importing PDFs is a feature that can be unlocked with a one-time fee, but not additional layouts? Wack."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Misleading Advertising: To markup PDF's you must purchase the premium subscription. Downloaded for this purpose, already have a note app. Will not install again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really enjoyed to use this app, just one suggestion: Incorporate to the app a ruler or more math and measurement tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does everything we need and more"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use squid frequently for taking notes in class and during clinical rotations. I like it for its simplicity and ease of use. I like that I can take pictures and paste them directly to the note. One feature that I would like to see in future updates is the ability to create custom sized notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for note taking and writing longer documents. I have been using it for two years now. The only thing I'd ask for is a mode for creating and presenting slide shows."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Forced into paying to trial upload pdf functionality, only to find that pdfs can't be swiped to next page, you need to hit the arrow. What terrible functionality. Cancelled forced subscription within an hour and deleted the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for pdf editing. Great for contracts, adding photos and extra pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid makes my life so much easier!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, it has significantly increased my productivity!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Stopped working and lost 2 months worth of files. Had the app for 2 years and subbed to the premium subscription. It was perfect for me personally. But now I cannot even open the app on my tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bada$$ app.... highly recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"why I can't use the grids and dots notes? And I can't use the paper sizes too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"There must be an laser pointer mode for presentation and if shapes are inserted there is no option to fill the color in shape."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I have been using a pixelbook with a pixel pen with Squid to draw. Recently, I found the app unresponsive frequently that require me to reboot. All other apps work except Squid. It wasn't like that a year ago but it has been like that in the past few months. Anyone has similar experience?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"exactly what I needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty awesome note taking/sketching app. l just wish it synced across devices and you could change the orientation of PDF's and then it would be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very basic note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's very good, it just needs OneDrive \ Google integration!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"[Chromebook] Mostly a great experience. The stylus recognition is really good and there is minimal to no lag when writing. The subscription fee for the nicer features is very affordable as of writing this. Only complaint is that when you erase, it erases the entire stroke, i.e. what you wrote without lifting. So when you draw lines and try to trim it, it just removes the entire line. It would be nice to be able to erase just parts of a stroke."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No bautify function for handwriting. Everything else is cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good value for money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome. I tried 100 others apps, only this has infinite page and this is cool."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use squid for taking quick notes, as well as quickly drawing an idea so I don't forget it. The drawing is quite precise for a free app on a relatively small screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't get it, why will i use this app, while it doesn't integrate with google notes, or my phone notes that i already have. And that's free 2 use. This app Have a weird display interface, everything is pay2use. And not only that it also has no clear use, if u don't have a big screen with built in stylus for ur phone. ( I thought it recorded everything we write as the doodled handwritten note.) If you have to write myself in a line on a phone on a normal screen sized display, good luck."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"mostly really useful. even as a free user"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm paying the premium subscription, but so far don't see a good reason to do so vs. a one-time payment. The app hasn't updated in months, and feature-requests are still unanswered years later. Over the few years I've subscribed, I don't recall a single update that improved my app experience. For my use case, I've voted for some (seemingly) basic PDF features, like following links and importing the table of contents, but am losing hope that any meaningful development might happen here."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good but No widget, plz add it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love the app Here's my feedback tho As a perspect looking to go school soon, I'm worried about using this as my primary app due random crashes and the fact there there no keyboard shortcuts to help speed up projects"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very good app but some basic features hid behind a paywall for example highlighting which is a shame. The UI isn't great but it's fine overall. One big problem is that I have to go into a submenu to use the eraser tool which should be on the default menu. No ability to customize the UI or map the buttons on my stylus to anything other than the default."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Liar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it, it's very easy and fast"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absoultly love Squid! It is so easy to use and get the hang of. It has helped so much for my college classes. The premium only being a $1 /month is a plus, finally someone who knows a resonable price for college students. Only thing I wish for is to be able to open two notes at a time it would really help in being able to use past notes for current homework assignments"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Subscription (i.e rental). Despite the developer response, they do not offer a single purchase option and indeed have written an entire article justifying their position. That's fine but I prefer to buy my apps outright and not rent them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love everything about this app, it's adorable, I like the way notebooks are setup, but I really wish there was a night mode, without it my eyes hurt a lot and the app absolutely drains my tablet, but other than that, I'd give this app 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's been great at taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app but I have only 1 problem that is i do not a Lenovo pen 🙃☹️😪 remaining all is best in this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app,it's great to be able to use colors and design to create. I only wish the documents could be shared between 2 devices or were attached to your account some how."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally a great app for taking quick notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Any time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and convenient! It's my go to app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is simple to use, quick to learn, and is perfect for any high octane student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"BEST APP EVER!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good stuff"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Had to pay for ability to type with text. Working with squid was ok. Cannot scroll screen when editing except with keyboard arrows. Worst, notes I typed previous evening disappeared. The not page is still there, but it is empty. Copied all my notes to other app so as to ensure they are safe. Have to re-do my lost notes. Not helpful!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good: -It works well, and the interface is nice. -It is also very nice to be able set it up to erase with your finger (after taking notes with your stylus wacom or active based). It is relatively easy to export to jpg or locally to the device or google drive. -There is a cast button that lets you cast to google devices... like nest hubs and chrome cast... I have not tried in the office with Google Meet conference hardware, but will update when I do. -They don't have their own weird cloud. This app is standalone and does not need an account with whoever devs Squid. -You can lasso inserted photos and move them Bad: -The erase with your finger option is negated by the fact that when the palm rejection doesn't work (which happens often), ends up erasing your notes (I guess this is more problematic for me since I am left handed). I had to turn it off. -There is no option to auto backup to Google Drive or OneDrive. This is particularly upsetting, because unless you remember to manually backup, you may lose your device and your notes. To do that you would have to use Dropbox or Box (i am not about to get another service just for this app). Also, given that those two are the most popular cloud services for business, it makes it impossible for me to propose the adoption of this app at work. -This app is subscription based. Premium features cost per month/year... not single purchase like INKredible. I guess you can buy features one at a time, but that doesn't seem like a good idea to me. I am still on the fence of which app to keep."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for 2 semesters and its perfect for notes, totally worth the subscription fee. Most comfortable app for Android system"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"was great at the beginning, but it now crashes every time I use it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and stable. I use it on the Chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I love that I can create separate notebooks for each of my subjects and can choose different backgrounds for my notes. It's easy to bring PDFs in as well. Overall, great app for everyday use and for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, would like to convert word to pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my favorite app for school.- Being able to mark my PDF's is a lifesaver."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm when importing PDF to edit with sylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great little note taking app for my Samsung Tab S7 Plus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good. An interoperability with a PC might be better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is miles ahead of any other active stylus notetaking solution for Chromebooks. It 'just works.' It isn't super limited, has all standard pen tools and export options, organizes pages well, and has low-latency, pressure sensitive input. No solutions from Google or other players match it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, actually lets you mark up pdf's with out an extra charge."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"brilliant app for a tablet with pen, good for jotting down ideas & notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great note taking app. easy to use and no lag on my Chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great App, I have Premium and use it for my work everyday, but why it doesnt have search item, to search the name of the note or search in the Pages, because I have sometimes in one note more than 300 pages and I need to find a special page which without searching the word is not easy at all. I would appreciate for your Feedback:)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app that's okay. Maybe you can improve it adding different types of writing letter. Could add a rule with angular orientation. The capacity of adding tables, o graphics. But add many different types of writing letter its enough for me :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente APP. Muito bom para estudar e tomar notas. Sugestão de melhoria: Acho que poderiam melhorar a parte de organizar as notas, talvez criar pastas."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you fo this exceptionally well crafted piece of software. All wanted features, clean and minimal, good feel ❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"it is all in app purchases basically. You want basic note templates ?Give us money. You want useable tools to write, use text boxes, ect. ? Givl.Us. Money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I spend way too much money for this app to crash this often. At least once per class, if not 5 or 6 times."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have been loving this app! It is perfect for taking notes in class and keeping them organized. I am currently a high school student and use the free version of the app. I will be going to university navy year and plan on getting the premium version. I like that it is affordable and has many helpful tools but also appreciate how usable the free version is as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I mostly love it. Wish there was a way to be more intuitive with paging and I miss pdf functions like readers that reflower text, but with my vision, I love importing (& sometimes scanning) documents in quickly for easier reading in meetings and trainings and reviewing proposals on the fly with notes before circulating to my team."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please add folders feature to arrange my notes, Also add quick acess color change."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is really good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have bought its premium. Which does not have a live backup system. For this reason we cannot use it on other devices or in the web version. Due to which there is lot of trouble. please fix"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work with PDF in the free version. Literally has PDF in the name of the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Kept showing a scrambled screen when opening up notes. Everything is updated including my chrome OS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than factory default app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Helps me take notes for classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this APP. It does everything I ever wanted in a handwriting app. You do have to figure out the pens to get a smoother line. INKcredible does have a smoother line, and caligraphy. But that is all that is better. Squid is the BEST app EVER."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great little sketch tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"really good experiance, right now im sick and need to work on my school work, this has emproved my skills and help me exceed in my schooling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So close to perfect! I very much want to support this app except there is no way to carry out a subscription except through Play Store. Some of the features that are pro are certainly worth the price, but a more decentralized option would be worth 5 stars and twice the subscription rate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing UX. But would be awesome to add chapters to notes, then I would rate 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can use it for business pleasure or anything. Perfect tool for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"crashes a lot but good for notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outstanding performance ❤️❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"OPTIMAL"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice simple easy good for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"this would be a great app if it'd let you back up to more places than dropbox and box. You can't even schedule local backups to work around this, they're manual only, making them almost useless. scheduled backups are cloud-only, somehow."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's gud but not that much good kilo notes is best app for notes making"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use a Huawei M5 Lite and active stylus. Been using the free version of Squid for two years for note-taking on projects, scribbled diagrams and snipped crosswords and sudokus. It’s not blighted by adverts or excessive prompting to go premium, no limitations on notebook sizes – I’ve >130 pages in one notebook – and no petty restrictions that limit its usefulness. I use pdf export to transfer notebooks and will upgrade to premium to use Dropbox and other features. Thoroughly recommend it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app , but can I hide tool bar above so that I can work in full screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome , love it using for tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sucks like hell I would give it no stars if the option allowed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Downloaded it for the sole reason of marking up pdfs. All my Korean learning textbooks and workbooks are pdfs so i needed a way to write on them on my Amazon tablet. Found out the marking up pdfs option is for premium only. If you need to pay for it then why not say it in the description? However the normal note taking part is decent, I really liked it because it was easy to use, but the pdf issue through me off. Please update the description and tell us you need to pay to mark up pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"cant use pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Basic features such as highlighter need to be Purchased, ruined my excitement tbh uninstalled within 5mins"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why premium ughhh"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very disappointing. People have been asking for cross device sync and Drive Backup for 2 years, but still zero development. For a premium app, that's very much a let down. Now cancelled my subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a really great app for STEM students. It's totally worth the subscription fee. I love that it has a shape drawing tool for perfect lines, boxes, and circles. Biggest downside is there is no syncing across devices and since there is no account you log into, you're stuck with premium on one divices only. It will do backup to the Drop Box service, but Drop Box costs money as well. This app would be flawless if it could either sync to my computer, or auto backup to Google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and nice view"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this app almost every day. Very easy to use and a valuable tool. I recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what I want it to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect app for keeping note of the daily important tasks in your life... but you ABSOLUTELY can't delete the notes you've created!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely 💯 % Fantastic! I love this app! 😊. So many great options & works flawlessly! Just could have more widget options.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for students to write things if premium there please take it for copying and pasting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I installed and immediately Uninstalled because you cannot change colors for all backgrounds. Defeats the purpose of organizing notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ease of use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, use it every day for note taking at work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Many positive reviews but useless to me PDF zooming not maintained while page turning.... While other apps does a beautiful job what's wrong with this one... this one made me cancel my subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"it doesn't sync to other devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome performance,Love you squid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great stylus latency and overall really good for note taking and annotating, but some key missing features (no easy way to next/prev page in view mode which makes it very frustrating to use as a reader, no hierarchical note management)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Liking it very much! Started on good notes but very small on my iphone so thought I'd try this on my Samsung tablet instead of buying an ipad. Works very well! Bought a planner template off Etsy. The pdf transfers very well but the page links don't work. Still this is very customizable and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not what I needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very bad 👎"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it for 2 days. preparing for my nasty divorce with 24 years worth of notes. I like that I can paste all of the emails, then highlight the incriminating evidence and then switch to a pen and write my own notes too. With Squid, I don't need to hire an attorney (Not that I can afford one anyway :) I love the infinite paper! She can't win & I owe it to you! I want her to install it so I can share & she'll see she can't win & stop this. I'd love to see yellow legal pads for a paper option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What I like about this app is the limitless canvas available, which I find useful. The reason for this is when I'm doing mathematical calculations it's handy to be able to keep the last step in sight when scrolling down for more space. With a page turning approach you completely lose from sight the work you have done, which can be annoying. I imagine the same thing applies when making designs so this app overcomes the restrictions of a cell phone screen. It' s also has a fairly simple interface."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The free version has everything you could want for taking notes and organizing everything. Super easy to copy/paste/delete chunks of text. Highly recommend for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"my tab is xaiomi, i bought the 1yr sub because it has a good latency compared to other note taking apps. pls improve more hehehe.thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Incredible app, miss some features like rounded eraser instead of square, drive integration and automatic shape recognition, but really good overall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am glad to know that there is such an app on android. I would like to see every tool used for taking a note is stand alone. So if I wanted to use the pen or the eraser I can choose them or any other tool immediately without the interruption of the tool menu. And I am ofcourse going premium it's so affordable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it so much, I can tell this will be a daily use app for me. It's easy, straightforward, and there are so many different uses for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Sure"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"would give 5 stars if they added a geometric shapes tool that you can create by drawing certain shapes and them turning out into a straight circle\triangular\square"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really love the writing experience (much better than xodo) but would like it even better if it could overwrite annotated pdf documents directly and sync with Google drive. Despite getting the premium, I'm going back to xood because of this :'("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The only thing this app is good for costs 5 dollars. This isn't a free app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful, user friendly and an excellent resource to replace paper. I am an HSE consultant and use it as a ""clipboard and paper"" while conducting surveys. I also use it to sign documents rather than printing and scanning after completing the document. Proposal: you can maybe look into creating more notebook styles (gratitude journal, prayer journal, mental health journals) and/or project planning options, such as workflow sheet, project summary sheet, project scope sheet, etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Keep continuously crashing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"buena apr"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Personally squid is an amazing app for an android user myself this had made my life better this is one of the app that I ever regret Dowlanding although without an apple pencil or stylus it is difficult to write its still a good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Giving it four stars coz it really works fine for my classes and so on, however you guys need to improve the back up features to allow me to use Google Drive and not only Dropbox"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No Dark theme....😏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You guys have made a nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd like to read the notes easily that I have taken, on another platform like Windows and keep them up to date. It is tough to back up every time as a Pdf. It would be great if the app has automatically Pdf back up to Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Update 3/5: feels like the app only gets worse with updates. the app will randomly freeze and even if i close and open the app up it will not allow me to choose a file and stays on the home screen. sometimes the app won't even open at all and i have to restart my device (it's the app because this does not happen with any of my other apps). lastly, it will freeze on the eraser sometimes and not allow me to write. ive gone back to writing with paper and pencil, it's much better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very useful and I like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Glitchy, shuts down randomly- for an app you pay for, this is outrageous."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Well. The issue Is that i doNot have the pen because i lost it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So much potential! Bug gets a little buggy if I span the app to both screens on my Duo. Won't let me erase anything. Would also be nice if it supported multiple pages with page turning animations so I could use my Duo as a note book."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When are you going to implement infinite vertical length without messing up with the horizontal one? Notability in iPad does this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would be awesome, except I absolutely detest how so many apps are moving to subscriptions. I want to buy the app and not have to add it to my budget every month, indefinitely."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"i have to pay money to get the very thing i wanted and a lot of stuff you have to pay to this app should be a pay app not a montly payment, well this sucks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not useful...😵🤨"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"terrible pen lag with S6 Lite"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Without text option your app is useless to me. It should be for free use. You should earn from adds."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is an absolute must for taking notes on my tablet! Tried out a couple other apps before sticking with Squid. It's like taking notes on paper and I can upload them all so I can pull them up on my phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't interact with PDF at all in the free version. If you are looking for an app to annotate PDFs - this is not for you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app but i wish it had the gestures of the cursive app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, comes in handy to take notes for school, and save money on having to buy notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great. Very help fool for active pen with touch"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay $5 just to markup any documents. Garbage."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing missing is a direct icon for the eraser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty cool app to use if you dont have an apple device to keep notes on. I kinda wish there were more ways to organize it, more ways to highlight/write and maybe some more colors involved would be nice too. You have to pay like 5$ for access to all templets/writing tools which isnt bad. Ummm, I will say, it does crash quite alot. Which is super inconvenient when im in the middle of lecture lol. Aside from that, its pretty cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use tools for hand-written note taking. PDF editing allows imports and mark-ups of pdf files, although this feature requires a one-time payment to unlock. Cannot add additional margins to take more notes on the sides of each page like you can with OneNote pdf imports, but the greater zoom magnification (which also maintains resolution way better than OneNote) and ability to add blank pages at the end compensates for this. Typing notes does require monthly subscription though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"frequent crashes but otherwise a great note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app looks real"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Why is there no dark mode? It's 2022. This is a deal-breaker for me. Also, Why do I have to pay monthly/annually for premium? I should be able to buy the premium version with a one-time fee like your competitors. Two very basic fundamental errors. I'm looking elsewhere."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been great and fun to use! It's so nice, the input methods are great, the fact that the penicl has pressure sensitivity is nice! Samsung Notes is nice but I like being able to feel like I am actually writing on something lol. I paid for the pdf addon or whatever and I don't regret it! 5/5 would get again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's quite alright. Serving the purpose what I need. The way to turn to new page in a document is not so familiar though. It would be great if I could do it in a more simple way ie. swipe left or right in a middle area."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, has become my goto app. Will buy it soon once I get a google play gift card lol. My only nitpick is if it could distinguish between passive stylus and fingers or hand to avoid uninteded marks. Update note: I have an LG Stylo 4 which has a passive stylus. But I did use this app on samsungs note and it has the active pen which prevented unintended marks from hand."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the app and use it frequently but when I put my palm on the screen it messes things up so it's a little hard to write. Do I have to get a special pen for that or what do I do to fix that? I have an acer chromebook."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, I do wish that you can use on multiple devices with the same account, but other than that am excellent note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for making notes, task and journal. I currently use on my fire tablet and wished there was ability to connect account across devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A few suggestions: (1) Making various ""page color"" options available, specially in an era where everyone loves dark theme ; (2) If ""Oblique nib"" pens are made available, then people who don't have pressure sensitive devices will be able to experience ""line variations"" and enjoy this app more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent i was about to buy a separate tablet to write on but this works perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I use it a lot with my Lenovo duet 2 in 1 and a USI pen. The writing is extremely smooth and there are no issues with resting my hand on the screen while I write. Highly recommended."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Intuitive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"i just wanted a huge piece of digital paper to write notes and is easy to scroll about and delete things. This is fantastic, my only issue is that the writing seems to be a bit jittery, could be my pen but i don't get this with other drawing software. FYI i'm using a wacom on a chromebook. It's great for rough work but if the writing was presentable i'd immediately purchase the full version for the text and use it to submit my math assignments"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It is good to my test."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy and well done . Works just like it claimed. Great for notes, writing notes on documents an hilight items."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A must have for school or work! Use it everyday on my Chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad So poor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok, the app is really good itself, it's cute and productive at the same time and also the grids and all the other ""papers"" are really nice touch:) 0 ads either, more bonus points, but, I don't know if it's because I'm using the beta version but.. the stability of the pen is..a bit disappointing (￣ヘ￣;) but other than that, it was perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Free version is great, but $15/year for premium is a steal. Slightly wonky palm rejection on the Lenovo Duet 3. Along with dark mode, I wish there's a way to highlight text like a cursor in addition to the freehand highlight tool, fill a shape with colour, organize PDFs by chapter, and a search function to look for key words."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Screen distorted. I have a picture to share but I can't share here. I cannot see my entire screen. It reminds me of Win 3.1 glitch, from years ago."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! The ability to zoom, pressure sensitivity, infinite scroll, erase using s-pen button, all excellent. Been using for about an year. Haven't found anything better or quite the same. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for. I just wanted to take notes and have them organize so I love the notebooks. There was a little bit of a learning curve, but not bad at all."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's kinda bearable for free, but defineteley not worth the subscription, I had to refund."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is the world best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The reason i dont like squid is because i compare it to noteshelf and bamboo paper. *Bamboo paper app feels cleaner. And pro feature are sold upfront rather than a monthly. *Noteshelf is not as clean as bamboo paper but it stylus is smooth - meaning i dont have to try hard to write nearly its just like pen and paper. And noteshelf is upfront ~$5 and not monthly. * Its difficult to write neatly in squid + pro is a monthly membership"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just beginning."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Just wish you could open two windows because currently im exporting my notes to be able to study off of them!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Looks promising but free version is nothing but a simple sketchpad and most features are behind a subscription paywall. In terms of pricing. It's priced fairly well but I would rather not pay immediately for a premium that I haven't even tried, and I won't go the hassle of refunding just to try some features. So, my recommendation is, is have a trial period 1 week will suffice, 1 month is generosity."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best S pen based app on android. It is simple to use and the features just flow nicely. There is a limited number of pens and highlighters but they have what you need. I love how easy it is to import Pdf abd annotate them. I wish it would be cross compatible with other devices. Overall, I live this app and keep coming back to it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use, great for college students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't type text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is a really great note taking app! i use it to take notes on my chromebook and it's been exactly what i need. the premium version is really cheap which is nice. i only wish there were a few more tools and organization features; a fill tool, a ruler, and different types of lines (like a dotted line) would be nice. also, if you could change the color of different notes or make folders within notebooks that'd make organization easier. but it's a great app, i like it a lot!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Undoubtedly, it is just awesome...But to increase the productivity, it should have single touch toolbar option for direct selection of pen and color, geometric primitives and many more...... It requires multiple touch for the selection of the same so it is little bit time consuming and clumsy ..... So provide shortcut directly in toolbar...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple and effective"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is like the best app it's like good-notes or notability for android but the thing I hate is that it doesn't have dark mode which I only best right it on dark paper, so yeah please add dark mode and dark paper to it and add more pens and pencil or foundation pens like these it would be great ty"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app! I have the premium which is only $1 a month so I never have to worry about expenses. I use it for class and it works great with my Samsung Tablet and S Pen. I give it only 4 stars because I wish it had the option to select certain pages out of the file to export instead of only being able to export the entire thing or one page. That's the only problem I have run into though!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app to help me take notes for school. I wish there were more pens"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"what I dont like is that they're like you can do all this but not you can't. You have to pay first."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for college work where I have to add text to PDFs. It is very simple and intuitive. I would like a few more features, perhaps on the drawing side but this doesn't detract from the fact that this app does exactly what i want it to do, perfectly. It is also very reasonably priced for what it is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for clearing the doubts of the students and to give notes to them as a teacher. It really helps a lot and personally i have suggested to all my colleagues. Amazing feature of all is to erase with one finger and continue writing without having much disturbance in writing. I'm just loving it. To purchase few things inside app,I feel they are too costly. I would have bought them if I need to pay only once. But still I feel it is very comfortable. Thanks for the idea of the creator😍🤩"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would love a companion desktop app to continue editing note or open up shared notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I feel happy to use this app because it's free and more but can you plz update zoom infinitely and add some layer like ibis paint.. plzz😔"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app is so easy to use I love it an there is no ads"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome note-taking app, been using it for all of my college classes. Keeps things organized, I can color code my notes, and occasionally doodle. My only gripe is that I can't make folders for notes, they all just lay on the dashboard. I also wish I could change the color or add a picture to identify notes on the front page, they meld together when they're all blue. Edit: They're super receptive to feedback, requests, and ideas, such great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good but required improvement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ontzettend handig app. Met een stylus pen je heb geen boek nodig."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is paid app. It is critically crippled for free use. Rate is for free features only. Probably better with paid features but there are many other similar apps that do better with paid option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for brainstorming and PDF markups"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good not great. Limited features for shapes and can't change the page colors. Would be nice if it could have an option to auto draw lines straighter."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! I would love a pipette feature though since it would make working with plots/graphs a lot easier as well as other colored displays. Apart from that, dark mode support would be nice, too. Just some suggestions, otherwise no complaints! Simple, no-BS note-taking app, exactly what I've been looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Found this app really useful so far. I can download all of my units and have access to them, highlight, make notes, etc. and view them anywhere as I don't need internet access! Just waiting for a pen to arrive so I can use it to its full potential!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's great... it would be nice to save info in your account in case you are switching phones. So you don't have to input all the info again to new phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I don't have the dexterity to use this app. Doesn't edit text l copy easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's super useful app 👍 love it 🤩"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I personally use this app on my Chromebook and it makes it extremely easy to keep track of all my notes! I highly reccommend it. The free version offers the bare minimum of what you need, and to buy a subscription, the price is very cost friendly and I love it! The only reason why I give the app 4 stars is because I wish there was a popup that asked if you really want to delete a note, because I get so paranoid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only drawing app i will use. This app has helped me design most of the rooms in my house plus redesigning my garden. If I lost this app I would be really stuck. Its easy to use plus accurate and gives you many templates to use while drawing or graph work. It is worth the £6 a year to remove the ads. So I highly recommend this and thank you to the developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app. its good for writing school notes"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Single finger should be for move, not erase. This functionality could be much useful to prevent unwanted lost."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app to use. Would have given 5 stars but backup between multiple devices takes a bit of managing. If this could be improved then it would be 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really helps me with organizing my notes for college. I love that I can upload PDFs. (I paid for premium) This app is awesome!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helps me in my physics teaching class with under gradstudents.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add a switch button between view-only and edit on the top horizontal menu bar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I do enjoy using this app, although I wish it could backup to filesystem so I can use syncthing to move this to my other devices. I'd generally preffer filesystem-like nesting structures for organizing. I think having a tagging feature and metadata export functionality would be really helpful. I don't like the billing model, I'd be fine with buying this for 50€ but 10€ anually feels a bit meh."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I got this app because I dont have access to free printing. The app is nice overall, but I think it's annoying that I can't upload my own PDFs without paying, and that this wasn't more obvious. I assumed the payment was for other features, and had to download another app during a written final last semester just to write in my answers. (i used xodo docs instead if anyone is curious). Otherwise, it is nice for taking your own notes and user friendly, I suggest using pre-sized pages not infinite."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app looked brilliant but .. in order to try the markup a PDF I needed to go to Premium. I am not happy to part with my personal details until I've become ""confident"" with an app (no offence meant it's just me!) One way around this was to use the Chromebook Perk but sadly that is not available in the UK. Very disappointed so I've uninstalled the basic product.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app!!! paid for the premium too :)) aside from note-taking, i also use it for paperless bullet journaling. one thing i wish it could improve on is the addition of more pen options, more fonts (basic serif and typewriter kinds hopefully) and rotation option for pictures. looking forward to the day you add that! (willing to pay a lil bit more for that actually, bc this is really good for going paperless notes and journaling. i dont think any other android app has done that.) thank you!!!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"There should be better palm rejection. As soon as I put down my palm edge on the screen, the page moves and jumps pretty randomly, although I have all single finger input turned off. Very frustrating and annoying. There should also be a possibility to restrict the page infinity to vertical only. Many, many people would need an infinite paper roll. Fewer need an infinite sheet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just paid for and downloaded the app to my new chrome book to edit PDFs and the image is not clear, looks like a poor fax (remember those days) plus, 1/3 of the screen looks like a damaged TV image."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Palm rejection is horrible. Every time I set my palm on the surface to begin to write, the scale starts to shift and the page moves around. Coming from.

What isn't nice Is being told by the tutorial how ""you can use your high lighter or shape tools or pen to draw!"" Only to find out the highlighter and shapes are behind a pay wall I understand paywalls every now and then This doesn't make sense ""You can use this tool.....IF YOU GUVE US MONEY!"" is how it comes off as. I wouldn't mind if I found out there was. A paywall on these but it annoys me that the tutorial makes them seem usable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for writing. Precise and does most of what I need. I just wish it had capability to move writing to text."

However, things didn't go well when I started really using Squid. When I was writing, parts of of text I had written suddenly disappeared. Some features that were shown off in the tutorial were premium, like the highlighter, which I thought was a bit dishonest as I assumed that I would be able to use it because of how the tutorial was set up.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"PDF editing cost extra"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty fuqin Kool app yo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"what a scam asking 4 monthly subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like Squid app, so easy to download PDFs and share, so much you can do whit this app, but, it would be THE PERFECT APP if we were able to zynchronice between devices. I use it on my z fold 3 at work and on my chromebook and it is a bit irritated that I do not have everything in one app, it's like I have two apps at a time. please make that update!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using squid since microsoft stopped updating one note and I regret that I didn't give squid a chance earlier. The free app is great on its own and the subscription has offered everything I need for biochem and physics."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best handwriting app in the market. I wish paste what's on clipboard was enabled so I don't have to save images to inset them. Also, add a ruler and more tip tools for productivity."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid has been an amazing tool to take hand written notes on for my online classes! Squid makes it super easy to annotate pdf files and sharing documents is super easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"$1/mo or $10/yr for keyboard entry? Nope. Wont do it. Maybe perhaps if could buy outright, after verifying can use virtual keyboard AND physical keyboard AND barcode scanner AND voice input. Seemed like it had promise, but have to pass."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it, meets all my needs for tablet note writing and storing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"They are cheaters. Making the app comfortable to the users , then charging for all the backups and exporting s. Instead go for inbuilt note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"If I could rate it 0 star I could! The app isn't free at all, you have to pay money 💰💸 to do anything! Don't think it's free. Don't download it. If you want a free app, NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP! IT ISN'T FREE AT ALL"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall I'm satisfied with the app, but a search function for specific words would make it even better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"NO DARK MODE - WHY??!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Installed & then uninstalled after demo walkthrough & fast user test out. Nice app but not much for free. It should have given full usage for 30 days minimum to create an interest to the searching user. Very professional, but many similar out there giving Squid tight challenges for much less a cost. Moving on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far it has been working great with my tablet and pen. I have almost entirely given up my legal pads and piles of yellow sheets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a writer and the combination of this excellent app with a good stylus on my ancient tablet have allowed me to enjoy an electronic writing experience reminiscent of Moleskine and gel pen. My only suggestion has to do with the occasional annoying tendency for the app to close without explanation - something to do with palm rejection, I'm guessing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for notes and markups. Would be better if only the pages could be scrolled continuously instead of having to use left and right arrows."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app but wish it had a windows version to download."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"this is a good app if i need to write things down but when i get a new note it glices and comes up with a trange picture but i write and it goes. I would like if you could type too if you can then please let me know. i dont want any thing where you need to pay to type insted of drawing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"best among Android apps but lacks Drive backing up, text tools could be better, lacks heading/chapter navigation for PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Features are fine, everything works smoothly. Would have been complete if it had handwriting to text converting feature as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using Squid for a few years. I mostly import pdf forms and use Squid to fill out the information."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall Great App. I wish their was a way to add pictures specifically to the note you page. You can add them, just to a separate page and it takes a little leg work (convert the picture to PDF etc). I also wish there was an option to type some of the notes, because my handwritting can leave something to be desired. It is easy to add powerpoints and note pages. You can create separate folders, which is great for organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is all that I needed for my documents. I can combine various PDFs into one and this works very fast.Amazing app on Android. Thank you so much. One issue is while writing on a page if I swipe my palm the page starts zooming . This make me uncomfortable while writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the app, it's easy to use and there's a lot of great features for note taking and studying. You can upload PDFs to write on and if you like to coordinate your notes there's plenty of colors to choose from. The only issue I have is that the app freezes relatively frequently and I have to force close the app. This is annoying especially while I'm in the middle of taking notes and end up having to rewrite what I already wrote down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the concept of this however it seems with my premium acct., i input pdf files but the whole app closes when I try to go past 5 pages of the pdf. When I click on the page # for example, there would be 12 pages, but the rest of the pages are blank. If there is a support member that can assist me in this I would greatly appreciate it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App to take notes, extra features are worth the price, and I appreciate that you can choose between a subscription and a once off payment, depending on if you want sync features or just the full app. Edit 2: My problem got solved by disabling low latency ink. Can add good customer support to the positives now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There are unnessary of app downloads which I new nothing about. How can I uninstall them?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its a great app for sketching out ideas and taking notes. Very lightweight."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yes Is a good app 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Most of the features requires paid version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I never been so satisfied with any document signing fixing editing or fill in by writing or typing like Squid...thanks so much for this website 😊 ☺ ❤ 💕 💗 💖 😊 ☺ ❤ 💕 💗 💖 😊 ☺ ❤ 💕 💗 💖 😊 ☺ ❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You should try to upload this app for linux"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I started using this app recently....I loved this app....I can take notes without using stylus or pencil easily ...I recommend this app for school and colleges............if we zoom the screen and write we can get the handwritten notes in perfect size....Its super duper good....very nice ...I loved it😎😎😎"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far, so good. Some features should be improved: Scrolling between pages like using a book would be nice..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It needs money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app will not sync across devices. The single most important feature in a productivity app. Biggest let down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app a lot especially for my physics and calculus work, it makes it easy to color code and the graph paper is nice. I kind of wish there was a ruler or protractor function but yeah, all in all, it's a nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Outstanding app that has one fatal flaw. No writing to text recognition. I bought the premium hoping it would be there but no luck so I'll end up cancelling now (Only a £1 month trial) because that's what I need most. A real shame but still a great app if this isn't a major issue for you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I want free tools not premium..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"5stars if can synced between device. Did i missed this feature?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best app I have on my tablets, well worth the money I spend for the annual subscription. I strongly recommend it. Try the free version first, in case."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid as note book, and to keep meeting minutes. Easy to use, incorporation of PDF`s and mark ups on them is super easy. I highly recommend this application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"need dark pages!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No vertical scrolling and when viewing all pages in thumbnail view ,only half page is visible. I found these as cons to this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"At first I thougt I wouldn't find much use of it, but when I first tested it for a couple of minutes, I feel in love with it. It's so easy to use and has useful tools. The premium version is definitly worth the price. I'm looking forward to using it more in the near future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for makes quick notes. I use it everyday, several times a day! Update 11/2021 I'm still using Squid daily 👍🏾👍🏾"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Still great. However, developers never update or add features. Some facial updates happen to appear relevant in the app store. Previous review 2018: Great App. Three (obviouse) features needed to give it 5 stars. (1) Ablity to duplicate pages and notebooks, (2) move pages between notebooks. (3) To backup to Google Drive. For it backs up to Dropbox and Box. Reply for 04/05/21 developer: No Google Drive backup. Only Dropbox and Box. I checked the FAQ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Response to my original review was that this isn't a word processing app and I can unlock the use of my keyboard by paying the. .. HA . This app is bar far the biggest scam I've come across in a very long time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nifty writing app that works fairly well on the Lenovo duet with stylus. Some wonkyness with the palm rejection but that can be solved by locking the page zoom and scroll. A dark mode would be a great addition so I don't have to burn my retinas looking at my notes at night. I would be forever grateful if someone from the dev team could send me a 10% off code so I could drain my google play balance on the advanced tool pack :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even type in the notes without paying for premium. Stupid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent, all you need from tablet notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish there was the ability to have so!e sort of folder structure within main folders. It would help a lot with organization and what not."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this! What's lacking? The page colours! I hope we can see more colours in future update."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing App which I was looking for since long time ago. Squid helps me a lot in reading my books, put comments, highlights and taking notes in meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I've installed this app on a supported Chromebook and I have the subscription, however I've encountered an issue that only this app seems to have. When using my USI stylus, some input lines become jagged. This is incredibly infuriating and it will not go away. I'm considering switching apps since this doesn't happen with any other note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best note taking app for my pixelbook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app in the app store. Totally worth the price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I wish you didn't need to get premium just to import documents & pdf's. Kinda stupid if you ask me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app ever!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I encrypt 🗝️ . No one can read my handwriting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best note taking apps. I know there are many other apps with the same or even better features but they don't suit many devices like my samsung tablet A. I cannot use any app with this kind of awesome features except this one. And even the guide is so easy to understand."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Making notes is so easy that we can read"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I was installed this app for PDF editing, but you are asking for a premium subscription. I uninstalled it, because it's not useful for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"not satisfied when reading the notes. please upgrade with finger gestures to swipe the pages instead of using the 〈〉 icon"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"👎"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app! just what I was looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app, works brilliant on the Lenovo duet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The squid notes better than concepts....so i tried both of them,it fits on my tablet on squid notes but it doesent fit on my tablet in concepts app ^^ Ill go squid notes....then"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It wants five dollars to do what I need. I'm homeless. I'm trying again with LibreOffice instead."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is pretty good for taking notes on. The higlighter tool is a little bit hard to use, but the main problem that I have been having is that the app crashes very often. When I use it in class, I often fall behind due to the app freezing, then crashing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pls give paste option out of premium because without knowing or using how could I subscribe to your app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've only had the app for a few days and so far I'm loving it. Using for bullet journaling and writing family history pages. Love that I can type or write, draw and add images. It's easy to use app and I love the templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Even for adding text through asking subscription better to use other free app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes and reviewing readings for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Vonta record label record"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app but...all premium features ..no free content"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Otimo app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Even the lines are not smooth. Posting from Samsung note s6 lite"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love squid I started using squid when I found this app (squid )on my laptop I opened it it was awesome but I wish whenever I put but palm down it makes a line (. .)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dope!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like the app. Have it set to auto open when I remove my stylus from my Moto 5G. The interface for creating files and viewing the contents is awkward. Too many steps. Drag and drop would be much more efficient and intuitive while using a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No more than five stars possible? This app gets 125! I can write with my finger in colorful fun, and as wide--or narrow--as I like. As a writer, this gives me the freedom to express myself ~ whether high or low, just a list or screaming on the page. With my tablet often at hand, I can take notes at an appointment; for the past 11 months, this has been crucial. My husband had a stroke, so I am his memory. Being able to record notes has been such help! It is my favorite and never lets me down!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app 7 days a week to do timecards,collaborate with customers and office personnel. One little issue that seems to be intermittent is being able to change color of text. I use the app on a note 9 and Chromebook flex-5 and both have this issue,both are subscribed to premium features which is a killer deal for what you get. It would be nice to figure out. -Electrician"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm disappointed. Lines are jagged - there is a feature request for 7 years to fix this. Few tools there and yet you need multiple clicks for tool changing - try draw simple circle/rectangle/line diagram (requested by 600+ users more then one year ago). Blending method of highlighter tool is lowering contrast and readability of highlighted text. In addition text written on a highlighted line is rendered differently. If you move previously written text on a highlighted line, text is still rendered as it would below highlight. There are some interesting features like different paper styles (lines, squares, dots etc), I like workflow based on a vector engine - size changing, colors etc. However I don't understand how application with subscriber model and long history still have so immature feature bugs for such a long time. I'll bee looking for an alternative."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I would only suggest if we can have the pen and highlighter as 2 separate icons on the top panel. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, but there is one thing that i couldn't accept. Google Drive is not an option for sync. I literally need Drive supoort so i didn't upgrade premium. On the other hand, that is the most suitable app for spen. Writing experience is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app ever but if u add dark mode in it then it will be great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Local functionality and usage is wonderful, but the lack of true cloud sync across devices is inexcusable in a paid app. Cloud backup provided is better than nothing, but moving between devices is time consuming and cumbersome if one doesn't wish to lose data."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice app ВUT where is sync between accounts ? I think its crucial to be able to access notes from different devices..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's just the best. Nothing beats squid for Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Гуд"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does one thing and it does it so right. Its simple, clean and intuitive. I've been subscribed for 2 years now. Highly recommend to give it a download."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has been a great addition to my organizational tool kit. Just wish it synced across devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's nice overall. I just have a few quibbles, such as the need to close a page in order to delete it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Only paid works"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for using while teaching. You can use pictures or PDF's and write all over them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"its agood app but some things u should have to be free also eg.PDF converter"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would LOVE to see a dark mode option where the background can be black and the writing white. Great app for what it is though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for using with tablets that include a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't search handwritten notes, no dark mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it and this is excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love squid. I also use x journal or cursive but squid has backup to Google drive with a subscription (I have a subscription for $1 per month thanks to Chromebook perks). the only thing it's missing is to restore backups and sync to my other devices without deleting any of the different notes I've taken on each device. palm rejection and pen side button function could be better/added but I guess that's not squid's fault."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give you 5 stars if it had support for .svg files. It would be really awesome. But other than that, it is a really good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid has been great but could use some upgrades that make more PDF friendly. (editing, manipulating)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why would I pay for features that I can't even try? Ipados is light years ahead with note taking apps..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app 😻💕"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to do what the app says it does. Why not just make it cost $6.99 instead of free?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great. I can keep notes and also draw my ideas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ease of use. The layout is good. Able to put a title to the notes, which is pretty good. Great job guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app but I will be more than happy if the features were free and even those other templates Edit: I am very much happy about the free features but like we can't use the lasso tool and highlighters and lasso tool is something which is my personal favourite but it is not available for free nvm I am increasing the response to 5 star cause still the app is good enough for a high school student like me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dope app Be cool if you guys made Cornell basic college ruled endless Or make it easier to partition the endless pages Also if you could put a view only option on each page made for quality of life purposes going to options for it is unnecessary In my opinion. Or maybe put it where you choose Notes so you don't mistakes and erase with your finger ya know. Also if there could be another eraser option that erases like an actual eraser would be cool For sketches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to use with a lot of fun features the more you dive into it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for handwritten notes!!! Squid works perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy tablets, and its integration with cloud storage services makes it extremely convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for taking notes and I tried lots of team. Everything a student needs is actually free(really appreciate this). The yearly subscription is really cheap, I paid for it just to encourage the development of this great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very nice | use it for school on my galaxy tab S7 FE"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"the pdf import should be free like other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app for note taking. It was the first one I tried so I bounced around to a few other note taking apps, but none of them felt as good as this one. Great job here!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great. I use it mostly for studying. I've downloaded some of my text books and I can open them in squid and write all over the pages. I especially like that I can write with my pen and then erase with my finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! It is Great for EVERYTHING!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bought Office and wished I could manage taking lecture notes with it. Got Squid Pro 15 minutes later and was not disappointed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"die beste"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have many suggestions can make this app more greater please email me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"could use better file management, Palm cancelling isn't always great, overall very useable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"just switched from paper to digital note taking and squid is perfect. I use it for so many things now -- school, bullet journaling, art. it has so many capabilities while still being streamlined. I find other popular note apps to be overwhelming. just wish palm rejection was a bit better - I'm a lefty and often my page scrolls all over the place when I move/replace my writing hand on the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I write math explanations for my students on this app. It's a brilliant replacement for paper when used on a samsung tab s device with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app, have been using for more than one year. But, for an imported pdf document, why is not there an ""add new page"" button with a preferred default format ? It takes several steps to do that each time, if you are not adding the blank page to the end of the document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for chroombook reccomended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Happy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good but it doesn't contain the stylus pen I'm looking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would suggest to a user please buy this app if you want to make notes it is really not that expensive for a year of use. The tranferring of PDF's and the chance to mark things up make it worth the $. Chromebook users yes it works."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Purchased on my phone, but can't use premium features on the tablet without paying again for the same app. Mostly fine app otherwise, but not worth paying twice for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best pen experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It sets black line on black background by default and no clear way to change this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app ever ...!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"1. INTRODUCTION. I am not a bot. This studio is worth believing. 2. CONTENT. This app is awesome and easy to use. Just open the app, create a note and starting taking notes. Easy. 3 step process. 3. CONCLUSION. Who ever reading my ratings must download this app. Its worth downloading. Even if u don't want to take notes, no problem. When u r bored, u can use this app to draw or even just scribble. Thanks STEADFAST INNOVATION, LLC team!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Awesome for note taking of many forms. Would really appreciate a shape drawing tool and better text formatting. That plus an equation editor would make this the best notes app on the playstore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is pretty good but there's one reason I gave it three Stars cause most useful tools that I needed is premium and we need to pay for it ...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't mind paying but I have to try it first in order to know if it fits my need of highlighting from a pdf book. Not even 24 hours free access ? seriously ? How do I fix this issue please ??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Downloading reached only till 83% and did not continue further at all.. Please resolve this issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Epic app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. One thing I wish they would add is a search function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really,This is the best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Hate this subscription model, just give me an option to buy the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am ana artist and in 6th Grade and i think this app is amazing. I have gotton so much school work done in the past week with this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If youre on a Chromebook with Touchscreen and USI pen, look no further than this. I've tested pretty much every app out there and Squid responds the best to USI. it's just as fast and the lines are just as precise as any app on my ipad air. no other app for chromeOS is nearly as good as this one. Well done Squid team"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only reason that I've given the app 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the subscription model. I would be quite happy to pay a one off cost for the app's premium features such as cloud backup between devices and point erasing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I've used it for college over the last few years and it's been amazing. The only downfall is that it's a monthly sub for extras in the app, which doesn't render the app useless. I especially like that there aren't ads. If there were, I wouldn't use this app at all. Edit: I'm upgrading my review to 5⭐, simply due to the fact that the dev responded. Thanks for caring about what the users have to say. Great app, keep it up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love Squid. I've tried a few notebook apps, but this one has the best user experience. The only shortcoming I've found is not being able to group notes within a notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm taking notes for my uni for past few years and I feel comfortable with it. But sometimes more pens or more drawing instruments will be extremely helpful, cause I'm switching app to app to draw smth and then put my pictures in squid back. Also one time purchase option will be good thing to add :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"On the Xiaomi pad 5 pro, this app is great. Even just the free version would've worked perfectly fine but I like some of the features the paid version offers. It's not annoying with ads and it just works. Split screen support is great, and so is palm rejection. Would recommend to anyone that writes in notebooks a lot, especially for school, and is looking to switch to a tablet. EDIT: Pressure sensitivity is fixed on Xiaomi pad 5 pro w/ mi pad stylus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"hands on this app for about a month but decide to not go for it. Overall, the excellence is noticable in its interface and low lag performance that you can use instantly without much learning curve. However, the major issues that discouraged me are ""no option to hide navigation bar"" and ""poor PDF rendering in page flipping"". I thought about sumitting or upvoting on their site, but on that site, I saw many features that should be done being left there for months and even more than a year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't like it this app but I love it so much, easy to handle"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No writable widget"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very responsive with my pen. I love it! it's the closest to writing on paper that I've come across."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"super good. although i personally dont need the other paper types (music sheets, hockey team placement, etc), its nice to have for others. its really REALLY useful, especially for college students. also for doodling, its very simple so you can work very quickly. if you buy the 2 packs (pen pack and the pdf thing?) its so worth it. its a one time purchase and it isnt even that expensive. love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than Samsung Notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app! I'm using it on my Samsung Note phone and the responsiveness and smoothness of writing with the stylus are awesome. Still discovering the capabilities of the software, very pleased so far. Good job devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Mainly need to use this in an infinite size page pen drawing method, like a whiteboard, to make notes and draw ideas, but I found I too often lost position, zooming in out is horrendous, accidently deleted items as I tried to navigate the page... etc etc. I just found using Squid too frustrating. Also I would have liked to have a color palette always on, to quickly change colors directly, without having to tap the color changer icon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is so great for drawing and if you have a stylus this is probably the best app for it. Only thing that doesn't doesn't sit right with me is that you can't rotate any items in the select feature. Even with premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it, very easy to use with multiple templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. It is really nice. This is the greatest note app I'ved used before."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helpfull for meeting note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Butt"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless... All you can do is sketch but no way to write rich text notes... No way to create voice notes, no swipe features, etc... Gimmicky and good for children! Why no way to type normal notes?!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Ok ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I liked it But in everything we have to pay To at least put text for free My whole class download it because our teacher said it but We have to pay for everything my class fellows delete It put I am not so please make text for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App. I love this app. I would prefer to buy the app rather than purchase licence"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cannot import HEIC image. Also, sometimes it does not work smoothly with the share screen function in Zoom conferencing. Squid does not appear or disappeared from the choice for screen sharing. I also have this issue with Google Keep. Squid is better than Google Keep. Squid is easier to recover if the program stops responding. I wish to see more enticing backgrounds available in Squid. Scribble is more colorful. Squid allows my touchscreen to zoom. This is a big deal."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"We need a dark mode for other paper backgrounds (not just the blank page). It may also be modified for other colors as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It is good app to take notes. One benefit is there is no ads in this app. I would give 5 stars for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I recently downloaded this app about a week ago, it is a huge improvement from google notes. Mainly being able to copy/delete lassoed/rectangled text. The draw tools feature is also very helpful. An issue I have is sometimes when I put my arm on to start writing, it scrolls out and pans really far away which can become very annoying. Overall a great note taking app, a few quality of life changes could make this an excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"You all are fighting over dark mode, and here I want light mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works fine for me, thanks for making this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Poor app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this so much that paid for it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good tool for reading and taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using for date book and notes for various things. I'm still adjusting to not using a paper notebook, but I really like this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I am a paying subscriber and I will continue to use it. However, I have been disappointed when I couldn't import my documents to my new device all at once. Edit: After reading the response, and being able to backup (from old) and restore my documents (to new device), I changed my rating to 5 stars. Thank you for the response."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried two other note apps with decent reviews for use with stylus and neither impressed me...mainly due to slow/delayed response from stylus and marks appearing on he page when I rested my hand...No such problem with Squid! The text appears as quick as with pen on paper from my experience so far! It's also simple to use and navigate as a note pad should be...I bought the additional toolkit within an hour or so! Not because I needed desparately BUT it'll be highly useful for work notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app useful when I taking notes in class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app, but not being able to scroll or tap for the next page is frustrating. Especially when I accidentally click on the all pages button when I'm trying to click on the next page button. I saw on your website it has been requested for 4 years now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Problem have been solved....thanks a lot.....such a great app with a really good team...keep up the good work 👏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Execellent software, allows you to write, add images pages, sort and cut and paste. Software has lower overhead, so it works smoothly even for very large files (better than comparable pdf editors)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Neat but missing critical features. No automatic sync to cloud services and only supported services are Box (which nobody has heard of, strange to support this) and Dropbox. Looking for Google Drive or Onedrive. Also, no browser app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works very well, main issue is it doesn't reject palms"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful app. i write my notes and mark my pdf with the help of this app . i have also subscribed premium , so that i can get the complete experience of the app. i use it with my graphic tablet ( xp pen )"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just started using it and already love it!! Even without the premium it's so useful for me!! Would definitely recommend this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app in conjunction with a scanner app, mainly to highlight documents, works well for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs dark mode. Good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have loaded the app and have used it for about an hour. For making basic notes and am quite content with the features it offers for free. The app is smooth. I like how I can classify a group of notes and the premium is also justifiable. The only issue is that of page rendering while zooming out which is pleasantly tolerable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite app. Amazing for school. Subscription price is low- worth the cost."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You can add new page in your daily note book. Easy to write and use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the upgraded version is exactly what i need for college notes. you can draw and type."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"10/10 Great App for all my note taking needs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"easy to use. subscribed for more features. wish you could change the background colour of non blank pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"They need money for PDF... don't download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is good, easy to understand and operate for a old man like me. I am 60yrs old, but adapted to it well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"this app doesn't support multiple touches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app but it is missing 2 features that other writing apps have. The 1st is the ability to erase highligher only (& not just complete stroke as it has now). You have the ability to erase pen on highlight but not reverse. The 2nd is a magnifier that you can use while writing for more detailed work. Overall this is a good app but I find myself using another that has these features. Please add & this app would be top notch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good But Needs left handed mode too easy to exit notes with palm of hand."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use, and excellent UX/UI. I just have a feature request which I find important.. we can't copy parts of a PDF, only what text we wrote over it. copying a selection of a PDF will make it much more useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I purchased premium. I use an active stylus. How do I prevent crazy things from happening because my palm or the sides of my fingers touch the screen as I write?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app so far. I have the premium version and it works great for class. However, does anyone know how to import a powerpoint presentation? My professor uses powerpoint for his lectures and I'd like to make some notes on the slides while in class. I noticed some of my classmates doing it on their ipads. Tried to convert to pdf then upload but some of the presentations are to big. Thoughts?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But when I save it on local dervice in drive it says unabke to open this file..fix that please.By the way the app is amazing,but need a text writer..with keyboard ..non only writing with pencil or finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helpful, very useful for taking notes or drawing quick sketches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, User-friendly, Does What Matters Most Well. From adding text to pdf's to signing docs with my touch screen phone, tablet, & laptop...I just found out I can add images! Very useful for form design I just did for a new job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for variety of purposes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app; I use it to take notes for school, it works perfect with my computer's pen, and it doesn't deprive you of key features like different colors or unlimmited paper, which is definitely a plus. One thing I would love is to be able to make an account without paying for premium, so that I don't have to worry about losing work, but otherwise it's a wonderful app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app lets me write and is very accurate"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Usefully versatile"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super. I am satisfied"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best App For Notes Taking!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App is pretty decent however the palm rejection is non existent. A real shame"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"เป็นไปได้ช่วยเพิ่มปากกา/ดินซอให้สัก 2 - 3 แท่งหน่อยนะครับ เวลาจะใช้อีกแท่ง มันจะได้ไม่ต้องตั้งใหม่ English version Please add more pencils for using, because I doesn't like to setting. Thank you very much I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the writing experience, but I bought the premium version for the purpose of using hyperlinked PDFs and marking them up. However, upon importing, no hyperlinks function in Squid. Are hyperlinks supported by the Squid app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A really very nice app....good for writing notes and etc .....I think that this the best app compared to other app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but would like to be able to change each notebook style/color"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have an issue for updating the app and my payment card not working on your app.it gave me a message your payment method declined."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"SQUID IS AWESOME!! ... HAS GREAT NOTE LAYOUTS, HAS REALLY COOL NOTE STYLES AND LOOKS, AND IT ALSO WORKS WITH MY STYLUS WHICH IS AN ADDED PLUS OR YOU CAN WRITE YOUR NOTES ONSCREEN WITH YOUR FINGER, AND YOU CAN PDF YOUR NOTES AS WELL!! ... I LOVE THIS APP!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app very intuitive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"PDFs suddenly say ""failed to import"" either when I try insert them or open the PDF with Squid. Please fix!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Rất tệ và không tiện"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a good app with essential note making features.I want to bring into cognizance of the developer that the option of 'tags' should be introduced.It falls behind ""evernote' in this regard only ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect tool for me to use with completing reviews with my clients. Allows me to point out the important information and then store it electronically. No more PILES of paper for me to scan in and index later. This apps saves me 5-6 hours a week from ""Busy Work"" that I used to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply awesome app It has made my life very easy. Preparing for UPSC. this app made my revision very effective. Suggesting all to use this app for hadwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I use this app on my Chrombook. I cant seem to get it work with Google Drive tho. I dont mean back up! I mean being able to open the annotated pdf on another device!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its great for my digital paper. I hope the free version would sustain"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I got the app because I needed an easy way to take notes - but after downloading quickly realised how impractical it was. Unless you're willing to go for the paid version, you don't have the option to highlight, erase small parts of, or TYPE text. It's impossible to write neatly enough to be legible, even using a stylus. All in all, really disappointed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for premium and it loads pdfs well, but hyperlinks do not work at all. I was looking for a replacement for noteshelf and this isn't it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredible App for Students that are taking online courses. This app is saving my life lol"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"writing is good, but does not have palm rejection"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I lie the app very much but I think you should put more colour paper like black"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"simply wonderful! crashes sometimes. but saves at every step."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Import PDF not available without upgrade. The description makes it sound like this is part of the basic app but then you find out you have to upgrade in order to import it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Honestly out of all the note taking notes on here. This has got to be one of the best one. Multiple tools, and flexible as well. I haven't had any issues so far. The only thing that it is missing is a palm-reject feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like it very well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great note app. a few tweaks to the paper and finger settings and it is by far the best note app with a stylus.almost no latency when writing compared to other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It was a long search for an app, where I will write lectures and home work. Squid took this place. App almost ideal, but there is crucial feature missing: ability to sync with GOOGLE DRIVE. Hope, it will be released soon, otherwise I will have to drop this app and continue my search."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"First I thought it would not just be a pretty good app but one to be trusted. But then I saw that it actually is powered by uservoice. After reading their terms I deleted the app directly. Although they declare that these are not the terms of Steadfast Innovation LLC it is difficult for a user to believe in that especially while reading through uservoice terms. I'm truly sad about that. Just from a user point of view: really good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greatttt app !! Love it and the price is more cheaper than others note app.. ❤️❤️❤️ very recommend !! And also the method that has been given for paying is very easyyyy ☺️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid can you add features that you can create multiple instance? Samsung Note they can,but still i really like the infinity paper of squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note-taking app. Versatile, easy to use and plenty of download and sharing options. Lots of blank templates too. Even a basketball court!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I have purchased the paid version of this app. However, I immediately felt disappointed because this application did not provide many choices of pen types, such as brush pen, and pencil. The templates provided are also incomplete and less varied, especially for lecture notes. Hopefully in the future, developers can improve the performance of this application by paying attention to some of my complaints. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app just wanted to ask a question , I imported the file then deleted it on my phone but it's saved in squid so does it take my space??"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I haven't used it enough to review it. I am wanting to know if it can be used as a planner with hyperlinks? So far I like everything I have seen but I don't want to buy a digital planner for it, if it won't work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple, easy, fast. handy for notes on pictures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only been using the app 5 minutes best app ever Soley based on the simplicity and the infinite canvass To many apps are so worry about charging you for the ice and the water and the cup that they forget why we are really here"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love using this app more than the s note, been using this for almost 2 years now. But one thing that's holding me back is the non existent dark mode or black background. It has an option for only the blank sheet, but there's no black background color when I change to grid or lined paper. The dark mode is somehow more comforting on the eye. I hope you make one some day. <3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an incredible app. Highly recommended for all students and preachers for note preparation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very intutive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Xcellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The ability to have a bar of favorite pens would make taking notes much faster. Subfolders are also much needed. Other than these two cons the app runs very smoothly and is great for note-taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"helps me taking notes and online class for physics. i would like to see transparency effects."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"TY for the reply, good 2 know there is no account storage. Offline is ok but its not grand for college or work where u need 2 access them on multiple devices. Lot of good options, page sizes + vector are huge plus. Cant delete pages is a big problem I had. The tools w/o subscription are abnormally high ($5 2 import and write on a PDF vs free or $1 in other apps). The brush strokes made with the pen are not always clean or smooth, but jagged and pixelated. OneNote is more versatile."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome, this app is great for teaching online!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There sholud be more pens like..dotted pen..Techno pen..etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this daily to mark up engineering plans. It just works. Nice and simple interface providing the tools I need. Best monthly subscription app I've ever used."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Downloaded it to be able to write on pdf...like is supposed to do..but.... that's a premium feature.. quickly uninstall it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it actually but needs scroll pages (infinite one, not the add pages) overall great experience. Hope you will add thr infinite scroll feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app for hand written notes. The only downside was the text option is locked for premium. I think it should be the highlighter that is locked for paid users. I haven't checked the other features but overall it is a good app for tablet size screens, unfortunately my device has slower response while writing so maybe next time when I have a better phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I use Noteshelf1 every day and I am trying other options like Squid, Noteshel, Ink&Paper... But they are bad ... Sorry"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"👿👿👿😡👿👿😡👿😡👎 unusless I'm very angry with this app wast of time very bad app in my life very bad app pls don't instal this application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app ❤ Easy to use templates, affordable premium functions. Same expression as paper, only better 😀"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The one feature I want it for, drawing on PDF's, is a premium option that you can't test out to make sure it actually works. I've tried 3 other apps and none of them worked so why would I spend money on this if I don't KNOW that it worked."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's just perfect Convenient Different format for writing ✅✅"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can you add free laser pen to it and its ink Vanishes by double touch"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really wanna use and rate it good cuz I've heard the positive feedback .. but I hope developer's guide me in this since I can't even use the app - the download is stuck at 85% for some reason - I even tried restarting my device. I tried and other apps can be downloaded just not this whyy. *Edit: I think the problem is resolved, also thanks for quick reply that time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst Application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"all notes gone... After soending months using the app, opened the app today to find all the notes have been removed follwing an app update, gutted, so muh info now missing.... apprecite it should have ben=en backd up manuaally but in this day and age I had incorrectly assumed it would be safe in the app. will need to cancel the subscription as I cannot trust the app to keep the notes safe. Dissapointed.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"User since Papyrus times The App is amazing and does not fail to impress anyone anywhere. The best possible way to get a paper like writing solution is to have this application installed on a tablet, preferably 12 inches or more, and set up a default page setting of A5. Write in portrait mode and you can write as if you were writing on paper. The norris jumbo is a great writing tool for this. After editing my review to a 1 star, I realised that they offer the ability to import PDF files ....."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Squid is a great app for writing notes and writing on PDFs. However, that's all the app does well, and even that will cost you. There is no organization of notes whatsoever. No search bar, no tags, no folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Junk app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great app for taking notes, but the imported images are blurry, super low res. If you try to crop them in-app, for some reason the image goes back to being high quality, but in the note itself the image is super bad. You can't read text within images because the text shows up as low res nonsense."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I SIMPLY FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS APP after trying it out for a couple of weeks and comparing it with some others. I'm giving it a 5star rating even though I wouldn't mind seeing some additional features (so long as they don't detract anything from the app's already awesome performance and easy-to-use interface) 1.Applying page settings across entire docunent 2.Additional formatting within text boxes 3.Ability to Import backgrounds 4.Image transparency 5.Layers to lock some objects from editing"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a great app that fulfills all my needs actually. I a working as a civil engineer and I need to draw and add pictures on the pdf technical drawings of the buildings, and these thing does an amazing job. Works perfect on Samsung Tab S6 lite.👌"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like squid. Both the pro and normal version provide all the materials that I need when I am taking notes. I really need to know if there is anyway to save the notes on google drive, I have a chromebook pro and everything that I save is on google, recently i lost all my previous notes when my compter was reset to fix some external detils, so please answer this!! thank you for the app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Works fantastic with Samsung Tablet SM-P550 and S Pen. Does not work well with Lenovo USI pen and Lenovo Chromebook Duet. USI pens supposed to have like 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity. Problem faced by most people with Lenovo USI pen & Chromebook duet is, even before pen tip touches the screen, it already leaves ""ink-marks"" on the screen. Writing & drawing is impossible. Not sure where is the problem, Lenovo's USI pen or application not able to handle such high pressure sensitivity."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app got me through nursing school. You can save notes as pdf to Google Drive to categorize or share with others. The super, super low yearly cost is very worth it. The variety of papers and ways to write on those papers, along with the colors and highlighter colors and opacity settings are a dream."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is one of the few third party apps that actually recognizes S Pen and can distinguish finger and pen input. I am willing to pay for the app, but the lack of two functionalities are deal breakers: 1. Use finger to flip page like in every other PDF reader 2. Allow keyboard for flipping page (I use a Bluetooth pedal for flipping music sheets). I have seen these being requested but there is no update. Before the functionalities are there I don't think I'll use it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app to use with a tablet + stylus. I can annotate any documents and sign any forms that come my way. No need of a printer anymore!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great! Nice and simple and for a visual thinker just THE best way to breakdown docs into side-thoughts, sketches, ideas etc. My only suggestions for improvements would be a plugin that might expand the functionality of the painting tools to allow me further range in feeding back to digital art students. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this software just does what I, as an Educator wants to do for my pupils as far as reading a PDF and writing on and explaining on it while casting!

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying this app! I downloaded it in an effort to stay organized at work. I love that I can upload PDFs and edit them. I really like that I can duplicate pages and have an ongoing book of the same PDF. It's nice since I use the same template to take notes. I do wish there was a way to hide or disable the navigation bar when taking notes though. I keep hitting the home and page swap buttons with my hand. Overall though this app is exactly what I need it to be! (I'm using this on a Galaxy Tab S6 Lite w/ S Pen)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used this name long before name change from Papyrus to SQID in 2015, then it was one of very few apps that could enable actual vector drawing on a document (new or existing PDF); still it is best visual markup app for PDFs and great note drawing app (not text taking!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unless you write really large and with the speed of an elderly turtle, it skips letters, pieces of letters, and sometimes entire words. How are you supposed to take notes if it leaves out 3/4 of everything you wrote? Worthless. Uninstalled"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hands down the best interface for taking notes...the 0age creation, and overall interaction with stylus and digital paper. Why 3 stars? No search, and no folder/container structure, and no sync between devices! If you're a casual user, no problem. Heavy daily users will eventually find it increasing difficult to organize and search for notes. Essentially, the problems are crucial for power users."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am so happy that I saw this app from a post in IG. I've been looking for a note taking app for my Android phone (most are for tablet / ipad) that I can use for my digital journaling 💖 so happy that I can use my stylus... I hope there will be an update for changing the font and selection tool for picture to crop / cut. The selection tool is for moving only 😅"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When it will be available for ipados"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I mean the app is okay but it does not provide the BASIC things without the premium membership which sucks, I can't type (add text ) or even highlight my work and to be able to do that i need to pay money which is not really even how much it's worth ... just download something better that does not ask for money to highlight or add a text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"palm rejection is not good..& do give regular updates and new features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A bit of little bugs here and there as any software. The authors keep trying hard to improve it. While overall I find it very convenient for my use, I would love to see more functionalities."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well for showing PDF slides from my android to a projector with attached Chromecast and doing comments, highlights right on the slides +add pages. Great. Some people asking for gestures, it's ok gestures but I should be able to turn them off selectively otherwise start drawing on screen by mistake.. wishlist: typing text doesn't show on Chromecast until I exit the text box. Would be nice show text as I type. Also wish there is a pointer red like laser beam dot. I wish price is ONE time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app, but one feature I'd add is the ability to have folders in notebooks, and a desktop (Windows, Mac and Linux) app that could sync with my tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love this app. The best of all I tried. But! More brushes or some chances for save our color palette would be splendid!!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! It has so many different layouts to choose from (music sheets,Calendar, grid, etc ). I was searching for the equivalent app of Goodnotes5 and Squid surely delivers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No vertical/continuous PDF scrolling = deal breaker. Using the app to take handwritten notes on Samsung TabS7. Love the app, easy to use, one of the best I tried. However, few deal breakers: 1) lack of continuous scrolling in PDF and page notes (why not available in the first place?) 2) cannot reorganized order of pages (and illogical insertion of new page) 3) no gesture based navigation. Critical features if not added, will cancel subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app but almost all note styles are in premium but there's another app where even these are free so it's useless sorry"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really really good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just a rubbish tool that looks great, but hides all features behind a paywall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Wanted an app were I could write/edit pdf. This app looked good but you have to pay to import PDF."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"UPDATE:6-23-21 one year later Still no update to mitigate setting the side of your hand on the tablet screen. The inability to eliminate your hand from interfering with writing pretty much ruins this app. It really does what most people need and the backgrounds are very useful under premium which I haven't bought yet examples AR excellent"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"ফালতু"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but a lot of the crucial features are in premium version. Considering a good chunk of the people are students, its hard to be able to pay 10$ a year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wanted an app that has one-click refresh button and the Squid is the first one I found. It has very convenient ""page turner"" which saves in one note what you write but allows you to start on a clean page with one click. I also have a feature request - please allow the user to move toolbar from bottom of the screen to the top of the screen, under the page-control bar."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid provides many useful functions for taking notes for just $1 each month. I only wish to see the app will supply me with plentiful of colorful and enticing backgrounds for the writing pad. Email the notes to friends will be great. Add LaTex 👍 Filing my notes by dates and access the notes in calendar."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Always the best!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is great and has been extremely helpful in my writing. Only complaint I have is that when I write, I rest my arm down and I keep accidentally backing out of the note or leaving the app completely.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Lacks key features like maintaining subfolders for notebooks Edit: I will revert down unless the Dev's add folders within a reasonable timeframe(3-4 months) Edit: As of more than 6 months the app still lacks multiple subfolders I don't mind waiting for a few more months but the unwillingness shown by the developers to give a timeframe seems unreasonable to me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I had to purchase the PDF addon to test it, since the overall app is so cool, and I wanted to concentrate all my reading in one app, but I was totally disappointed with the PDF feature. You simply cannot turn the pages with gestures of your finger on the sides of the text, you MUST use those little arrows in the upper region of the screen. Usability: ZERO. I'll go back to my Adobe Acrobat Reader... And sorry, but I want my money back..."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Hate subscriptions I saw a review for the fact that I could just pay once, or so I thought. I like paying once even if it is a lot more for 2 reasons... 1) I don't need to worry about forgetting to cancel 2) If I need to cancel a subscription, the features I rely on I can't use. I don't have that issue with paying once."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very help for study and taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice. If they added the traditional left and right margins (Dark red on left & light red on right) to the ruled loose-leaf paper backgrounds and gave the ability to copy or move individual pages from one notebook to another I'd give it 5-1/2 stars. I'd get a more realistic user experience and be able to pair down and organize my notes better."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is very good. Thanks for such a wonderful app. However a little more innovation will add more stars to it. Like adjusting the opacity of image while adding, rotating image at any angle, convert hamdwriting to text, recognition of shape and addition of more pens etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sudenly my premium account is switched to free while my next renewal is next year. Pls do something."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Exceptionally good, but turns sour on Android 11. I used Tasker to get immersive mode on the app so the status bar and navigation bar won't come in the way of writing notes, and thus more screen available to the app. Android 11 has broken immersive mode so I'm asking you to consider adding the feature, as an option, to hide both the navigation and status bars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App immediately crashes when ""share/save to device"" is selected.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally found the app to use for all my pdfs and notes, certificates, etc. At first I wasn't super impressed, but as I learned the interface I realized it is definitely at the head of the pack. I purchased the premium access for pdf importation, and for 7 bucks I think it was absolutely worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't talk much about any app. I love this one and more..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really one of the best app to write on"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A great handwriting application! The UI is simple and clean. I like the options for styles of paper (with the paid version), and when usinfo a stylus to write, you can quickly erase with your finger. I use this daily for work and personal use for a bullet journal. Importing and marking up PDFs is super easy as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's an awesome application...

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Looks good, it's got grid, I like that. What I don't like is that the eraser removes the entire layer not just a piece!! I mean, if you draw a picture or text like an Etch-a-Sketch, then try to erase one part of it, the whole thing is deleted. There's an undo button, but paying for an eraser tool is stupid."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"while I like this app, it takes up A LOT of space."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The reason why it is not a 5 star is that,there is no auto Google drive back up. It would be great if we can flip through pages ,as it's really bothersome to find the arrow to flip the pages. And it takes some time to load the page content as you scroll down, (appears a checkerboard pattern which is really annoying. ). Otherwise it's a great app to use.i love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The functionality of the app is great, and I enjoyed using it. However, unlike OneNote or S Notes, the pen lines are not smooth and as a result the handwriting is becomes really ugly.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works extremely well as a note-taking and drawing app, particularly with a stylus.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used Squid with three tablets, and have been pleased with how it works on all three. I take all my notes on it. I especially appreciate easy it is to export to Evernote, Google Drive, and the like. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very unpolished app. The toolbar has no shortcuts for colors or highlighter. The palm rejection is not good, the pressure sensitivity is too wide range for writing, no folders, no bookmarks, the backups are done in intervals of time (not after every time you close a notebook as in goodnotes), and it doesnt even work properly for me. Only dropbox and box clouds. No audio recording, no dark mode, no vertical scrolling pages, and scrolling inside a page is laggy af. price is 1€/month for all this.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not satisfied with this small things required subscription Ms notes is the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good game"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"👍 good 👉📱"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app full of notes I can write anything out of it by a pencil and I love it because it doesn't have adds and have lots of notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great app, but one major gripe: notes are not loaded as you scroll. There's some checkerboard pattern that is there instead that makes it hard to find something specific on a larger note page. This is the only thing that makes squid worse than onenote. It truly kills the productivity of the app. What's worse is that this has been an issue for years that has been suggested to be fixed since 2014 on their suggestions site. Why is this still a problem almost 7 years later?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It was a good experience to use the app. But i think the fun part is all in the premium package. I would really like to try it, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Writing mathematical notes for lecture presentations. With expansion pack (colors) it's a good balance of simplicity and doing what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app, I am able to download pdfs to teach from and grade tests since we are having to do math on zoom instead of in person."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of my best note taking apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very very useful app for conducting online classes in ZOOM using SQUID."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App has some issues which get me fed up sometimes (("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Just right for me n those needing a handy PDF annotating tool. It would be great if it can be integrated with Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything we need! Keep this focus on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for what you did in the app But I need a ruler , compasses and protractor Please 🙏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best taking notes app!! I just wish it had an windows version, so i can see my notes on my laptop"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great to take note and turn your tablet into a digital notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Although this app in overall is very good and useful . However , you need to update some features like moving pages in a note to change sequence. Also, I am unable to backup my notes on cloud storage. Please give variety of feasible options on cloud storage like google drive too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far, the best note taking app for Android but still incomparable to the Apple apps. I'm using a Tab S7+ and when I use the Lasso it will always select things outside of the selection aswell. The Lasso tool only registers sections as squares, so I have to zoom in in order to select what I want. Also the shapes are pretty annoying to use. You can't select it any other way than using the lasso tool, would be better if I could hold the shape for it to come up with options like samsung notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Squid has many great features-it's very smooth, provides quick shortcuts for changing tools, colors, etc, and has decent customizability in terms of page zoom, template, and pen buttons-but unfortunately there are a few missing parts which are almost dealbreakers for me. First, there's no continuous scroll option, so it's very inconvenient to flip through the pages of a pdf. Second, there is no sync between devices. Finally, the file management system is limited to just notebooks and notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love this app. One of the absolute best from all the other ones I've tried. The only thing that keeps this from a 5-star rating is its inability to sync across multiple divides. You can backup and export, but it's not the same as a simultaneous sync across all devices. If it had this feature, it would be the absolute best on the market!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the app but there are 2 problems 1. The app is crashing roughly every 10 min. So that get to the main menu and have to reopen the page. 2. When I drag the page the parts of the screen that I drag to tack like a sekund to load. It would've way better if the parts off screen would be preloaded so that they don't have to load when I start to drag."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best match for a student, then only downside I found is the absence of Dark Mode, for me it's critical."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is a must-have for chromebook users. Although it's free, you really need to buy the PDF package that's like $5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"V good app. I find it incredibly useful for studying. Not 5 stars cause you have to pay to get full features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great but doesn't sync."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this in university to take notes and Mark up pdfs. Very convient once you hook it up to Dropbox. Sadly those are both premium features . Edit: two years later I am now wishing it could link up to google drive or onedrive. I am starting to run out of room in free dropbox lol.Edit2: Thank you, I didn't even know about the forum or those features. I freed up space, and found out how to export pdfs to Google Drive as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Vewy nice features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pay money save money uninstall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"User friendly essential app! 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using SQUID for more than 3 years now, And it's been a great writing experience all the way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is so useful! I use it to read and do assignments for school. It makes it so that I don't have to print out sheets since I can just write on the PDF through the app. I also use this to keep track of all of my to-do lists and for music sheets. Everything is really easy to use. Would definitely recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best apk ever!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish notes live updated cross device/platform."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than all other notes apps for me. I always try to keep whatever is brought by the unit but always came back to Squid no matter what. Recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is note taking app but this is also the best for sketch, not only that, the stroke coming is really fastest among all sketch-able app even the dedicated art app. It's looks like you guys know how to make ""pro-motion"" like feature without need 120hz screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"its good for simply to do my school work in here:D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Palm rejection is horrible. Had to uninstall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to write on pdf there taking advantage of people who couldn't find other apps but there is now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Achha app hai."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic PDF editor too! Better every release!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"So dissapointed , watheaver comments I made. I went through a google upgrade , the last one on my chromebook, and all important notes had been lost they just dissapear. I Will contact them soon i am just practically ditching this system and return to notability on my old apple iPad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app..love using it. Just a lil expensive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app kicks onenote in the a#$"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente app para hacer ejercicios de matemáticas, creo que debería tener un modo básico para hacer mapas mentales, pero sin que la carguen para que no se ponga lenta, además creo que le hacen falta pinceles para que la letra se estilice un poco cuando uno escribe."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best, most intuitive notes app. A dark mode would make it even better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I keep losing hours worth of notes out of nowhere... At least impliment an autosave feature or something?? I'm so peeved, I can't leave my tablet alone for a minute without coming back to a blank screen? First time I thought that I touched something bad but wow it's just deleting my stuff... My head hurts man.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super helpful, especially filling documents on they fly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I I have a problem with this app it does not support two touch at the same time please fix it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good job. 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app, i like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hi, I just downloaded the app but it doesn't say how much I have to pay. Please advise. Thank you, Evelyn"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"i hate it! i have to pay $5 to import a pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for the odd scribble; I use Squid as a physics student, and it is very handy when I'm using my laptop and going about exam questions (and things of that nature)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy and best app for teaching"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"doesn't let me buy tool pack upgrade"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I am trying this because I got a 2-in-1 chromebook, but it really makes me miss Lecture Notes, which has been my favorite note taking app for years. Good: There is no lag when writing. There are several background patterns to choose from. Cons: The writing often shows as shaky, even though I have a pretty steady hand. I can't seem to get it to ignore my hand resting on the screen when I'm writing with a stylus. I don't understand the scroll. I have now twice lost my notes while writing, because it is set to ""infinite"" page size, and some gesture from my hand caused me to scroll apparently miles away from my writing. If I ""print"" the page, I can see that the writing is still there somewhere, but I cannot find it by zooming and scrolling around. There doesn't seem to be a way to ask for help, only a page for offering suggestions or making feature requests. That's why I'm writing here."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for on-the-go edits to images on my phone. And much more!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"How many times do paying customers have to ask for DARK MODE?!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great product thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But, many things are not available, unless u have premium version!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"هلا ههه عق قع٦٢٦٢٦٦٣عقعهقه"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! Please add manual note ordering feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been using this fir several years. It is simple and just works. Would love to be able to use my own pdf as a template"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful. I've been wanting to have an app like this ever since I started using gadget to write but never found any. So I am very glad I found this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Non premium edition sucks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Generally OK. But for a monthly paid app, I like to criticize on two issues: 1. After importing, all the fillable functions of my fillable pdf files are lost. Is this an unsolvable issue or just a weakness in this app? 2. When in portrait position, the pen/writing control panel is at the lower side and it makes me always accidentally touching it during handwriting, which is very annoying during fast writing. Can it be relocated at the top side like in landscape position? Please fix. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I hope you can put main tools directly on the toolbar so I don`t have to click several times to change tools or thickness."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've tried many note-taking apps. So far, this is a good app to take notes especially with hand writing. I can upload from different sources. I use this a lot for my classes. Just that it doesn't synch with any other device. If I am on the road and I don't have my note, I can't review it from my phone. One feature that is also needed is text search."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app gets 5 stars for me. I got it because we have been using onenote heavily for my online classes and I need visual page breaks sometimes. I love all the features. I got premium which I didn't want at first but now it has made me love it. A suggestion I have is allowing an insert option of a table and to make the typing easier. It seems like it was an added in feature and then just totally forgot about."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very handy and easy to use. So far, so good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect.but i hope it has recorded voice attachment option too🙄😍💙"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I loved this app until right now. After using it for a year and upgrading several features, I installed it on a new tablet. After backing up on the old one with the feature built in to the app, It deleted all my notes! A year's worth of notes are now gone! Not cool! This is a great note taking experience (although it could benefit from goodnote's feature where you write in a box at the bottom and it puts it into the body of the note, even Samsung notes does that now.) but if you lose all your data WHEN TRYING TO BACK IT UP, it is useless!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Good but something is missing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderfor a simple. I am able to easily use it for work, school s, anything inbetween."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a very versatile app. I like the ability to erase with a finger touch and write with a USI stylus. This saves a lot of time. So far my favorite notetaking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This App has potential but weak cloud support makes this a hard pass for me. I suppose if you only intend on using your notes on one device or don't need to sync often it would be ok. The Premium offers some nice templates but realistically, there are simply better options that are either free or similarly priced that include a far more robust cloud storage option. Note taking apps is a fairly crowded market and this app has a very long way to go before it measures up to the marketplace."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take notes for my college classes. It works very well and is simple to learn. I can use cornell notes, graph paper, journal entries, sports strategy displays, trigonometry graphs, and last, but not least, blank pages for doodling. I have tried many apps so far for note-taking and this one has helped a lot. I like how I can input images by my notes to help make studies easier to learn. If I could give this an extra star on account of how much it has helped me, I would."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for sketch and taking note. Have been using it for many many years before it change its name to Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's too good ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost Perfect! They still haven't figured out how to block your palm input while resting on the screen, but it's still the best active pen software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for hand written note. Just loved it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It has some annoying glitches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Love using it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So great to use to take notes!! online school was just made so much easier! And there are so many formats to use! I suggest you get a digital pencil to write and doodle with!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful Application for writing notes. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only time I ever considered buying an app, but the monthly/ yearly payment set me back. Overall, I had a great experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect, but with a persisting issue: near the adges of the screen, the lines are not drawn just under my pen, but slightly above. This doesn't happen with Samsung's built-in Notes, so I guess the problem is not due to a disfunction of my pen/phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not really the notes are bad i thought its was somthing realeted to goodnotes. Sorry..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Works really well with S pen. Would love to see more features (more shapes, math tools etc)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. Two things I wish it had: 1. Search the pdf while editing it. 2. Copy an image from one page and paste it on another. Edit to #2: I cannot copy an image that's embedded in a pdf and transfer that image to a blank page that I added. I have to screenshot the page, save it to my gallery, crop it, and then input it to a blank page. This causes storage issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I absolutely love this App, however, it gets only 4 stars because I’d find it more useful if my notes git synchronized automatically between my phone and my tablet so i could continue working even if I don't have access to my other device. Having to export to Dropbox and then download to my other device is a hassle. Also Google Drive sync would be very useful, not just backup on Dropbox. Overall, great app. Minor cumbersome flaws though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Need more option on how to turn the pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for college notes as imported images and pdf's are kept in high res, this is particularly useful as alternatives like onenote etc reduce the resolution makes viewing Diagrams impossible. . The app also doesn't take up absurd amounts of storage space like others. The subscription cost is cheap and a steal, can see myself using this for a very long time. :) great stuff!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app in all ways with many nice facilities loved this app alot Hope i shouod get this app before"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app Makes complete note as you want.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"..... I just wish I could give this 1000000 star. Only one thing is that if you have an option to use black paper that would be great!!!! Otherwise it is an top notch app. (This app made me un install my original Samsung notes!!!!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless. Paid app EDIT: The only reason I was looking for a new app was because importing a PDF into OneNote is cumbersome. So, I downloaded Squid because it advertises writing on PDFs. Turns out, it's not actually free. You have to pay. Which, fine, that's their right to charge for it - but don't pretend like your app is ""free"" when it's useless without paying. Also, aside from handling PDFs, OneNote absolutely blows Squid out of the water as a note taking app. Way more features - all free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"How can i get squid gift card..where can i purchase that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app on my tab with active pen support for more than a year. And did not search for any alternative. In one word excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really great app! Helps me make notes and plan without wasting so much paper!! 2 negatives that dont make it 5 stars is that you cant change the background colour or the colourscheme of the set notes pages; also I wasnt able to get the premium perk even when I have a chromebook (and yes it was updated too). This was a shame but paying £1 a month is a reasonable price. Im not sure what the limitations were as I got the app with the intention of buying premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Easy to use. Efficient. Doesn't lag. Enough features to edit a book. No ads. 10/10 would recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Well note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great note taking app. missing ability to select and export or copy/paste more than one page at a timem"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unusable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like very much the format and tools I would just add a way to make folders and inside of these several notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome app. I am very pleasant for using it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my favorite note taking app on my Samsung tablet! Erasingwith my finger and highlighting with the button on the S pen makes this a fast note taking experience. I highlight pdfs, work on knitting patterns, do math, take exams, do homework, etc. In this app. I back up to my university box account, and was able to transfer notes from my old tablet to my new one when I upgraded!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's a ok app to make notes with. The pen pressure on this app is not very good the lines always come out squiggle. And you can only use 1 pen and a eraser. Every other pen you need to buy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the probably the perfect and most perfect note taking app ever made for Android. No matter how small your device screen is it can take notes bhai zooming your screen up to 1000%. There is infinite amount of page or also there is page limit. You can add images PDF and so on good luck the developer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good overall, using it for uni. plz have option to disable home button too please."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lots of templates to use to keep notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this with my tablet and s-pen, I could not recommend this combination enough"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"🤟🤟🤟🤟💬💣💣💯💯👀"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good for the free version, but odd that copy and paste is a premium feature. Also cannot enter text via keyboard, only handwriting. I have had trouble changing the zoom level and reverting back to 100% zoom with the double tap. Sometimes changes to huge zoom in or puts me at some other spot on the page. Thought I had lost my work, but it was there. Still, would recommend because of unlimited page size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wrote last review in 2015, when the app was called Papyrus,but I want to rewrite it. For me its the ultimate note taking app, worth paying for. It has everything you would need, its intuitive and belive me Ive triws everything from onenote to write, through bamboo paper. Only thing which is missing is Linux Support. Definitely it would be a game changer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good things: -Vector based and reliable -Export functions are great Things i wish they'd be changed: -No darkmode -Pen is jaggy/not smooth -Title starts with caps for every word -Toolbar is not movable and a bit limited ->Only one pen for writing ->Markers are overlayed onto text not below ->No fully colored forms or triangles -No gestures -Notes overview can't be changed. I prefer folders -Can't sync in a classic way over frew devices (You have to upload an entire backup and download it)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app just want to say that they could make everything free I would give them 5 stars but no , bcz I would like it of they make all the pages free but nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app, USI pen can unlock its full potential with pressure sensitive strokes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Developer's communicative. Great software after unlocking some tools for a few bucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and very handy. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"crashes frequently on Chromebook every 10min"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Govermentive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great and useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"WoW! Super"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect for note taking for blank or pdf, just wish there was an option to import pptx or .doc files as these are commonly used format that teachers give out. Backups have an interval of 6hr minimum which is utterly ridiculous. The efficient, there's a big blue bar on the top and yet all the tools are hidden under a menu, which makes it very difficult to change the color or use another tool swiftly. The selection tool seems to select items that are outside of the drawn section. Not easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a quintessential note taking app for chromebooks. I am using this app as a way to organize and take notes for medical school, so I can confirm it is excellent for students. I do wish, however, that you could save your backup cloud files to Google Drive instead of Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gd app to have but very disappointed after buying pdf import for rs330 and later found mod apk on Google for free but it's not trust worthy to go with mod apk"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good application but all important feature are paid version as like not free And premium version are very expensive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, love using it. I would love to see a feature to fill shapes, since I have to fill them in by hand now. Would already be great if I could fill the predefined shapes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is pretty good at taking notes, but there are some features that you should add: the option to have styles as favorites, synchronization with G Drive, recognition and correction of geometric figures, more creative templates (with decorated frames), sharpen the outline so that it looks a real pen, highlighting behind the writing, format to share and edit the document with a friend, night mode, add bookmarks, more resolution as pdf, save the notes in ""notebooks"" with creative covers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly! The stylus features definitely makes it easier to use. Pro version us very worth it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app. I tried the free version and it has plenty of great tools. I paid for pro and I think its worth the extra features if you use the app often to markup PDFs or take notes. But as I said, the free version alone is great too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for handwritten notes. I wish it had automatic shape recognition for basic shapes like lines, circles, triangles, etc. This is a major feature for any math/engineering students. Eg: draw a rough circle and app automatically converts to perfect circle. PLEASE ADD THIS! **(even if it was a paid add on it would be awesome)**"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Reasonably priced premium and a lot of cool features. Good for note-taking but hangs a lot on the pixelslate/chromebook. Either the Google chromebook team or the app developers need to do a lot of debugging. Can't point at one thing but overall not the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If I was was more tech savvy, the rating would be 5 stars.This app has really helped an old lady like me get organized in my life. Thanks to my precious daughter for introducing and installing it for me.Thank you!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app that allows you to type or write. I like the feature of being able to choose lines or blocks etc. I use it for my digital bullet journal."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app works the best with thinkpad c 13"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Although some tweaks to UI and synchronization would be welcome, Squid is the closest to pen on paper experience on Chrome OS. Great for study as you can use multiple colors in your notes. Infinite pages work well for spacing out notes and for revisions when zoomed out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Must have option for sync between devices... other than that, all is good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it, it's really good when you are on a vacation or even at home, you don't have to carry around 13 notebooks, you can just take your phone ( or whatever device you are using) and write all of your notes. It's especially useful for these times when you have online school. I really like it."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Don't know if this is just me, but there are many times where after writing with the s pen in this app my touchscreen becomes unresponsive for some time unless I lock and unlock my tablet. Only happens in this app and is horribly cumbersome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Boomed I can't use google drive to back up my content. I don't like having my stuff all over the place (different cloud providers). Other than that, the app is good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best notes App. Thanks to Squid I quit using paper 3 years ago. How I found that it is a perfect tool for virtual learning during this pandemic time. Works perfect on the Galaxy Tab A whit S-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Effective"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not having black pages is the only downside."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app replaces high tech instruments which cost about atleast Rs. 7,000"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i like itt very much i can us this when ihave exam or study thanks to SQUID"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm not sure if I've ever used an app that is so useful, with the right amount of features and hardly any noticeable bugs. I use a low cost Android tablet and Squid works amazingly. As a software engineer I'm humbled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"an app I discoved. you can take notes anywhere you are, with different colors to choose, and keep them organize, even draw on your own is also available. this app is very satisfying to use. Im using galaxy tab s lite as device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is good. But it would be great if 1. Add more default pen in tool bar to reduce the process of changing pen's color. 2. Add default line thickness in tool bar so the user do not need to go into the pen menu and slide the thickness which take time and interfere the screen during online teaching. 3. If possible, please create the drawing tools like ruler, triangle ruler and compass as an option to buy. I need it in the drawing class when teach the student how to use these tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An excellent tool for a handheld device. I would've liked to be able to view what I'm doing on my phone synced on a computer screen. Other apps do that with their docs, why not squid? Otherwise an 𝕖𝕩𝕔𝕖𝕝𝕝𝕖𝕟𝕥 pdf editor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Occasional Glitch. Sometimes it glitches on you, but it's decent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I LOVEEEE squid! Its a great app for android users. I use it on my acer chromebook and it works amazingly! The only thing I would say is that all the good features you have to get with premium but it is only £10 a year!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The zooming/sliding feature you do with two fingers is glitchy. I have to wait about 5 seconds or go out of the note and back in for the app to register that I'm trying to zoom in/out or slide the note. Its very disruptive and frustrating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't import any pdf unless you pay. Back to my Samsung Write on PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Why can't I have multiple different pens (style, thickness, colour) in the tool bar at the top? Switching pens takes at least (!) three presses. Makes note taking during calls super inefficient!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use the free version , wish I can scroll the page down, my spen do very well on the app, contrary to Evernote app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best possible notes app I use this app for taking notes on my Samsung Tab S6 lite, I'm in electrical engineering and this app is perfect for notes, assignments, labs. The single only suggestion I could make is add a feature so you can highlight a straight line"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I just have to figure out how to cast onto zoom.works great for my school work haven't used paper in a few weeks. Also the PDF feature is very useful.Loving it! One tip to the dev add a feature to personalize the background into an image of your choosing, giving it more eye candy to the user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its good and all but if u delete the app u cannot get ur notes back or if u delete them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Working great for me so far. Just what I was looking for to start my journal..Also starting to use for work. Good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please add full screen mode. Other than that great app, would be 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An exceptional app which has helped me so much. Not expensive. Easily accessible and versitile!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like this app, but it keeps crashing every 10 minutes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app to use to teach, especially on Zoom"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this APP!!! I LOVE being able to make lists for shopping & to do lists. I also use it to write notes about my patient visits prior to being able to chart them in the computer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't think we should have to pay too upload a pdf plz fix and I will do 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Writing on PDF isn't free its behind a paywall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"writing in this app is an absolute pleasure. The ink is extremely responsive & the tools are highly functional & intuitive without being cumbersome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Now go compete with apps like Nebo that offer a one time purchase but they are way better than Squid. It is also available on Windows so I have an entire workload now.Over the years you have charged subscription for just some templates. I am one of those users who had purchased your tools. When you started subscription, your justification was a joke, now the joke is on you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Advertised features such as eraser type are purchase only. This would not be an issue if they were up front before downloading. They say in the tutorial to test these features out but can't since they are paid features. The free tools are no better than any basic stylus note taking app. 1 star for misleading advertising"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you are looking for a feature rich, reasonably priced free handwriting note taking app which can work with PDF and shapes, then this is the app for you. I purchased the 'Import PDF only' feature, and it let's me edit PDF free-hand. So, this app comes very close to being 'digital paper'. Thanks for not putting exorbitant prices on the purchases."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you thank you thank you 💖🙏🏻"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have saved so much paper and so much time not having to look for something that I wrote down somewhere I know just to write it down in my tablet and it's going to be there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Can you please make it so that we can change the page colour? Like having the page all white hurts my eyes so I would appreciate it if you could allow us to change the page colour to something like black."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"All good except page settings not proper as if my one page is complete then I need to minimize and then zoom to use....Samsung note page settings should implement in squid...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I honestly love this app.... I don't use premium but there are some tricks to use the the premium tools without paging...like for example you can make a straight line by drawing a line then use the lasso tool to make it smaller then it will automatically become straight..... anyways I love that it's free and j can still use my stylus to write on it and it offers lots of backgrounds and colors and they give you an option for multiple notebooks to keep yourself organized love it tots recommend..❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There is room for improvement, however i love this simple and efficient app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app good job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"no puedo hacer nada en la applicasion porque tengo que pargar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Use it with every one of my Samsung Note devices. I have not found a better app to use with my s-pen!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use and has what I need to take notes. Can have ""notebooks"" and move notes around. Also, you can upload pdfs and pictures to your notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I wish the tools for shapes were better. I also would love a ruler feature and the ability to mark pages side by side."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for writing notes in any language"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The most functional app for note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use the app to replace blackboard while giving math lectures at a university (over Zoom). I typically create partially filled pdf slides and then write on them while lecturing, using a 10.5 inch android tablet with pen. Three things would vastly improve the app for me: 1) while the pen is hovering over the screen, there is a tiny circle. However, it's so small that the student's can barely see it. I don't know if this is something that can be done inside the app, but I would love if I could change the way this circle looks and use it as a pointer. 2) The blue bar on top takes up about 20% of the screen while not containing anything too useful. The app looks like it thinks that my screen is much smaller than it actually is. The bar doesn't go away when my tablet is connected over Zoom and I am sharing its screen. 3) I change colors often. I like the preselected colors and appreciate that it takes only 3 taps to change color (unlike other apps), but I would appreciate if the (much thinner version of) the blue bar on top had a few color disks to choose from (of colors customizable by the user) and color change would take one tap, not 3. 4) The last complaint is just a minor one, but maybe easily fixable: when I write on my slides (created with beamer, LaTeX, of standard size) and I want to add a page, I struggle to find the correct size to match the other pages. As a result, the resulting class notes have pages that are suddenly twice as big, or the pen becomes too thin, etc... Otherwise, great job, this is a very nice app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it everyday absolutely love it! Only exception is it needs a save/ edit options. As it is if you accidentally swipe across the screen with hand or finger you erase portions of drawing. That's a problem. Please fix this problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"•I just don't like that to insert a pdf u have to pay • Also everything is Premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it:)))"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, I like almost everything about it. The only thing that I don't like is sometimes when I select something that I wrote with a weird shape, it doesn't select the right things."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"To import a PDF I need to buy your lousy app? Y'all suck."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A student's dream. If you are in college, you need this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome app , wish the premium was a one time payment instead of monthly subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good draw note,. But I wish you could use text aswell. Good app overall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good for taking notes, or for studying pdf files,with the ability to highlight, underline or just draw all over it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have been using NoteShelf since Aug 2020. I use note writing apps a lot for studying AI and stats (a lot of equations, diagrams and images) so it is an absolute critical piece of software, besides having decent hardware (Tab S7). After all these months, I finally decided to make the jump over to Squid. Bought the in-app tool pack, backup and PDF import.The overall experience have been great thus far. #################################### PLUS:: [ Palm rejection is MUCH MUCH better on Squid than on NoteShelf. I think it might be due to Squid requiring 2 fingers for pan. This was a MAJOR PITA for me using NoteShelf. ] - [ My backup EMR pen from my Likebook Muses worked way better than on NoteShelf. Even the eraser works on Squid, which doesn't work on NoteShelf. ] - [ I screenshot a lot (off lecture videos) for my notes. On Noteshelf, my palm kept accidentally selecting my screenshot-images because the app registered it as a long press. On Squid, selection of images requires the use of the lasso tool, so no such problem. ] - [ Pressure sensitivity works well. Makes my handwriting look a lot better. ] - [ Squid's shape tool is a lot more use-able compared to Noteshelf. I can be very precise. ] - [ I exported my NoteShelf notes as PDFs. Squid opened them up like a charm. ] - [ If we put font choice aside, typing text with a bluetooth keyboard is a lot less buggy on Squid vis-a-vis NoteShelf. ] - [ 1000% zoom. I can pack a lot into an A4 sheet. Especially useful when writing cheat-sheets. ] - [ There is backup to a local folder. This plays well for me as I have FolderSync Pro. No such feature on NoteShelf. ] - [ I can set what action to take when I press my S-pen button. No such setting on NoteShelf. ] ####################### CONS:: [ Eraser size needs improving. The smallest setting (1mm) is still too big when you zoom in to 600%-1000%. Only way to work around is to not write at such high zoom levels. ] - [ Eraser shape is square. NoteShelf is circle, a shape that is a lot easier to get into the little nooks and crannies, especially on a page pack full of notes ] - [ One extra tap to switch out to other tools (i.e. lasso, highlight or shape tool.) ] - [ Lasso selection can be a bit tricky if handwriting and image are too close. Noteshelf doesn't have this issue: I usually just draw a small lasso circle in the middle of the image to avoid all the handwrite all around. ] - [ Not sure if the automated backup is actually working *Testing in progress ] - [ Cloud backup ONLY has Dropbox and Box. No Google Drive. NoteShelf has Drive, Evernote and Dropbox. ] - [ Whenever you zoom, the zoom % box (that lets you know what percentage zoom you're at and to lock it if you wish) is right smack in the center-top. Very irritating when you're trying to write from top-down. With NoteShelf, I was at least able to drag it into the corner. This box should really default to a corner. ] - [ No audio record. Noteshelf has it. ] - [ Access to other page templates requires a monthly subscription on Squid. Noteshelf's page templates are free. With PDF import, this is easy to go around on Squid: I just export as PDF from NoteShelf's template and use it as and when when on Squid. ] - [ No bookmarking. Noteshelf has it. ]"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! I use it daily. Easy to use and works well for handwriting and marking up PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best note taking app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! Great app to draw and take notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app in note taking zoner.It contains almost every thing we need. Still it needs some update like -need more erasers, need highlighter etc in free version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using squid for measuring and ordering materials on site as a carpenter for over a year now. Love the app! Just wish it could be used on apple devices aswell."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"If only there was a dark background option this would be five stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool that I use for alot of my schoolwork and doodles. I sincerely hope that the free version of the app doesn't have any intrusive ads (banners would be fine by me) in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app is unfortunately lagging behind competitors. The free app is good value but for the subscription it charges it still does not have labels, only folders, there is no OCR and there is no search in the app. Very dissapointing since this was one of the better Android note taking apps early on"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very functional"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So Far it has been great the only complaint I have is I wish there was a Folder system inside each Notebook. For school it's nice to have one notebook for a subject and then have a folder for homework and a separate folder for lecture notes. Both being inside the same notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works really nice. I found the perfect app for taking school notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've never had a digital notebook that I've really liked. Squid is amazing. It's got the feel of a physical notebook with all the perks of a word processor / note taking app. The ability to move pages & reorganize is great. If you have a decent device with a stylus, it really shines as a sketch, or ""bullet,"" notebook. I use it for organizing creative ideas, my personal diary, & taking practical notes like shopping / to do lists... affordable subscription is also worth every penny."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would it be possible to add dark mode?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note making on Android phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I subscribed once, but stopped subscribing due to financial reason. It is simple and easy to use, I really like it but for me the price is a bit expensive in MYR. We can't even use highlighter on the free version. Maybe will keep on using the free version on note taking since I'm trying to go paperless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"excellent it's pretty much everything I've needed it for I just wish there was an option to rotate pages if needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good for a free app been using it for 5months now for a tablet and it has a premium version aswell which i am thinking to buy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There may be others with more features but this has exactly the features that I need, and a little bit more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"this is by far my favorite note-taking app, but the lack of syncing/backup is a big downside (lose your device, lose your notes)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple and elegant, better than onenote. Downside is it has too little feature when using free version. Would like to suggest 1. Multiple color pens on the menu bar itself rather then selecting color everytime. 2. Pdf insertion support should be free. 3. Full screen mode. 4. Ruler, compass and protector support; different shape drawing support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really simple easy app that does most of what I want it too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I like the interface. It allows folders like Evernote. I pay premium for Evernote but am upset because I use it heavily and have troubles printing consistently. Squid appears to have a print option but wont let me do a text note unless I pay premium before trying to make sure it is going to work for my situation and not a perfect scenario that you present. If it will work for my situation then I am in the market to dump Evernote. But I am also upset with apps forcing me to pay before trying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app, it's the best thing that I've done to help me with schoo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Responsive and easy to use woud be useful to directly import PPT files as well as PDF. Overall excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best ever..... Thank you squid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Clickbait. This isn't free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to create note template. But other than that it is perfect for schoolwork."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesom app now I can throw away my old pen and paper. keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I hope you update the text and put the basic ms word fonts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using squid since before it's name change. I use it enough to pay for the extra items, but not the premium monthly sub. Flows well and no issues. Easy to organize. Use it on galaxy tabs with s-pen. Works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gigantic help all throughout college. Minimised the amount of notebooks in my bag and the premium is definitely worth it. And while I'm not currently using it right now, it's gonna be the first app I download if I ever need anything like this again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIS APP. This app is an app I depend on. I've had this app for years. I'm able to hand write or text type,I can add notes, make several pages on one subject, edit , add pictures and write on top of exported pictures and notes ..easy file making and filing of notes......I use this for everything!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's a bit glitchy when dragging the page. It bounces all over the place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for students! I use Squid (premium) for taking notes and mark up PDFs. Super easy and intuitive! It's the best app I've found so far and the price is okay (though I'd prefer a one-time purchase, but I understand that a monthly subscription is much easier for the developers). There's only one big thing missing: real-time sync (or at least a backup function) with OneDrive and Google drive. I'm pretty sure they're working on it already and I'm desperately looking forward to it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and responsive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this app for all my school notes and it works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It was working great but then it stopped suddenly when I had to do an important assignment. Betrayed by trust!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Too..... good application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for PDF markup"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I was so hopeful. I want to write and save on PDFs for my work. I go through a lot of paper, and I was hopeful this was going to work. Often, it did not read the stylus well but that was not a deal breaker. It just kept crashing. It kept closing the form I was writing on repeatedly. This is problematic cuz I take notes while talking to a client. I had to use good old fashioned pen and paper which really defeats the purpose of having this app at all! I am very very disappointed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love squid, it is my primary app for school. But there are some suggestions I would like to make to make this app better. 1. Let us have multiple pen/ highlighter presets like in OneNote where there are 4 favourite pens and 2 favourite highlighters. It makes it very convenient to switch between them. 2. Allow copy and paste select pages between different documents. Right now you can only duplicate whole documents and pages within the same doc. 3. Finger drag to select pages in thumbnail mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app to use a stylus on chromebooks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So far it's the best writing experience for the Lenovo Duet. A few tweaks and added functionality, and it could be he best experience for any tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app for studing but it miss some features like scrolling pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app ever. Worths the subscription!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love it! I use it for my daily journaling. It is very responsive. as an enhancement, I would disable/hide the tablet navigation buttons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use galaxy tab s6 lite. I love using squid. I use it in as my note for my student. Squid help me much in online teaching these days."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, but I would love it for it to have a better palm rejection software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has flaws, but is over all the best writing app I've experienced"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for taking notes. I'd propose more drawing features (perfect circles, triangles and measuring tool). Solid performance on my lenovo tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! But needs more extra TOOLS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best all-around drawing app that I have found for my Galaxy Note & pen. Sketch, shapes, erasers, various backgrounds, full copy/paste/duplicate. Definitely worth the small monthly fee. Looking forward to more features, like snap-to & drag-alignment."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be perfect with handwriting recognition"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app keeps saying I need to upgrade, even though I am already subscribed. I have to uninstall and reinstall for it to fix itself. As a result, I found out that it also want backing up my notes even though I had it set for daily backup. Once I uninstalled, I lost a half semester worth of notes and have no way of getting them back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"✌✌✌✌✌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice, sangat fungsional"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"You need to more features and different pen styles"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for students for notetaking and past paper doing. However I'd like to give some suggestions to the developers. Firstly it is to give the ability to create folders within notebooks for futher organization. Secondly it is to allow us to crop the pages we want to export. Currently we can only either export the whole thing or export only one page. Also extra thing that probably won't ever exist but a desktop app with an account system would be phenomenal. Thanks for reading so longlmao"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For the most part, Squid does exactly what I need it to do in regards to PDF markup and note taking. However, on a regular basis the current note will become unresponsive and I have to back out to the note selection and reopen it. Also, when using a pen as input, Squid sometimes will not ""write"" until seconds later. I do want to say, though, I do enjoy using this app on my PixelBook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid provides me a quick convenient way to take notes. The option to write the note vs. type is nice to have. I reccomend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easily one of the best note taking apps on android, one thing that would make it better would be to be able to save pen settings (colour, thickness etc.) and switch between them on the navigation bar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best for chromebook duet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good, very affordable if you just get the additional pacts as opposed to a monthly subscription. It does everything I need in a note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I purchased the import pdf feature and my money got deducted but I didn't get the feature in the app. Rectify the error"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"after the latest update, my premium tools are gone and I cannot restore purchases. pls help. thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a really great app it alows you to choose from many different types of papers like grid and lined which I find really helpful. I love how you can move, resize and change the color of something after. You can also change the color of the paper to cream or black. I 100% reccommend trying this app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App seems half decent at first, but when you use it you realize how bare bones & stripped back it is. There's a few free templates, one plain pen style, some colors, and ink thickness. That's about it. Want to change basically anything else? Gimme money! Paid apps are completely fine - what makes this deserve -1 star, is you don't actually buy or own the app. You *rent* it. Monthly, or yearly. Greedy, greedy garbage move. Use literally anything else. It's not even good lol"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's amazing. I've been looking for an android version of iOS GoodNotes for ages now. Squid isn't exact, but it's pretty dang close. It's user friendly, visually pleasing, and has a lot of great tools. Now, most of it requires premium, but it's so super cheap. Well worth the $10/year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So very much app!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is a good app for taking notes, as it provides numerous ways to do so. The only complaint I have is that when much is written on one page, the process of opening that note page is long and sometimes the app crashes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ever better than samsung notes on samsung s6 lite"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"i do enjoy using this app. it's simple to use. however, please fix the lasso tool, maybe more type of papers, allow me to export multiple pages (not all) and add more shapes. as a maths student, i sometime need to draw shapes like paraboloid. will be great if you add it. thank you so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Upgrading to 5*. The backup & restore feature is exactly what I needed. Thanks for your response. I love this app! Great note taking app. Beats OneNote for Android. Imports pdf files beautifully. I use it on a galaxy tab s6. Several reasons it is not 5 stars. It does not automatically save to the cloud. You have to export it to save it or view it on other devices. Also, it doesn't sync across my android devices even though I have a Squid account. No version for pc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It lags a lot, it can be annoying but it's the only app that I've tried that has helped me take notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Does not lag when writing with a stylus. Feels very natural"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perhaps the best note taking across all platforms. Simple and straight to the point. I use it as a tutor in a variety of ways. Support for pdf is amazing. You can open your pdf files and jot down notes as you please. The tools at your disposal will allow you to create any illustration you like. It would be niecer if they included additional custom shapes in further development. Kudos!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm using it over two years on the premium version and I'm pretty happy with it but there is a major feature that I really want is that I can combine different notes under one subject I would find this very helpful because I find it really hard to keep your order after you taking notes as a student"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I have actively searched for alternatives but Squid comes out on top every time. I have been using squid for almost two years now in college However, If I would suggest any improvements: - Continuous scrolling through pages - An alternate view to see two pages at once - Colour coding notebooks - Dark mode for the app Otherwise, I love the app and would highly recommend to anyone. You will not find anything better. Trust ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"As someone coming from an iPad to a Tab S7+, Squid is a great alternative to notability, arguably the best note taking app on iPad. Squid is very responsive and the writing comes out clean. I like the organization options and having it as a PDF editor is great too. I have to take massive points off for one single thing that is such a downer that it frustrates me on an otherwise great app. This app, a note taking app, is not in fullscreen mode. That's right. The navigation bar is there at all times. It's incredibly frustrating to accidentally hit any of the buttons on the navigation bar which I have already done plenty of times in my first day using this app. An option for fullscreen mode would make this app so much better. As is, the navigation bar being there is massive points off and, maybe over time, a deal breaker. For now, I've resorted to using a fullscreen immersive app that forces the device to have it in fullscreen mode at all times when activated. A workaround, but not a solution."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can we use it for drawing???"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Great app, but SUBSCRIPTION?! seriously? In the middle of a pandemic with job uncertainty and other concerns? One off payment I would consider but not £10pcm can't afford it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great no frills pen App.Better than apps that try to make text and diagrams.Easier access to different pen settings would be good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Updating my initial 2 starts review. Since I've gotten my stylus I haven't had any more stability issues. The only feature I'm missing now is the availability to switch between different drawing modes (pencil, marker, straight line...) quicker."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"still waiting .Please include rotation of selected text and predefined colour, pen size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I use it to take all of my notes for school. One thing I absolutely need from this app is the ability to sync notes from one device to another. That would be so helpful!! Other than that, it is a great app. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"i personally think squid is unorganized. But im still installing it because samsung notes is currently not working on my phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Literally all the good things are premium and I wanted a free app I could use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only reason I haven't put a 5 is because of the Palm rejection. But not sure if not is the app or tablet. Once that is sorted it is an easy 5!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app it is so helpful. It is great for taking class notes. Love the different gestures that you can customize and that it is compatible with the S pen"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"best quality when I safe the file as pdf its not heavy, maximam 1mb unlike S notes which reach up to 10 MB per file although i didn't add pictures I would give for now 4 but going differently for the 5th one when more writing pens can be add different types as the one available for S notes overall great great app used it for studying and work and highly recommending it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for the most part but it could add a few features, for one on Noteshelf you're able to have a floating tab of favourite pens, secondly on Nebo you can implement diagrams and it recognises hand written notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app for note taking however I do wish there was more pen and font options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I have known. I am a student and I can study more effectively and easily. Thought I would ask you to add stickers too. Overall this is very good app whoever is reading this review plz download this app this is very useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app.. but subscription is bad.. there should be one time payment and not monthly or yearly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It does it's job of taking notes but does not have palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It is an ok app the thing wrong with it is you have to pay and paying for an app when you a poor student is the last thing you want to do but I guess it is a pretty good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Should be zero stars. Don't hide the tools under a menu. Choosing between pen and eraser and some basic colors should be right on a bar for a single touch. Complete waste of time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a great app if you don't want to be using a ton of paper to writing things down and while you'll definetly need a stylus to use it well it does a great job being, well digital scrap paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You can't use it if you didn't pay, it would be better if you have the option to try it first and pay it for more if it works for you, but the high price and the doubt if it works fine for me makes this useless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helps. In taking notes properly for free will definitely recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app. Easy to use. Good features. I'm hoping for a version for Microsoft and synchronization across platforms."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"4/5 it's a good application, but I would have given 5/5 if it had more types of pencils (ex caligraphy). Despite that, I have The pro version and I don't regret it!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great. Have been using it to record notes across various projects for about a week now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is great! I'm a Teacher (HS Physics), and I've used it extensively, both in the classroom and for distance learning. It's not an art app, so it doesn't have all the graphics features for painting and layers, but as a result the interface is very small, leaving maximum area for working. The feature I most wish for is a fill or area paint, but that`s evidently a technical limitation of the vector format. The stylus integration is nice, making great use of the S-Pen side button."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is hands down the absolute best tool for digital pen notes."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Versatile,"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its ridiculous that doesnt have dark mode, and its the only app that cut the image whenever you resize the page, awful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add Zoom box or zoom in writing window feature similar to Metamoji notes or INKredible or FiiNotes. It is very useful feature for writing on smaller devices like note series. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I purchased the premium version, 1 year subscription, so that I could annotate and highlight pdfs etc for my studies but the selection tool doesn't work for the pdf documents I have imported which is a major downside because I can't copy or select the text I'd want to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have used samsung notes before this, that is easy and has so many options unlike this waste app which asks to buy every small feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's really cool app for notes but tho If it free wil be very nice And I want to highlight And the brush is very ugly Hope u update this app :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Despite the score I gave I really think this app has so much potential. If there was a zoom window for the writing (think notability on apple) and hand rejection I'd be willing to give this a higher score."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like this app. I even purchased the import pdf function. However I cannot get the pdf page links to work with my digital planner like I can with xodo reader This is unfortunate because I like this app much better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It is okay. First of all you should add different types of stylus options. Secondly, the handwritting or you call call it as smoothness of the written text is really bad. Thirdly, the response while using the stylus should be improved Forthly, please add more page designs one with the page borders on both side of the page would be the best for us students I will rate 5 stars if this is implemented"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb apk"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app but without integration of onedrive usless for me ... Also i don t like abos even if the price looks fair"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does a great job. Notes with drawings and annotate PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Missing tags, would be great if you add this tool to find notices easier"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Poorly built, overhyped app. The app's infinite scroll feature is built so poorly that even with my SPen and palm rejection enabled the page keeps scrolling in all directions and my notes often disappear. I finally switched to another app that does the job well, and now I can seriously focus on study and taking notes instead of fixing things at the cost of my precious time. If anyone wants to try this app, it's ok, just don't spend money for buying its useless features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why do I need to pay monthly for importing pdf, lame payment model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very promising but needs Dark mode Edit: thanks for reply, I see it Now! Def 5 Stars now, but I suggest to make it make it more intuitive as finding that option was impossible W/O your reply . Additionaly would be nice to see an actual dark mode + dark background to other paper types, nonetheless terrific Job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can you add the eraser tool next to the undo/redo arrows, please? Using the finger as an eraser accidentally erasers notes while scrolling pages vertically or horizontally. Having the eraser tool inside all the other tools gets annoying when trying to take notes while the finger eraser tool is turned off. It's time-consuming when trying to switch between the pen tool and the eraser tool. Please add the eraser tool next to the undo/redo arrow buttons. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Writing experience is very good . But Some features should be added - 1. Rotation of shapes [Badly Need ] * * * * 2.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has become my go-to app for notes and idea sketches. I even use it when I don't really need to because I enjoy using it. I recently purchased the PDF mark-up tool which is much easier to use on my pixelbook than the default markup tools in Reader. There are some features I would like to see added such as constraining line angles, paste in same position as an alternative to in centre and/or an extra layer I can draw/write on in the same page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Main reason I got it was to mark up pdfs, but that's a paid feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had tested it on a Teclast P98 4G and I was impressed. I had tried several other similar products with unsatisfactory results. Squid impressed me directly. I have worked with it on a Chuwi and on a Galaxy S6 and I am impressed! A few wishes: Page bookmarks(!!), flip pages forward or backward by hand gestures, and go to a page by just typing it's number! Should not be difficult to add these features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Could u please add a text-based search button through pages rather than browsing through all pages? It will be much easier for us to reach to the required page in case we opened a large file."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dear Squid team. Thanks for amazing work. Can you please add ruler function next time? So like while we want to use highlighter ruler is needed for it to be straight. It would be a good addition. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pdf easy and make your own note planner etc. Fully capable Voice to Text for note taking. Open my PDF magazines from email and keeps me on the right page. Export your old notes. I was looking for a planner nothing was satisfying me, so now I make my own PDF pages load them in and use them how I want with full notes. Export them and remove them once I'm done with that month. Only thing that would make this better is either the ability to link or talk to my Google Calendar."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app for typing notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After using this for months during my online school, it's been great.There is a notebook feature so you can separate your notes for different subjects. I have no idea if it has a limit, right now I have 10 notebooks. You can also separate your notes into sections. For example in my math notebook I have a unit 1,2, and 3 to be more organized. I'm really happy used this app, oh you can also add pictures for free. I'm looking forward to using this app again for my 2nd semester. Best note taking app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great note taking app and I would suggest only minor updates. The lasso tool could be improved to only lasso what it is drown around so edits could be made easier just some improvements. Another thing is the sorting folders should be able to have folders within that category. For ex, I have a school folder, and I wish I could add folders in that category to sort my classes. Other wise this is a great app and updates should be minor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great product for online teaching!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. I'm working on my house design and using it for adding my remarks and coments to the blueprints. Can you add layers and editing of inserted photos afterwards - move, resize...?"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Some idiosyncracies but generally a good program. Subscription model is not worth it and only get 3 stars because of the obvious money grab. i paid the one time fee to unlock components, much more feasible for what you receive. Charge more for the full program would be appropriate, but there is no compelling reason for a subscription with a note taking program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best note taking apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very basic and minimal app. I would call it a notepad or post-it style app, rather than an app for taking notes. It's the kind of thing that works great for marking up PDFs and drawing on things. Great for visual thinkers. But for taking notes? Nope. The main missing features that I need in my ""note-taking"" app include: Tables A formatting bar like on OneNote/EverNote Being able to link one page to another"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Are there any developer's working on this app anymore? I'm looking for a rotate option (once uploaded you're stuck with the orientation) i get that if you insert a picture, that can be rotated, but an entire page cannot. Again, wishing for sub folders especially as the term is changing, I'm continuing in a series of courses, I'd love to have the subject as the main folder with terms as differing folders. Color filters.. a few simple things that can be done in an update, really."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much for this! This was a great alternative for goodnotes5. IT was expensive so i just download this app and this is really coooll thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its very helpful. From notes to graphs, everything is good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it very much. It's really useful to me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using Squid every day for two different classes, so about 6 months total, and it's really a great app. I can only really think of some minor suggestions for improvement, such as sync across devices, and the ability to add to remove elements after selecting them with the selection tool. And it would be nice to have the ability to lock some items in place, so they don't get moved or selected accidentally later. I often make tables and being the force them into the background after drawing them, similar to how an imported PDF functions, would be nice. That's about all I can think of for now. But this app is so much better than all the others I've looked it, it's hard to complain too much. I especially like how it works so well with my S Pen to suppress any contact my hand makes from disturbing my canvas."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just love the app even though Ive only written one page I really recommend it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything is great... Just improve the polygon tool and add a pointer(or laser pointer) tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is a ultimate app. There is no bugs. Thanks a lot for the owner"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just started using this app and I like that it is straightforward and allows me to just take notes. The two-star deduction is because the cloud backup choice is so limited. I prefer to use OneDrive for everything. Not having that choice is a real problem. A YEAR LATER. You haven't done anything about a different cloud backup. I One Drive and the Samsung cloud. I'm going to have to figure something else out. NOTE Developer responded impressively!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, I use this for notes for school! It's kind of like apples note, only if you want an experience for Apple notes if you have Android, but I do recommend for school use :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Devs.....Please add dark UI. Excellent app for note taking BTW."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"really good! wish there was password protection or more brush options but it does the basics well :-)"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best digital notebook for handwritten notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for designing new things and making notes. Lots of different uses and can up load photos ect to design. I have a note 10 and it works perfectly with the s-pen. Only drama i have is the lack of ability to add a text format to your notes, you have to write it only, which isn't always what I personnaly want. Other than that small issue, ill happily pay £10 a year for the pro features. Its a well designed app, that I use day to day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Don't want to pay in order to upload a photo. I'll find another app that doesn't charge"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good and usefull, and some more selection for types of pen would be better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the work that the developers have done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like using Squid for school! I recently bought a tablet with a pen and this app is a game changer. The PDF markup works great and premium is well-priced. I'd highly reccomend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love the writing itself, I'd like it more if it backed up my notes into my Google account. Another feature missing is good note organization, the recent notes page is okay, but not great. No real record function, this app would be the absolute best if it had a sync and writing record function. No real feature upgrades in years, disappointing for a subscription app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌👌👌 app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"A lot of things are on premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works almost flawlessly with me. Sometimes the App doesn't react when I want to write something down, however that could also be beacause of my computer. Most of my Uni-Notes are on Squid, happy to be saving Paper! Overall definitely worth my money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but I believe you should add more option for faster tools for example double tap with two fingers and your pen can become a selection tool etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Highly highly recommended You can do nearly everything with this app 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"app quasi completa, suggerirei di inserire altri tipi di input (tipo la matita, penna stilografica) per migliorare la scrittura. inoltre sarebbe utile avere l'evidenziatore che non copra la scittura ma la metta in risalto"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hands down, its the best note taking app on android. I have the premium version, and I really like it. Would be more awesome, 1. If there was an option to use BLACK background or enable DARK MODE *for ruled pages*, I REALLY NEED IT! 2. If there was a possibility to create multiple folders within one notebook, for say different chapters. It would very useful, and these two features are available in the other apps competing with Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"अच्छा ही नही बहुत ही अच्छा सुखद अनुभव"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"See... This is a good application for pdf reading or writing but I would not consider this application for note taking. I know the developers are working hard but this is real truth.. The writing experience with s pen is not good it lags lot comparing other application like noteshelf.. Which is considerable for notetaking... On serious note... Squid need lot changes.... Lot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For 'handwritten' notes using a stylus this is a great app, that's what it's goal is and it achieves that very well. For me, I want to be able to access my notes on more than one device- this isn't really possible with this app, at least not natively."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great and has lots of features but sometimes if you want to write something it doesn't responds, so I have to wait until it works again. That's kind of annoying and it slowed down the work progress. If you could fix that pIease it would be really great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls download this the graphics and the controls are really good and it can absolutely help to draw."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Make my work easy regardless where and when, I always can make my annotations on PDF files and I can also sign PDF documents. I love this apps since day one I started using it until now which has been years, no complain👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best scrolling notepad useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app... Very much satisfied with it. Quite efficient ☺️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it because of all the background papers. It's good for musicians also to right down their notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app ninterfzce. Would love the ability to export select pages. Especially when teaching"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome App....strongly recommonding this one...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a really great app :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a lot of different note taking apps for school and Squid is definitely the absolute best! I use this app on my tablet (Samsung Tab S6) for school all the time and I love the different paper types. It's really helpful and saves me on using paper. Thank you to the developers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"it is very limited without the pro version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time for quick handwritten notes and reminders. Very easy to use, intuitive -- and separate undo/redo for each page of a document. I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great, Low Latency, Highly Accurate and Good Use of Pressure Sensitivity"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I want to rate it higher because I use it everyday but, I need more basic features. My handwriting looks horrible on here too. I wish it was as pretty as Inkredible, or even One Note. I'll vote on some suggestions for now but, let's hope I don't fall in love with another note taking app before I'm done with school. A monthly update would be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app, wish the team have the resources to expand to Windows & Mac OS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Faltaría que coloquen más herramientas de texto como negritas, itálica etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a really good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app works very well and it has allowed me to organize my school notes. The only downside I can see so far is the saving process. I can save locally but I have not be able to figure the cloud saving."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Pretty decent note taking with loads of features. But, somehow it still does not perform well on my Pixel Slate i7. Sometimes it would skip taking a note for a few seconds and would then write the whole thing. But, overall note taking is decent. It is just that small bug that made me wanna switch to other note taking app and don't want to invest myself in the pro version as of now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps to use for reading any PDF files that does not allow you to annotate or highlight. I also use this app for streaming notes when I teach online. Very good investment. One important note, if you plan to use a document or pdf that has a background design, it will not be shown on Squid Ink, but once you export the document from Squid Ink to a PDF file, the background design will show."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"F*** everything is PAID INTALLED SAMSUNG NOTES"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best s-pen app I know of. The whole reason I carry a Samsung Galaxy Note! Lists, calendars, sketches, flashes of inspiration - its all in there, and and backed up to the cloud. Highly recommended for people that just need to jot things down as opposed to typing them into a notes or memo app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is good. But you have to pay for everything in this app. Only note writing is free. Also images can be added to the notes and can be exported to PDF PNG and JPEG formats. PDF import is a premium feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Best appeal the pressure sensitivity. NO palm reject toggle or music tab paper tho. Tablature is most common for writing music& needed if you don't know theory like many. Also, the eraser isn't circular & hard to see& No choice of save location. The monthly fee deters longterm use as 3yr=$36, ridiculously high for an app that isn't updated with new tools. This is not a service. More might buy if it was 1-time fee $6. Price is supposed to be set to compete with similar apps its not."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience using SQUID, so fluid to write using Tab S7 plus. This app has the best display and tools as for me. I am enjoying it being a tutor, thank you for the wonderful app guys. Drawing and writing while teaching is so easy using SQUID, this app is what I needed. Fantastic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient for writing and correction with my pixelbook. Have all highlighting functions etc for writing. Easy to share. Use it daily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I loveee this app, it's very easy to use but there's one thing. Syncing! i was going to stop using google notes but noticed you couldn't sync the app with other devicess. I'm still going to use it though, I just wish i could view my notes on different devices :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but needs to sync all pages in to one like Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking and annotations app on Android! The unlimited canvas and multitude of tools and options are stellar."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best of the many I tried for my purposes (taking handwritten notes for business). I'm still considering the subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My experience is very good. The program is doing what it supposed to doing. No extras ..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"such a good apps.simple and easy to use.but if you can add rearrange pages Option , it would be nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Seems good, but I'm not adding a monthly subscription. I'm out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Stable app. Smooth and consiatent pen experience with pressure sensitivity and palm rejection working perfectly. However, Search capability is missing. No other frills"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A revolutionary app and it is the best in the store but need some improvement specially for medical student 1) it must have 2 pages view 2) open 2 pdf at same time 3) support different files type like pptx,..etc. 4) voice notes, sticky notes 5) cam scanner for pdf 6) ability to view my work throw different os or at least from browser 7) changing handwriting to device writing we need those updates asap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great with the SPen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome Very awesome I don't just like squid I love it I have just used it for a week but I love it already"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"On target. This app is really helpful for me managing my workday, will be even better if I could sync with my phone. Currently using on my tablet. Also, be able to have different types of pen and pencils. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok let me tell u my story.. I made a stylus pen so I wanted to try it and this app become my favourite to write my infinity notes 😁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super app for medical notes making"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very recommended app for those need to take notes ♡"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"shiteee wouldnt let me type without paying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for writing notes. Free version has all the basic necessities"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The free version is great. ZERO ads, tons of functions. This is the only good app that can tell my palm apart from my s-pen. EDIT: I had to downgrade this to 4/5. The page constantly gets bugged when scrolling or zooming. The entire page gets shifted (you can see a visible gap on the side of the page) and then every stroke you write gets shifted to the side as well. I always have to restart the app in order to fix this. Samsung Tab A 9.7"" with S-Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of best beautiful apps in note taking I wish if they add a translation When i push the word translate it self I wish that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice, best note taking experience I have found"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love It"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Free version is useful but very limited in features. Page templates are sufficient though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Please add copy and paste functionality"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Какой смысл если невозможно импортировать файлы"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well! Great for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for students trying to organize there notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"work great. Phenomenally Simple. Coming from S6 lite ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for opening the pdf..but please update the smooth turning of pages in pdf as it requires a lot of time to do so.Overall a nice experience with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"As good as the writing is (can specify pen input thus allowing for palm rejection, quick erasure with finger, etc) the more notes you take the greater the problem of find a past note. No search ability AT ALL: no tags, can't search for content, even just for titles! Please add search!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like using this app for handwriting notes. I have some suggestions: More pen types, automatic correction( I mean smoother writing while using pen) and tools should be divided into different sections. (Sorry for my English, I hope you've understand. I may have done mistakes.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was finding the great app that I could write my notes and share with others.. Yahhh , I found it ! Squid helps me a lot. Thank you ❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Amazing app for taking notes, the only problem is that organization in the app is a bit messy. Would give 5 star if there was a feature for us to put sub folders so I can organize my class notes better Edit: voted on their website for sub-folder but just found out that the problem started in 2013 and still hasn't been acknowledged by the developers yet..... really hope they will fix it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect app, some features are missing on the free version but it's amazing and it deserves a buy if you use it a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app, but I wish that I did not have to see the actual image of my note but rather just the words of what I saved it as if that makes any sense. Otherwise I love it, I have 8 different ""notebooks"" right now all labeled different things such as English 101 for my class stuff, I typically screen shot important stuff and simply load it to the app, name it and then move it to the appropriate folder, has helped me keep stuff organized. P.S. I love all the different options for page layout."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app but need pdf adding option for free also"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"저는 스퀴드 메모어플을 사용할 때에 주로 s펜을 사용합니다. 그리고 그림파일로 남겨둡니다. 그 부분에 있어서 스퀴드는 사용하기에 아주 간단합니다. 용도에 따라 남겨두면 후에 참고할 때에 여러가지로 쉽게 확인이 가능합니다. 다만 유료결제가 한눈에 파악되지 않는 부분은 체계를 잡아주시면 좋겠습니다. ps.어플 때문에 테블릿을 사려고 계획중입니다."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this apps. Easy to use. I used it to take note during my class. Its good. The only thing to say is sometimes when I want to zoom I mistakenly scribble on the note. Other than that I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been loving Squid for years (even back under its old name). I purchased in-app upgrades before the subscription plan became a thing. The only thing holding me back from upgrading to premium is the small number of cloud storage providers that are supported. My institution provides MS OneDrive so I'm not going to pay extra for Dropbox or Box. The moment that you add OneDrive support is the moment that I upgrade to premium!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool thing is infinitive page. It could be even beter if page would expand not only to the right and down but to all 4 directions. Quite often I use tool for mind maps and they grows to all 4 directions. It should be cool to being able to work with the same notes on pc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like the app so far. Only issue is pen pressure is wayyyyy too sensitive. Can't do consistently thin lines like in autodesk sketchbook or ibis paint. Would like a sensitivity slider like you would find in any drawing app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, i would give it 5 stars but unfortunately it lacks google drive syncing which i think is pretty basic. Also i would love to see a shape recognition feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good app for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The note app, for its intended use is great. The lack of connected features between multiple devices feels.....2012(ish)? I should be able to start a new note on my Note and then pull that same note up on my tablet to review or mark up. The only cloud options I see is Dropbox or Box. No Google drive, etc. If I can sync my grocery list from a free app across all of my devices, why can't I do this with a note app that I am subscribing to?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app for taking notes however sometimes when I'm adding pictures it freezes and shuts down. Also would be better if there was an automatic back up"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great purchase! Recomending it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is generally a very good app. I mostly use it for marking up PDFs, which it is quick at and saves them within the app as a separate file, rather than overwriting the original PDF. You can later export the marked up PDF which is great. The two most annoying things I find is, firstly, there is no option to swipe to the next page. Most of the time I don't need to do it, but it would be a nice option that is available in other apps. The more annoying thing, that I haven't found in another app and so would really make this app stand out is the ability to navigate a PDF using the built in bookmarks. I am often trying to navigate a multi-thousand page PDF and find myself lost only having the option to look at all the pages in a thumbnail view or to scroll the page number (not even type one in). If a bookmark navigation feature was added I really think that would transform my usage of this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its remarkable how such a seemingly simple app can be so helpful. I use it for a variety of things and the subscription is a no brainer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Okay but its rate is too low, so I don't know when it is realized. For this reason, I cancel my subscription. When it is updated, then I will subscribe again. Thank you for your answer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"That is what I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like using this app to take notes on my Pixel Slate, but it has a few issues that irk me sometimes and keep it from being 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I do not use it for complicated things, simply marking up and writing down answers for things I am studying. I use it quite a bit and it fills up my internal memory. I would love this app if it would write files to an external memory card."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Need some features like insert space horizontaly and vertically as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its a great app but i feel like it has its limits. I am an engineering student and i feel like there can more stuff added to make taking notes or even calculations better. I have a few ideas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The experience is better then a normal stylus, but does not compare well against it's competitors such as MS OneNote on the iPad or surface tablets. It's great got brainstorming, but the latency and delays oftenmake it difficult to use in faster environments."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great, but subscription service"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app to write notes. The best notebook ever. It would be 100% perfect, if it was possible to from one page to another by passing the page, live others pdf editors."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great features, never want to print paper again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the premium was good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"EDIT( Thanks for the response. I already voted for the feature, i just hope this is available asap. I know it's hard with that many requests so i just created a DropBox Account for the time. A local manual Backup is not an option, as i want/need automatic backups. Still, great App!) Really nice note taking App, coming from the competition. Although a Drive Backup Option would make it the best! THANK YOU for this App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for note taking ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic , so helping and a little need to buy the premier one , thats does not matter , turns out I have a writting app hahaha"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Premium user on a Huawei M5 Lite as an university student. It's great for marking up PDFs in class and taking notes altogether, the exporting of the file to PDF is very easy and has periodical backup for existing notes. Adding folders to archive existing notebooks and OneDrive backup would be my only improvements to this already great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Really love using it with my Note 10.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love using this app for brainstorming ideas in an infinite whiteboard of sorts. However, there are a few things that could be improved. I've noticed a problem where lasso tool would select things that are outside of the border. It makes it difficult to move around blocks of writing. Include the ability to scroll the screen while making a selection near the screen borders. Allow the eraser to get smaller than 1.0"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Reasons not to buy 1. 10$ for an app that randomly stops writing. 2. Tech support has an infinite number of reasons why its not their fault, my pen, my tablet, blah blah blah. Doesn't work any better on my phone/ with another pen. 3. Spend hours troubleshooting with us please. I am not ur tester, I am not being paid. Its cheap is what it is. You never bothered to actually test your product for problems. 4. Lots of long winded sentences that all chalk up to we already got ur money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful for the online Master's program I recently started. I've actually been using a free trial of the premium version that I will definitely be keeping."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work very well, very difficult to get change new inserted text or place annotations on the pdf. Had to purchase a subscription inorder to try the full app, which is not cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hi I find your app really helpful I have a question Will it convert my handwriting to text ? I was unable to find that option. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app very life changing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app for note taking. Although the tools is not that user friendly (all hidden in one button for tidiness), but the overall functionality make such imperfection being acceptable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Our only choice os-wise. But existing properties do not suffice the needs of the average user. Interface is way too simple as if its from some cheap app. It should have been like its apple counterparts, regal and resonating with professionalism. In its current state, it just feels like an app we are obliged to use, not an app deserving a monthly subscription to unlock basic features like importing pdf and highlighting. There should be at least 4 types of pen types too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far I prefer it to any other note pad apps I've tried. More writing utensils would be a good addition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, best money I've spent in a long time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"كويس بس مش اوي"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"iliked it a lot its verry simple to use ,pretty much compatable with all file, and much cheaper than evernote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best note taking app that I have ever seen and used. The Android users who wishes/love to write digital notes squid is the best ever app to use. You will fell in love after using it. And it's not comparable to any note taking app in playstore. Only problem is it loads the content slowly while scrolling the page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! I'm doing a lot of math and writing on pdfs is incredibly useful. Functionality is great and I'm really happy with the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just Superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app used to be 5 stars to me and it hasn't changed in how useful it is for note taking BUT after 4 years (maybe more) of use I'm making it one star because of how much this app has cost me now. I've paid a good $48+ for this app and imma be honest, this is NOT a $48+ app. At MAX it is $17. I'll be okay with a one time fee of $17 but now that I've paid $48+ I gotta speak out. This app is just leeching off wallets. You're not even striving to revolutionize note-taking. Plz fix."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its the best app for making handwritten notes or to edit pdf..👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add a move or hand button to move on the page, also add a feature of automatically backup in local storage after time intervals. Very nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just so good. Works like paper but without the size and portability limits of paper with it being electronic storage. Bring in photos and annotate away. Sketchs thoughts with ease. Just wish there was a decent typing input method. Developer reply says there is a one time purchase option for text input but I can't find that sorry. Just subscription which I'll not choose. I've no problem paying for updates as and when they happen but to have to pay to look at old work way in future is a no go zone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hellooo i just think that if the highlight can be behind the writing and have dark papers its would be better than goodnotes and maybe make the when writing with the highlighter make it 1 layer not many"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Lifesaver for this newly-paperless broke grad student! I no longer have access to free printing at school, but I also think best with a highlighter in my hand. Squid lets me mark up my hundreds of pages of weekly reading using my tablet and stylus, and makes it easy to keep all the files organized. My only gripe is that PDFs must be imported one by one--I really wish I could bring in the whole semester's worth of readings in one swoop."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app overall. Positives: - Ease in use with Samsung S Pen to write and mark up PDFs. - Ease in importing files from Files, Google Drive, etc. - Use of vectors for high quality touch ups What could be improved: - Ease in scrolling between pages - Ability to save colour palettes to use - Ability to create folders within notebooks to easily organise files - Customisable home menu views - colours, folders, etc. - Text options: add options to easily change font size, colour, bold/italic, etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Literally my favorite app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its very useful to taking online classes Especially for Maths tutors"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"i dont like it because you cant type and if you can i dont know how to"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used the pro version for few months... Things that I don't like are : the sloppy synchronisation (the biggest problem), can't swipe to the next page, outdated design, and can't changed viewing mode to continuous..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Ower all a wery good app but still lacking features like perfect circle drawing, and drawing circle from center to curve.... drawing a circle to fit a box is an awkward way of drawing circles. The dark mode is also annoying, keeps flashing white when page is scrolled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"GOOD"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for writing. Though they should add the folder and sub-folder feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great! It's very useful and very adaptable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I don't like this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Don't hesitate to upgrade to premium. Great app for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"pay 200 rupees then it will available text mode in this app😂😂🥴"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost anything can do with this apk!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love everything but the ability to organize notebooks into files is simply a must in this kind of app. It'd be nice if we would able to pay for types of papers we want because we won't be using all of it. Please bring theses feature quickly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Really quite poor! Rather surprisingly this just wasn't any good. On the plus side, the pen was reasonably responsive with a variable size. Sorry, that's it for positives. I couldn't get delete to work using the button on the s-pen but attempting to scroll the page with a finger deleted large quantities of text. When you do delete it isn't sufficiently granular. Anything other than a standard pen you have to pay for. I became disillusioned very quickly and deleted it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using this on my Samsung s6 tablet and its beaten out the rest of the apps I've been using. So much so its even replaced my paper journal. But however I would absolutely love to see - page color options - id like to have the note selection page mode immersive, like digital notepad skins or leather journals instead of just a page. - would be amazing to have my notes sync to my phone, I write notes on my tab with the s pen at work and I'd love to be able to just use my phone app as a referenc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"AWESOME"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Looking for an app that I can take notes and do homework in one place with good features that are helpful. I found it. Something that would be helpful would be to have the ability to sort pages into folders to organize them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for making notes I have tried many other apps for making notes for my subjects but this app provided all those fancy options that are required for making good notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very good app for study"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"edit: the customer service is amazing, I have changed the review due to their excellent professional attitude, a very special thanks to Christina. update: the issue got fixed after updating to Chrome OS 86 and using active stylus instead of finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A few bits not free of charge. Love PDF concept though text is storred as graphics, is my understanding, as if a photo of the scribbled document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Sometimes when I'm writing it moves the screen down and I can't find a way to fix it. It can be really annoying when writing. There should also be a way for them to hide the navigation bar so you don't have to worry about going to your home page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Doesn't allow access to the full page so my note is only on the left instead of across"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Had to pay for the subscription multiple times a month to get premium features to work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app but need some improvement like.... Palm rejection Access to highlighter for non prime users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! It's now my go-to app for note taking and the subscription is worth it too since it does help the team develop the app better. I wonder if its possible to add in straight and curved arrows? And perhaps a feature to be able to draw symmetric straight lines (like a reference line so the straight lines dont end up slanted sometimes?) Anyway kudos to the team for this app as it's amazing and is the only note taking app my old tablet can still support as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great note taking app, only loses a star for the inability to set the page size equal to the device's screen area or otherwise lock scrolling, which is currently a bit too easy to do accidentally on a tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. Gets the job done. I have a feature request for the devs. Please allow opening multiple notes side by side. The usecase I am aiming for is to open a PDF to read and annotate, as well as take side notes in another note both working in split screen. Right now, I have to open pdf in a different app to make side notes/summary. If this feature is implemented, It will be a 5 star app for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been searching for a good app for writing notes and drawing for a long time. I came across this app and thought of trying it out! I dont regret it at all! It's really simple and you can eaisly write on it. But I just wish we could wrote notes in the Cornell method without needing to purchase the premium version. But otherwise, this is an amaizng app and one of the best I've ever used! :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I Like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for android user"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Indispensible Tool! Squid was instrumental in my Master's Degree schooling. Along with note taking, the ability to import PDF's and noteate them was ke. I've also used Squid quite a bit in sketching network diagrams for work, room design for home, and the occasional bit of art sketching. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Everything already great. But I really hope I can create more sub file under one big file. Example: semester 8 > week 1 > my notebook name. Also I hope there is more pen type. I'm happy I can insert my pdf file. I also can write my notes on it. But I'm hopping for more than that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just a few more Pens would be great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Clean and responsive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. for ph.no#'s grocery lists and all!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App is amazing, 2ould like to get more drawing options like auto drawing x2D and 3D graphs or auto draw a tablet or auto draw a sjape from point to point or even have the ability to twist the shape."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its probably the best app of its kind for Android, but some features are lacking vs comparable apps for iPad. The copy/paste functions are a bit awkward, and it lacks the ability to reorder pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great alternative to Goodnotes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good app but really lacking customization options. E.g. no option to reduce the size of the toolbar or to even hide it. As it is it takes up a significant portion of the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great apps.very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing, I use it to take notes with a stylus pen for university and my notes are pleasant to look back on. My stylus works really well with this app and it makes the writing look really smooth, as well as drawings. I would love for there to be a way to save a colour and the pen thickness and go back to it whenever you want to, as I tend to go back and forth when changing the thickness and colour of the pen, because I tend to use different thicknesses for titles and paragraphs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using Squid for 4 years now. It is my go-to processor for notes, thoughts, images, drawings, and post preparations, for example. All around excellent tool for decision-makers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is amazing and really easy to use and it is really useful for writing my notes for school and making check list and I just love everything about this app is amazing thank you for making this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add function to hide the navigation bar and status bar please."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's just an app that beggs for money. I downloaded it to take notes for school and write on pdf files, but I can't do any of that unless I give this program money. I'm not going to shovel money into an app that I don't know if it even works, especially when there's free one's that work perfectly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Using it as my notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Zooming in an out can offset the pen input from the screen on occasion. I have to close the note and reopen it to realign everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All round very gooood , just some suggestion to make it a better app , when you using landscape orientation , the color picket wont show that color gradient thing that available in the potrait mode , and add more feature , ex, page colouring not only for blank page , make it so other template can change the colour of the paper too , and make the writing smoother with some kind of automation script that smoothen scrubby lines during writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greatest app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish there was a way to scroll way without having to switch to view - only mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just wish I could import files other just images and PDF (for example if Squid automatically converted PowerPoint and Word files to its own format). Otherwise love the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very intuitively, the free version has more than enough features to work with and plenty of different sorts of background. Enjoy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The App is better than I expected, just add more shapes and a dark theme and this would be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use and correct. a very important feature for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Once you figure out how the app works, it good. Adding notes and highlight in pdf documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No doubt. The best note taker application. Of you're looking for a pen tab or note pad where you can take note by writing with your finger. And it's relatively fast smooth and good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Definitely my best experience annotating PDFs with a stylus (as a pen/highlighter)... and it's got good templates/backgrounds for note taking too. Plus I can easily import PDFs from Google Drive and then export them back to Drive (in addition to the cloud backup of the Squid database)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app, but I also think there are a lot of features it can add. For example, a bucket tool or an automated to tool that makes drawn shaped like a circle more uniform. Something I wished this app had would be a dark mode. The best way to implement it would be to make all the colors negative or use an equation to change all the rgb colors to be the opposite (i.e black to white), it is easily more visable to see through a color wheel."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"As of October 2020 still doesn't have shape detection, no sync option and the same terrible interface it had 18 month ago. I see very little difference between the app today and the way it was in middle of 2018."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just been using for a week. So far it's been great! Completely solved my problem of making live notes while giving online classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to take notes with! I tried a lot of apps before I decided I liked this one the most. The free version is great, and the paid version is even better. Very clean interface and easy to use. 10/10 would highly recommend to anyone that needs to take notes on a tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great and has allowed me to fully digitize my notes. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the not being able to create sub folders in notebooks, which would help me organise my notes even further. If that could be incorporated into the next update then I would give it 5 stars!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a wonderful app I used on my chromebook tablet. I use it as doc markup tool and note taking. Using a USI pen is just perfect. I surely hope this app provide more premium features in addition to those already perfected ones. Going extra miles would certainly impress your users. One of the examples is better panning performance and better pdf scrolling and even link supportin the doc. Do like the community voting, but sad to see some basic requests not coming soon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app super easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pressure sensitive use of the pixelbook pen and other stylus, several options for paper choice, including wide rule, college rule, Cornel, blank, of course, and with the paid app, several highly customized options. Very accurate input with no noticeable lag and many choices for writing tools with each having their own choices of size, via slider, and color. Great to have as a digital notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it to draw blue prints on the 4"" bold sheet And create a complete folder of each costumer . Ok 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using Squid for almost a year now and I love it. It may not have the most features but the team makes sure that what they do have is optimally functional. Speaking of the team, for the first time I had an issue with an app malfunction. They were quick to personally respond and correct the issue. They folks really care about the users of their product. I will happily pay for premium going into the future"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love using this app to take notes and journal. The color picker is really easy to use, and I love that you can change the color of existing text. The only thing I have trouble with is the location of the undo button. When I have my textbook open in split screen, it's really easy to miss the undo button and accidentally close the split screen... Please add undo as an option for the s pen button!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is so nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome 😊 I am happy with note making now I want premium membership"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using the free version and this thing does a lot well. I tried a ton of different apps before settling on squid....works great on my chrome tablet and stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best note taking apps I've found. Does pretty much everything I need it to do. It would be nice to see more pen options but other than that I have no issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is crazily guddddd."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Need To Be Premium!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great user-friendly App."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great for taking notes and is able to process input pressure on Samsung. However, I cannot give the last star because I really miss more pen presets, like custom defined pen width thin/normal/bold etc. The sidebar to set the width is difficult to operate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app overall, would like the pinch out to be smoother. The very small load time when zooming out looks awful. I think the 120hz display on the samsung tab s7 should be taken full advantage by the the developers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hands-down, the best notetaking app I have ever experienced."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the app, I've been using it extensively as a teacher. One gripe though, pages tend to float after you swipe and lift your figure off the screen. Would be nice if movements stops the moment you lift off."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a really good app, it can totally be used to substitute a notebook. The payed version is perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Goooooooooddd"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am not a good note taker - until now. I use this on my chromebook, and I love the combination. HOWEVER - when my writing hand touches the screen before the stylus does, the screen instantly scrolls to the far end of the page, and I have to pinch and swipe 5 or 6 times to get back to where I was writing. A sheet of paper has never done that to me. This is a HUGE nuissance. It has also crashed on me 2 or 3 times, erasing up to 15 minutes worth of notes. THAT SAID - it has replaced my notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is an amazing app that allows me to annotate my pdfs beautifully and perfectly. I think Squid can improve by allowing us to scroll through the pages instead of having to tap the arrow for next page. Other than this minor opinion, I think squid is still an amazing note taking and I recommend that everyone at elast give it a try."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"May I suggest to have a different pen type"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app I really liked it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Teribble"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I can't open it, it keeps closing on itself"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most useful app on my phone!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very slick app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works great on a chromebook. I haven't had any problems importing pdf's taking notes on them or anything. The pay version is completely worth it (12$ for the year). My only complaint is a more robust file system. Ex) You can have one notebook for a class and import pdf's into it, I just wish you could group those pdf's into groups."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for sketching."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would've given 5 stars, if there was an highliter available."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not compatible with my moto stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great Application! Use it mainly to mark off cross stitch charts and it works really well. The highlighters are easy and accurate, the depth of colour and width of the markers can be changed. I bought android to use Pattern Keeper but it doesn't recognise any PDF i tried to read so default I downloaded Squid. Honestly I can't think of one thing about it I would change"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good, but needs improvements like: A zoom in writing panel A better organisation system (Notebooks within subfolders and folders) A favourite pens and highlighters section But, I have to admit the writing on this app feels super smooth With these, and some other improvements, it could definitely be the best android note-taking app out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Prefer this over onenote anyday"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"wonderful. enjoyed the app a lot. I have two feature requests: 1. search functionality in list of notes and notebooks 2. in notes page, keep eraser icon outside not under pen icon drop down. eraser should be more accessible. if possible, please add 2-3 favorite selected color along with pen,eraser icons. thanks for useful product."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app for every student 😊."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No reminders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is phenomenal except I wish the eraser was accessible directly on screen and I didn't have to select it in two stroke, as well as few main colors could selected with no distraction."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add dark mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best I've found, period!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Besttttt"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No palm rejection makes life too difficult. I love the UI but no palm rejection is what stops me from using the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nothing but success. I have a samsung tab a 9.7 with spen and the default app lags behind when my notes become large. After I started using squid that lag is no more, my pen movements is a lot smoother and just gives a lot more pleasant experience than the stock app. Thank you devs!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing app for using my digital class workbooks. I'd subscribe to premium if you let me export multiple specific pages at once, not just current page or every page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app.. actually best right now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good, not at great. I wish it had more colors or would let me create colors. It doesn't have enough shapes. It has 2, square and circle"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Format and layout is the closest to Samsung notes on previous devices which I prefer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fairly new user. So has worked exceptionally well. Pretty remarkable its features at such a reasonable cost. Very high quality product."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great addition to my galaxy tabs, great for note taking, and submitting assignments converting them to pdf."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great update, fixed my only complaint!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is so useful. Ilove it so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice it is !! I am able to feel extremely organized! But I do not have a pencil the digital! Not too many options I would like to text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful note app. I hope you can include more options in your geometrics and also add functional waves like sine, pulse, square waves etc would be an excellent addition. Plus increase more sensitivity on the sides and edges. I find this app very useful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Could we have searchbar option? I read my textbooks from here and it's hard to find certain keywords."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I would happily by a pro version of the app, but I'd really not have to subscribe for additional features. Also, I would love to see more features be added like maybe the ability to dimension things outside of counting boxes. Edit: Gotta say, this team is incredible. not only do they respond to support, but they also took issue and pushed out an update. this is mission critical for me, so they kept me working. fantastic team"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using almost everday, great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app - I use it whenever I need to make notes. Saves so much paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT 😊 APP FOR TABLETS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is easy to use, and the premium is not that expensive for allowing me to work on documents. Would recommend if you plan to use long term."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Last few week its not workings and i need to uninstalled and installed again. All import pdf and note on pdf also gone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Esta excelente el premium lo único por lo que pongo 4 estrellas es porque hace falta una opción para guardar plumas o lápices favoritos y no estar cambiando la configuación a cada rato entre color y grosor, se tarda mucho si quieres usar distintos ""tipos de plumas"" para títulos, secciones, gráficas y demás."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love to be organised and this app helps so much. I can take notes, draw graphs for my uni work as well as weekly planners! Only time I have ever paid for premium features and I love it! Only few suggestions: for the text box, have some more options like to centre text and being able to rotate e.g. so you can use text to label the vertical axis on graphs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I might be tempted to pay money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for all you note taking and planning needs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note, please add more features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for taking and storing notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied. One of the best app to be used with S Pen. I've subscribed to use the full feature, able to edit PDF, etc. I never regret that decision. 😃"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very natural writing compared to other app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's good for taking notes for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and features are adequate for my smartphone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has everything!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls add few more features in free version. But at the end app is great.❤️❤️❤️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"They solved my troubles quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"All would be perfect if not for the abysmal notes organisation and UI that feels outdated. While I can live with the latter, the former made me switch to other app after a year of using Squid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Trust me...this is a very good app...very simple..just give it a try..u never regret it...I have use and even paid many premium apps but this is the free one and the best one...so grab it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app, use it for note taking. Gets very annoying not being able to lock a page though. Simple feature that has somehow been overlooked. If you want the page to constantly move before you write this is the app for you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If only the app could have a night mode, vertical scrolling, and swiping to get to the next page enabled, it would be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for without lines notes making"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please make available on ios, squid is amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A complete note taking app for android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can you make it so the documents scroll down instead of side by side? Would be easier to write on so i dont have to cram at the bottom of every page. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It has made virtual school so much easier and organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for pdf editing and creation. Would love more font options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Love you can erase with a finger"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, I really love how well this let's me write over my schoolwork and easily import/export pdf files. My only wish is that it would let me add pdf files to an existing import - however I don't think that's currently possible. Maybe on the next update 😉"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Low quality app. Now it asks me to subscribe even though I paid for an annual subscription. I went ahead and paid again. I still can't use the subscription tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app on android..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Erase options is suck ...if I want erase some dots.it erase all whole the page ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent use for my university notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This review was made in 2014 This app works well and is very responsive. Much of the snote features can be found on this app too. On the aokp ROM, it will recognize your s-pen and allow you to use the side button as a shortcut. I also like that it has a looseleaf template. Suggestions: °The ui is a little bland, maybe there could be a choice of color for the side menu. °Would also appreciate a manuscript (sheet music) template."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note-taking experience on Android/Chrome OS I've found. Handwriting is quick and smooth. Two issues keep this from being a five star app: 1. No vertical scrolling. Pressing buttons to turn the page is distracting, and takes me out of the flow of my work. 2. File management for .PDFs is clunky. I have to import a .PDF and edit it, then overwrite the original. On a Chromebook, this is doubly annoying because there's no native access to the Chrome OS Google Drive. Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The ideas are fantastic, but some annoying bugs stop this from being outstanding. 1) the infinite canvas applies only bottom and right of the canvas. Not really infinite canvas, in my opinion. Also, this isn't a bug as I was asked to raise a feature request if I feel strongly about it. Also, the selection lassoo seems tobe overzealous; if you draw a circle shape around some text, the selection turns into a square and selects some things outside the selection too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Too good app with no adds"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"this app is ok needs more colors or whatever this app is just a big blah"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love everything about it and it fits my needs perfectly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my favorite drawing app for my Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 and Note 9. I also have an iPad Pro and none of the drawing apps for it can beat Squid for ease-of-use, intuitiveness, navigation, and file management. I would happily pay for an iPad Pro version if they made one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love!!! the only note tasking app I use! great drawing and note taking app with lots of great templates & simple user friendly capabilities. also veryyyyy precise writing and drawing. I hardly get any lag or times where it marks a place other than the exact place I placed my stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for screen sharing with zoom!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Provide more facilities in the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly with galaxy s7 plustab. I prefer it to the samsung app. Worth paying extra for it too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Okay but waste app...not able to save in jpeg format and png. Only pdf saving. Also you should lock the screen while righting on the page. like i have to careful so that every time bottom tools doesnt shw up. Now dont ask me to send feedback on your mail id. Idiots."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for hand writing. I am a statistics professor at university. In the current scenario we are teaching from home and online. My question was how to teach formulas and derivation without board work. So I searched Google and found almost 10 apps to solve my problem. I tested all apps and found squid is the best app for driving formulas. My students are also happy to learn exactly like they learn in the live classroom. Thank you developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app to take notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is good, but very simple. It could have more pen styles and better tool tab. PS: I'm a premium user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi, is it possible for you guys to make it compatible with a touch screen laptop? There are note a lot of note taking apps for a touch screen laptop and I would really appreciate it if you guys looked into that!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is awesome!!!!!!!! This app is very impressive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Dude we dont have a normal eraser. But rest is good i love it. I am gonna take the premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for note taking and even some rough sketching. pdf markup works but not the way i want it but great none the less. It would love if there was handwriting to text conversion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No synchronization. No different pens, brushes, etc. Limited number of figures (only 3). Other sides are fine."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app . Highly recommended , This is very useful for online classes , me , my friends and our teachers also using this app . This app is also very helpful for all age groups . Don't think so much just go for it .👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good 😊 app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Only thing missing is coloured lined backgrounds and more brush types"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just wish my old tablet was compatible but works great on my LG stylo phone for me to make client notes to easily upload to my charting system."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app works well. Unfortunately, too many features need a subscription. I am okay with buying them (I basically bought whatever I could buy), but I don't want to pay a subscription also for this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think the app is great but its missing some features that can make it better. Like highlighting in a straight line and bulk import pdfs and maybe folder in folder (sub folders)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"it’s a very convenienve app to do a note ,butaway that have something have to pay money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy!! Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I give all star but 1 problem in this app is in this app we cant type Option is there but we have to purchase . Please free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful for my university reading, will definately return if needed in the future :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and efficient. Can work around current features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would have given it five stars but its still missing some feature like color filling, page colors etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"great for taking notes, hate that you cant scroll without using the arrows at the top, as well as not that easy to swith between pen and eraser ( eraser erases chunks at a time versus size of the eraser you choose, like cant erase part of a line with out it erasing the whole line reguardless of size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice, but very less is available without subscription. Otherwise good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Dont dowload it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very very very bad but have good feTures but only for premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent , really liked to use this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is generally ok, but there are no regular updates despite promising this in the subscription plan. Basic features like the keyboard covering text boxes at the bottom of the screen are not fixed. Things missing...bullet points, mixed font sizes. Thanks for the feedback, I'm looking forward to the keyboard fix."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Squid is HORRIBLE!! I thought it was cool that you could make notes with just your finger. Just don't write anything too impotant because the notes seem to magically disappear--like when you've made a large grocery list, are in the middle of shopping and your list suddenly gone!!!! FOREVER! NO WARNING! NO ""Are you sure you want to delete?"". Nope.....you're stuck with just getting the 3 things you can remember from your list and you knw you'll be mad as HELL when you get home. Avoid Squid!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Solid, useful app. Easy to use and customize. Squid has become my go-to note-taking spot. Wish there were more pen selections, but that is niggling compared to the benefits it offers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I found it exactly as I anticipated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I actually like this app a lot, however a great way of life update would to make a straight highlighter, because it is very difficult to highlight text on a pdf without it looking wonky and squiggly. However a great app overall!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is all I needed for my notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would just like to say that this app is the best!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Lately there's a problem uploadind notes to dropbox"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app But pls give some tools free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best hand writing experience, for whatever reason much accurate than basically any other android app on a Note 10. Missing things: a search capability within the handwritten documents like in the new Samsung Notes app or OneNotes. The file system is not as good as the one in the new updated Samsung Notes app (with subfolders for instance). A lot of features are available in the free version. Nice if there was a life subscription option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Excellent functionality and overall performance, however I would like to see more layers of organisation. The current format of notes in notebooks with no way of grouping notebooks, or notes within notebooks is disappointing especially in such an otherwise excellent note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Nice erase feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, well organized"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app but reduce the price plz"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gem of an app, but like all good things, it's goodness just came to an abrupt end when the developers moved the delete button to a menu option. They just messed up perfection 😔"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for graph paper and working out problems"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app may be good, but its terrible value. THe app doesnt supports opening PDFs, (the main thing I want to do) unless you pay $5. The app Nebo is $10 for the entire thing, and feels far better. So why would anyone use this app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am really enjoying this app for note taking, but two things that take away from my positive experience are the inability to have an account that automatically syncs notes between devices, and not being able to create folders within folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very efficient and practical. I only wish there was an option to add extra space next to an imported pdf file."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is good but the only thing which is annoying is that whenever I zoom out the page it shows another background and takes time to adapt to the current style it looks unprofessional when recording the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very exciting experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No Trial version , forcing purchase"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have app to take notes. I am using the free version and its awesome. U can opt for the paid version if u need more features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good for taking notes with a stylus or something similar. But I couldn't find a way to switch between typing and writing. If you only write then this is probably the best app for it. If there is a way to type then that would make this my choice for notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Its great for taking notes on my pixelbook but there are plenty of featrues taht it can implement to make it better expecialy for the cost. There is not recording feature. there is not way to download a powerpoint onto one page. and a lot of other featehrs that other not taking apps have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No text input option .do not install the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"does what you need it to if you pay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Ive been using this app for taking notes with my tab s6 lite and its been good so far. However, I wish the writing was smoother since i can still see some rough edges whenever i write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Really like the app This was just to get your attention can you Please introduce Black Paper that you can write on with White colour it will be a game changer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is pretty useful and well though out app. Perfect for writing study notes and even in free version, i offers a well rounded package."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Available on older android os always a plus. Simple to use and does what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"""take notes and pdf mark ups"" you have to pay for the subscription to even use the PDF function. You gave to pay to use shapes, to use the highlighter, so do anything. This is worse than microsoft paint if you don't pay the $10/year. It's cheap, but there are better free options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Facing problem with zoom in and zoom out ...please solve that fast ....other things are awsome...but this zoom problem is very bad ✌️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app on my Samsung Tab S6 and I love it. Great note taking app, all the writing options are customizable, ability to organize notes, really great experience so far. Also has some handy palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is Ok Ok not too good I suggest that it must have the option for better customisation that will help students for effective work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Friendly interface and is easy to learn and use. More features would be great but other than that it has everything i need right now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It should be completely free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tried a lot like this. This does the job best. Pros: infinite paper, black bacground, deffault note, great pen support. Cons: nothing so far, every error I encountered is patched, plus their suport team reacts almost instantly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for teaching"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this but there is something missing. You need to add sign in option to create the account because me as a university student i use it in my tablet and also in my phone to check my notes when i missed my tab. Please put this feature as soon as you can. Have a nice day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app, use it for school, even paid for premium, only complaint ist that there is no snap grid, so you have to manually align your text/whatever by hand and so it might not look that grid, adding a snap grid that makes objects snap to text, the lines on the paper or etc would be very helpful and help me a lot!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"App was supposed to renew a monthly subscription on september 7. It's only semptember 6 but it automatically renewed and charged on my card. I'm requesting a refund because I am cancelling my subscription as I haven't used the app for the past few weeks. Besides, I still have one day left before they should have charged me. I already emailed google play about this but they haven't approved my request yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"You should include the ability to search for note names"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note app that is made to work with Samsung S pen. Note to the developer: Thanks for disabling the back button to prevent closing the app with palm touches during writing ... i hope in the next upate to see a way to hide or disable the bottom navigation view because since it also interferes with my palm while writing causing un intended actions due to touching my palm with the screen... Thanks for this amazing app though... great effort.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for home base learning and it can be environmentally friendly as you can write on PDF or notes on screen rather than printing out the notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Finally found an app I like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for notes! Not clustered with ads."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app but they have to give some tolls for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice one. Lot of helpful in taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very helpful Application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works amazingly well! As a student, it comes in very handy for school. Definitely well worth being recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Other apps provided pdf import facilities free of cost. So this app also should have such feature to again be the most preferred application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No trial"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for taking notes . But pls when i zoom in or zoom out it take time to load ..... It takes just a second but it takes away the feeling of writing on a paper. Pls make it like if we are viewing a pdf... Except this the app is fantastic it has everything you need to make notes like shapes highlighter and many more .Thanks for the response."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish it had cloud back up with Google drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"add Google Sign in option,,, best app..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for the S-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"WE NEED NEW FEATURES The app is good, it really met my needs. THE THING IS the company should listen to its customers complains and suggestion. The Squid forum is really interesting but if the company do not deliver the suggestion and addresses the complain, it becomes obsolete. Thanks for the feedback"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and understand! Makes my life easier when transferring files to get my work done!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's an OK app. I wish that they would listen to their customers. Simple requests have been asked for YEARS(more sync options, better toolbar layout, folders in subfolders etc.) and the list goes on. They seem to only care about subscriptions and not focus on actually updating and improving the app (which is getting dated). Nebo is a great alternative, but still have issues. This is as close to Good notes as we can get, and it's sad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for students as i am also a student and use it Found it very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good looking interface and smooth experience but need premium version to have more features . Need to add some different pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The upper status bar could be little bit smaller so that we could get more space to write. Rest it's best app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app is good but everything I need is premium... It was totally waste of time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best free note taking apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"of all the note taking apps for android, this has been the one to beat regarding features, UI, and page settings! just wish there were a way to edit pen settings, like pen sensitivity and stabilization. no matter how smoothly i write, my writing still looks shaky (you can even see from the app's screenshots that the pen is not entirely smooth). that is where apps like metamoji and noteshelf are have this one beat. would also prefer if there were syncing instead of backup & restore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth every penny!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am regularly using this app and like it. I am expecting handwriting to text conversion feature like Samsung notes will be added in future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app. Add any PDF to extend any note. Download PDF templates that resemble notebooks or whatever style page you like and go to options -> insert PDF -> after. You're not locked into the sheet styles that the app provides."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Could be a good app but has a major fault. Notes tend to vanish and the erase function locks on or off. Unusable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Erase option not good,u cant erase a part of a line,as it gets completly erarsed,but page option is good,can be used to teach online lessons"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best thus far. However can we please have a Cornell style but without summary section, as my notes are a few pages. Then I'd add the final page with a summary. With that addition, absolutely perf. Already bought tho. I noticed college ruled has an infinite size. If we can do that for Cornell that would be amazing!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As my notes grow, I would like a good way to search for them by their titles"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Timeline on when we're getting better note organization?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"so far I'm really enjoying how easy this is to use. It's enabled me to set up a digital binder of notes for multiple subjects, and makes taking notes in pdf's of textbooks quick and easy. That said, I really wish you could swipe to move to the next page, rather than tapping arrows. It greatly slows me down and causes a disconnect from the otherwise fluid and natural feeling of writing in a notebook. If they add this feature in the future, I'll definitely revisit my review"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for making notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the best in the market due to several reason, ergonomy fonctionnability, intuitive. But it really need one thing to be perfect. You need to implrement a tool to have a sort of dual screen with one side with a pdf that we can open and one side with a blank text sheet. So we can easily comment pdf without using the little borders and space of the pdf in question. Like it has been the success of Amanote (one document- one sheet). If you could do the same with the handwritten tools you have. You would get the perfect app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful app for making notes. I have been trying this over a week for now and it is just perfect. Just one suggestion though could you add colour wheel for the pens for the upcoming update ??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app than other love it and its premium Upgradation is also low at cost but if its free then it is my love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Da best noting application i've ever used , even without paying for it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very handy app. Still not using everything it can do, so it can only get better. Currently testing it as a basic alternative to KnitCompanion which became unusable for me after latest upgrade. Would like subfolders some time?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There's still a lot of work to be done. Coming from an ios device I must point out: First of all, double tap for undo is a must. Secondly, the tools should be hiding when not being used making more space for the interface. Even though I can continue for ages il keep it simple, as a medical practitioner I tend to use the highlighter a lot,it is really helpful for it to become a straight line and correct its self in a straight path because no one can drawa straight line onmobile.Keepupthegoodwork"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Laughable app lmao"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app if you are in school or not"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! It is a must-have for all students !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's awesome for classes and taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wow !!! I am so happy to use it❤❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Though I'm currently using the free version but it still has many cool features available. Beside the obvious smooth handwriting capability, what I really like is the free selection tool. You can't get it in similar apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I buy pdf pack but its not coming...I wasted 330 Rupees"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Now, admittedly I don't exactly use this app for it's intended purpose. I use this app for drawing and thumbnailing and honestly it works wonders for that. I don't think I'd ever draw a finished image on it, but it works well for sketching. My only complaint it that if you don't pay the 5$ for the extra tools, you don't get a working eraser."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app i learn on this app and draw in this app this is lovely app i request to all to down load this app you all who will download you will love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👌🏻"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Indeed the best app. I wish when moving the paper around the paper doesn't just disappear and reappear. It would make pinching and moving paper around much more easier if everything appears and moves together. Overall great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only big problem is the quality of the written text. It is clearly behind the conpetitors and you can see that the text is a series of broken down straight lines with coarse resolution. Everything else is good, but it really hurts the experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is simple and best app for android. It also has all features like highlighters, pen, colors, PDF's and more! But It really would be good if we have calligraphy, fountain pen and headers. Overall the app is amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Can't create subgroups!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"nice app but make the tool package free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent responsivity and in general a smooth experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for keeping notes for the university. Although some features are missing, the app overall is quite good. Has the potential to compete the iOS note apps. Great work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Supper for study"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Terrible interface if using on an Androidtablet. Not suitable while using with a stylus (so basically what this application was built for )"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and bought the premium subscription. I mostly use it for taking notes in school with my pen on my Tab S Lite but also for writing essays at home with a keyboard. It works pretty well in both situations although it excels at taking quick notes due to the missing change fonts,underline, cursive and bold options as well as that it is difficult to change the font size precisely due to the slider. I'd also like to be able to snap objects to each other. Overall pretty good tho"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Japanese characters are garbled when exporting to pdf. Would rate 4/5 if this bug was fixed. I wish there was a way to write on single pages while switching between pages as if in infinite size mode. Panning the current page in restricted size mode needs to be infinite because pen edge accuracy is very bad. You currently cant move the page beyond the edge of your screen. Changed to 1 star because devs don't fix bugs in their own app. Fixing bugs isn't a suggestion, it's a requirement!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for note taking but we want more pen options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Solid app.. only gripe is limited shapes on the toolkit. Recommended otherwise."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice and fast interface. A great note taking app for pen enabled tablets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, but I wish they had a simple side lined page format.... cornell is good, but sometimes i dont want another horizontal box below.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great app for notetaking - I like that you can directly import pdfs to mark up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works better than anything I've tried."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent. I've used this for years and it still works flawlessly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thats great thank you for all you afford"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's simple and nice while having a at-a-glance overall. Really recommend this app to those who wanted to do handwritten notes instead of typing it out. Also, it has this autosave feature which is extremely helpful as your work will not be gone after an accidental click to the exit. After all, I really like this app and it does help me a lot on taking notes. Thumbs up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love the app but I wish there was a better use of space, for instance the pen icon has a lot of options inside of it, the highlight icon and eraser should be on the bar not inside the pen icon I wish you could fix this because it's really annoying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever What a hell no fonts no highlighters"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good application for writing.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app for note taking and pdf editing. This has sent the previously used like-apps packing. However, I'll love to have the ability to create folders in the app nd also folders in folder so as to enable proper categorization. Well done Team."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like squid but one thing that really bothers me is that it takes so much effort to change the tool. For example writing a fraction is pretty annoying when you have to do 6 clicks to change to the line-tool and back to the pen again. The feature request for improving that exists since 2014 and is the third most voted request but unfortunately it seems like the developers ignore it. :( Changing the color is equally frustrating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app is OK, however I rate so low because of two reasons. The first, the app lacks of a very important feature: Palm rejection. And the second because some of the features are extra and you have to pay 10euro per year !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Teachers friendly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So nice app for notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"2 features I think many users would love to see: 1. having the ability to bookmark pens (like in OneNote), and 2. full screen mode. Dark mode would also be nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app for s pen user"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Lies. You can't markup a pdf unless you pay. I'd be fine with that don't make me download it to find out. Now I'll just make sure to pay for a different app thats upfront."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great app, but lack of sync in 2020 is shocking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an Awesome app! I really Loved it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A solid app for note taking. The only issue I have is the sensitivity. It's like any little imperfection in my writing is magnified by 25%-50%. Other than having to redo the notes later it's smooth. I think it's a good app. I will check the help to see if I can resolve the shakey issue. But worth a try. If I get all of the options (waiting to get a new tablet) then I will update my review."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very helpful. I like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Much smoother than Bamboo paper and Jamboard. But there must be full screen writing mode and notebook option like Bamboo app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice aap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Expensive lmqo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great app! My one and only wish is that it had more pen options. (fountain, calligraphy etc. ) Overall though I think it's the best note app out there bar none and I've tried a bunch. It blows the rest out of the water. Easy to use, easy to control, PDF import, ink color choices, awesome pen interaction and more. I use it all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid 65 rupees for premium but it is showing error right after making payment and I am still not a premier member. I tried it three times and everytime my money got deducted from my bank account. Is this a scam or something? There's no active stylus option too. Waste of money and time. Do something immediately and return my money back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for all of my notes and PDF reading for 6 months now, and I love it! I can easily import PDFs, annotate as I read, edit my notes, add pages to the document, make sketches to convey my ideas, and send my noses to others for collaboration. I would enjoy a more robust note organization structure, but the existing system with folders works well enough for now. I also appreciate being able to back up my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"😝😗😃😗😄😗🤨🤪☺"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App Everything is there that is needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is good, but still lacks features to make it an every day note taking app. I come from using Goodnotes on Apple and I haven't been able to find an app that is as good as that one. For example, the lack of palm rejection (this bothers me the most), a zoomed in continuous writing box, more geometric shapes, line types, etc. But overall is a good app that solves my needs with some hiccups for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing note. I have control that i need. To make it better, i suggest that an account (esp. already purchased premium) is linked to another device with same email. So i can open same file witth differentt devices. Overall, i appreciate it. Good job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!! I like this app over the iPad Good Notes. I use this app with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and it feels like writing with pen and paper where as on the Ipad with the iPad pencil it feels like writing on glass and the pencil slides on the glass. It is easy to write neat and clear with Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"For 5 star , develop it like liquid text app. You are not at par , huge room for development.....you are just average..know it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Yes you are correct but by adding the shapes feature for free this app can compete with many other free apps like onenote and samsung notes , your app offers nice note taking features but just misses the top spot because of the unavailability of feature for adding shapes for free , as i think this feature should be present , if i find the experience better then i can think of purchasing the premium features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I loved it, I bought premium. Would love if you could add a feature to highlight in a perfect straight line"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Practical for stylus - based use! For my needs, it's perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent alternative for notability on android, works incredibly with my 8 inch Samsung galaxy tab s2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for students nd who ever wish to have electronic hand written notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent! It just needs folders!!!!! Please add folders!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a great writing app but I wish there was a way to clear recent notes after you've put them in a folder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is an amazing app which i can do everyy thing with that, the most perfect one, but it still lacks something, can you please add colored papers to the next version? For example sometimes i wanna use a yellow or pink paper, or even a black paper like a blackboard, but the papers only come in white!! And also when opening a pdf, sometimes i need to change the background color so my eyes are less annoyed, but it is not possible, i ask your creative and talented team to please add this option:)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, but I get an error every time I try to sync to dropbox. I would wholeheartedly add a star to my review if this was fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I could not even - at least not for free - insert typed text using my keyboard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"IT'S PERFECT! And the premium price is super worth it BUT pleeeease include a function to change the background color... the lines and dots are too blue"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Eh kinda disappointed.I was hoping to have at least be able to use text without paying and other stuff but I might sound like a karen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Seems adequate, but $1 a month or $10 a year? Nope. Free to uninstall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love being able markup PDFs. Wish I could markup more file types!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic! Perfect for my handwritten math notes! Simple and very easy to use. Don't have any problems with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A pretty solid note taking app. Stylus support is really solid, and there are some nice workflow gestures while in a document. The interface is also pretty straightforward and doesn't look too dated. However there appears to be a couple of basic features missing, such as searching for notes by title, some sort of gesture for going to the next page in a document, and allowing to vertically scroll through a document. I also don't like how you can't see where you're scrolling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for notetaking have been using it a lot for school on a Chromebook with stylus. I'd like to see folders added in the future though as organisation is somewhat frustrating. Update: didn't realise there were notebooks to organise notes, and they work well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like this note taking app which work like a charm on my Samsung Tab S3. But when i intent to move to new Tab s7 i realise there were no sync function with neither Google nor Live, this is forcing me to hunt for other apps. I hope in near future Squid will come back with good sync function with all major cloud service provider. So long."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is user friendly. For latest android version user, it is equipped with back button locking so that our palm will not lead to closing the application unitentionally. But please add the ability to recognize handwiting and Searching menu so that user is able to search his notes easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"B E S T N O T E T A K I N G A P P E V E R!! Micro$oft's OneNote doesn't even come close to Squid. After loosing my work on onenote, i looked for alternatives and since i found Squid, I couldn't be happier. Love this app, that you to the developers, you guys made a gem!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really love this app! Bought premium. However, please add a shortcut to scroll to next page (eg. 3 finger swipe or 2 finger swipe) I'll rate 5 stars if you do so 🙏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome..... Superb app.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Best ever note taking app. Love the eraser feature on Samsung note phone. Great ✌✌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid premium is the best purchase I've ever made for school!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is now the notebook for all my University classes. Allowing me to write on PDFs is one of the features that I really needed. Have multiple templates for different subjects is also very cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi can I ask if you're going to improve the highlighting to go under the text instead of over the text highlighting?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is definitely the best note taking app on Android. There are tons of options for paper type (lined, grid, engineering, sports layouts, etc.) and great options for writing with colors, shapes and lines. Adding pictures and screenshots is very easy. Using it on a Samsung Galaxy Tab with S-Pen is a breeze. I used it for 1.5 semesters of college and absolutely loved it. That's where my biggest issue with the app comes in. There is no syncing of your notes to any account (there is backup and restore, but the functionality is not the same). I had my tablet stolen halfway through this past spring semester and lost all of my notes from the past 1.5 semesters. While I could have backed up the notes, there should seriously be a sync functionality so you can edit notes on multiple devices and even view on a computer. Overall very good app. Just backup your notes (And please add this sync functionality, Steadfast!)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i think this app should be famoussss this is good for taking notes since its quarantine and i also have lots of idea from this app so keep up the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. You should launch this for pc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not the best!!! And for what you ask it should be a whole better!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is one of the best ones I have ever tried but there is a slight issue.. I don't know whether it's coz of the device or stylus that I am using(S pen) but the writing come out to be jaggered and kind of heavily pixelated"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the only thingsquid lack is different kind of pens. overall it is best note taking app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Why it is not full screen for maximum writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just Downloaded this app. Great so far, very easy to learn and navigate. Will give update if anything changes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"really good app. Would be great to have background colors for the all the pages types"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add a stabiliser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Has potential but usability is lacking and improvements VERY slow. Pen, selection tool and eraser need to be on 1st level - switching via menu is awkward! Selections can only be rectangular, no arbitrary shapes (as the selection tool suggests). Attempting to move small selections often resizes them instead - no visual clue what will be happening when starting move gesture at this position. Worst downside for me: no desktop companion!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Not good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good app for taking notes with a stylus. I wish there was an option to scroll with the stylus as well. Edit: Thanks for the comments. I maybe should have checked to see if i could change the settings first. I don't have an active pen, but I could change so scrolling was the default finger action."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Without premium this app is only show of to people. 😑😑"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Dislike lack of page down ability or scrolling without using fingers (smudges screen and accidentally draws)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"How to open backup files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, has everything I'm looking for and more, can also use s pen which is handy. I would highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"SO MUCH GREATEST APP EVER, THANK YOU DEVELOPERS!! BUT UNFORTUNATELY I'M POOR SO JUST USE MOD APK FOR PREMIUM."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for taking notes, filling the documents, drawing, and writing whatever you want. You don't need to buy paper notebooks anymore. You have an infinite paper where you can write as much as you want. You can also sign the pdf documents like you are doing it on paper. I love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Generally nice to use. However the delay in the scrolling of the notes is very distracting. The app makes the handwriting and strokes looks jaggered. Swiping of the screen to move to the nice page maybe nicer than just tapping on the small arrow at the top to scroll through pages. Allowing more organisation options in each notebook would be better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome app! I am a apid subscriber.. WOuld request to make more user freindly shapes and fonts if possible, and an option to scroll easily"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best note taking app I've tried! I've tried many apps across the years. I almost gave up then I saw squid and the premium is worth it. The templates, handwriting option, the select and move option, typing, as well as organization of notebooks are what make this app worth 5 stars! I'd like to suggest a sync feature and to make a macbook and ipad pro version, as well as the option to select pages and move them accross notebooks! I'm excited to see what's more!👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It's been a great and helpful tool throughout my college studies, and it's very likely that I'll use it throughout my career too. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had a few issues in the beginning but thankfully all is corrected now. Thanks to the squid team for their assistance."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi I recently purchased the subscription. The only negative thing ai have to say is pdf viewing and editing is not a pleasant experience here. Can't view pdfs in continues way. Only one page load at once. Pls add continues viewing like on wps office or Adobe"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please give us the option to back upto google drive because most of us use the free 15GB cloud storage from Google not other paid services like Dropbox.Also would appreciate book covers.But overall its a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hello, I'm using this app for quite long already, for my reviews, studies and taking some notes, I subscribed for one full year. I really love this App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app take to much time to download.Please improve it .Other wise all think os good so i am giving 5 star .But improve it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for notetaking on PDF articles. I tried a few before finding Squid and I love that I can underline in different colors, pen width, and strength just like paper. Can highlight too with a range of colors. Lets me jot notes in the margins. Works great with S-pen. Also love the special paper notes since I'm in science -already used polar coordinates. Only minor issue is that pen can delete portions where I swipe but highlight segments only delete as a whole not where I swipe."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best writing app for me so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There is so much potential that you're not yet exploiting, such as rulers, figure creation, character recognition or being able to rotate an image. However the app is good, I know that you're trying to give you're own style and identity to this app. This is possibly the only Playstore App able to compete against the iOS note taking Apps and that's a huge compromise. Well done!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have the upgrade to import .pdf files and between that and inserting pictures from screenshots this has become my go to for online teaching. I couple this with a video program and it's really amazing. I'll be using this for a long time and appreciate the functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add close up writting option. Also add different type of pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app by far. Happy to pay that very small price for all the extras. I like the variety of pages, pens and inputs available. I can upload, edit Pdfs and combine Pdfs among other things. It's really great for the price. The only thing I can think of that would make it better would be a close up writing pad at the bottom of the screen that helps me to write and move across the page automatically. It's tiresome to zoom in and out constantly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"quite convenient! amazing~"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like it, i subscribed for a year. I would only recommend to add more stuff, such as notebooks, more fonts and more pens. It's an amazing app I would totally recommend it to someone using android. Great job guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad update i loss my premium features And i have no time to solve it , as i using it for my work No reason to give us this update"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for writer's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"How do we manage to write so efficiently without a stylus? Is there a trick that I am missing out on?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You can't type with paying... Okay I understand you want money... But this is just ripping off people"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really helps to do excercises in pdf. I use Tab S4 and it is flawless. The premium is cheap and worth it if you use the app often"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I actually bought the upgraded version. I almost never pay for apps. But they can have my 10 bucks a YEAR as apposed to adobe's 15 a MONTH! I use it to do all my docs for school since its literally 100% online now. Being able to edit pdfs and export this is..... a life savior. I was so frustrated sometimes because of formatting issues and being able to edit and send em back to the teacher and this has fixed all that so now its simple and takes almost no time at all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Note taking experience is far better than the other apps. Please only if you can add gesture features like those are available on nebo app 🙄"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is good, but it can improve; Please add Pan and Zoom tool in the app. So giving it only 3 stars as of now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best software"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great and very easy to use. I love it😘"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works better than Samsung Note Pad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Locked in house because of quarantine, couldn't get out to buy stationary. After thinking for 2days and searching on Google Play.. I bought the 1 year subscription. Best note taking app so far, also with very nice of types from single line to maths, sports. Cheaper than notebooks I bought for a year in real life. Pages are also infinite (per note) in this app. Even in free version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent pen functionality with unmatched low-latency and pressure sensitivity. Great for class notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome! My hand doesn't leave extra marks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excelent & reliable!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not at all good please don't waste your time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app alot! Really helped me as a student but one flaws which forced me to give it at 4 star rather than 5....EVERYTHING NEEDS MONEY! I can only use the pen and basic stuff...not even a highliter! Plus I downloaded this app to write on pdfs because Pdf element cost money! But this does too! If you make few things free people would 100% give this is 5 star but anyways this app is really good cause it makes my notes look pretty :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easiest 5 star of my life. This app is the reason I'm passing in university. I literally cannot switch to ios now, this app keeps me hostage on android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, Was wondering if anyone know how to rotate a pdf with this app? So that the texts I input will be right side up. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for the premium, it worked for a month and then it stopped working and Google play says I have already paid the year subscription. I contacted the app developer for help and I got one response saying try the FAQ. I already tried all the solution on the FAQ and still didn't work and I even contacted google and they couldn't help. I am furiously frusterated with this and just wasted 15 dollars and I am a nursing student and was looking forward to incorporating my notes with this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love how this app writes with a stylus. It would be great if it could transform hand made geometric figures to the geometric figure you were trying to made. Either way, it's great and it has a lot of free features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great what it offers for £10 pa"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for drawing, writing, tracing. It's simple and I like that I'm using all of the free tools, and it's easier than learning how to use the Autodesk app. There are some limited free features, so you do have to freehand shapes and lines, but it works for my purposes. There are also different backgrounds like grids, lines, and even colors of your choice. Just wish they have the option of copying and pasting into different files within the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Only single background page available and not useful for PDFs. In a single word very disappointed.use inkreadible app instead of this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Support is really great. Just wish the app had a preset toolbar for different colors and pen sizes. Adjusting it manually can get frustrating if you change it often like I do. I wouldn't mind paying a premium service or buying a package for this option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I used this app to grade a paper and it goes well with a capacitative stylus pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I was happy with Squid until a minute ago it freaking downloaded a ""new version"" from dropbox backup and reverted my entire day of work. Will give -5 if I could. I never hated an app so much."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried ALL of the pen apps .. This is the most user freindly and naturally Intuitive a pleasure to use and not cluttered and over complex... Would love to be able to convert to text with this app.. It would be the best out there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It takes some getting used to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very good and nice app for most useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the app but one thing I'd like to see added is a login option on the app, so that when you log in on a new device all of your work from the previous device is loaded onto the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You cannot even read the pdf without purchasing it, worthless app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My friends, because of you I did not buy an iPad knowing there are great note-taking apps like Goodnotes. Your app is still lacking many funtions like rotating objects/ text/ images, for example. But, despite of everything, you are on the right track! Hopefully you keep adding features to this tremendous app which is very helpful to me as a psychology student! THANKS AGAIN!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app! Need more improvement such as ability to change background colour and finer angle of rotation instead of just 90 degree rotation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There is background colour for blankbackground but for different grids it is not there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad experience it gets hanged in my phone not worth keeping in phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app....no other apps work as smooth as squid.....easiest to use It would be even greater if we could import pdf in its free basic version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just started grad school, and this app has been a life saver for annotating articles. The full version is worth every penny. The only feedback I have would be to have a option to sort and categorize notes. This app has also been helpful in filling out forms for my doctor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. Love the page setting customization. Needs better palm rejection. Adding an option to disable all finger inputs when in app would be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So useful for marketing and returning marked work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"3 years and counting, still love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No searching facility"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesnt have stability when handwriting unlike other digital notebook apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app. The main thing is this app allows free making of unlimited notes while the other good apps don't. Keep it up👍. I would like to suggest you that the highlighter option should be free if possible. It's just a suggestion. Otherwise the best notes app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"fine"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Paying for a highlighter is dope. On the other hand being able to lock the zoom is a rare feature that I think no other app has . Palm rejection is great as well . But the way it processes handwriting makes it look wiggly not sure why . This app lacks a windows desktop version . Edit: I figured out that my lines become wiggly only at the end of a stroke : example: a tick mark , or similar strokes. I wonder if I can view my notes in browser from my windows pc after it's synced to the cloud ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very hard to use uninstalled that day"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this software almost every day on my Pixel Slate to sign real estate deals. I honestly couldn't work without it. Thank you Squid Team!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Drawing functionalility on pixelbook is super smooth and almost lagless. The UI is too geared towards small tablets and phones for a pixelbook. Being able to view the files on a web browser would raise this above the competition. Files are only viewable on a single device without faffy emailing to myself. If competiiton raise their game and make the drawing experience as good, there is nothing really to keep me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Kindly add option of pdd addition for free. App should not charge money recurring but should charge one time money only"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Helped me a lot with my classes. Also, have pages enable for maths. Nice. But, it would be quite awesome if we can read the PDF without paying.edit:can you please add more pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Free the text feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless.. U need to upgrade to premium to use Essential tools (eg. eraser).."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent, it's easy to take note, import and export. In the future, if it can insert file as .doc, .pdf, it is perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It is very good for taking notes, will give higher star if you could allow more view options for pdf annotation such as thu,bnail view, scrolling, or and navigation tool to go to specific pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is good for scribbling notes. For imported PDF documents, it would be nice if text could be selectable and if a continuous scrolling feature could be added. Then it would truly be the ultimate note taking software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the best note-taking apps! This is one of the few apps that don't lag when I take a lot of handwritten notes in a page. Although, it would have been nice if it were a lot more customizable. Allowing the use of local images as pages would be nice : ) Also, it would be superb if we could edit the page names and create hyperlinks to the pages for easier navigation. Thanks a lot for this great app! Looking forward to future improvements : ) !!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has made my life so easy!! What normally takes me 2/3 days took me just a couple of hours. Love you Squid!!! BTW, why do you guys call it Squid?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It would be a lot helpful if vertical scroll is available for pages. It almost feasible to go to one corner and select for page scroll."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for teachers and students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app to take notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not bad. Quite nice. Wow. I did not expect this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I bought the pro version/upgrade on my Kindle fire, I was wondering if I can get the upgrade on this version, or do I need to rebuy it here- no matter what, this is a great app and I highly recommend it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I COULD GIVE YOU 5 Star if its has Book Shelf and turning page like real book ...this tow option exist in moon reader pro and media365 please Add shelf book and turning pages animated and this app will be the best of the best I ready loved it .other app don't have pen easy to use like yours .Regards"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I canceled my subscription because of the longstanding issue of jagged edges on curves that make writing look bad, and for some reason is ignored by the developers despite a lot of people complaining about it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Because of paid...!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I hate how you have to buy premium to get pdf downloaded"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Experience was great. its a great note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is super good for people who use it on tablet. Except it has only one option to make notes that is only drawing. It should have given users a few more features for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Would recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. The subscription is totally worth it for all features. Makes taking notes on Pixel Slate a pleasure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome note app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app use it almost on a daily basis, would love to see an update to viewing style as a book style where you can see two pages at once and have an arrow to go forward or backwards, as an alternative to viewing all the pages at once. But still love the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So much satisfied.. very easy and handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good work! Guys, Love the App. got Premium couple of days ago. It would be nice to have the capability to draw more shapes or add predefined shapes to the sheet. Looking forward to see more improvements. Cheers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for making notes and marking pdf notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I originally gave this 5 stars because it's a fantastic app. I still highly recommend this for any student taking online courses right now due to Covid. The only issue I've encountererd is that your notes don't transfer across devices even if you have the premium version. I'd like to be able to access my notes and journals on both my laptop and my cell phone since I don't have my laptop all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Completely and utterly fantastic!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is amazing. Can this be used in desktop (windows10)? Can I do the editing in desktop?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really great. Writing on it with the finger produces the most legible notes out of any I've tried. I wish you didn't have to go into settings to choose a colored page. Desperately needs a drag and drop note sorting function. Overall great app though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"बेकार में भी श्रेस्ट ऐपलीकेशन है"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Downloaded for the express purpose of marking up PDFs, as one would believe this app is capable of, based on the title, ""take notes and markup PDFs,"" only to find that such a feature is behind a paywall. Terrible bait and switch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Add page rotation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far so good, it's very easy to use, and so far seems dependable. Something thing I'd love to see added 1. Folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice. I am a teacher and it is very usefull for me. I suggest you all to purchase it ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Vertical scrolling and folders would be nice features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When it comes to actually taking notes, marking up PDFs, or just drawing, Squid is fantastic. I use it constantly on my chromebook with an EMR stylus and it works great. My only issues are the pixelation that comes when I chromecast a document, and the fact I have to manually backup and restore my documents to share them on another chromebook. Other than these inconveniences, this is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish this app had one time purchase for premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love using this for highlighting and writing on scientific papers as I read. Also good for general notetaking or jotting down to-do lists. Good options for pen or highlighter thickness, as well as colors"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think it's good for children to make the notes digitally...loved this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Gotta pay to import PDF , complete waste of time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for reviewing and marking up PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I started using this app to take notes in class one day when I forgot to bring a pen but I had my tablet and s-pen. I love that I can back up my notes to my online storage and that my notes are accessible. I can easily share my notes as a pdf with a classmate. And, I can import pictures and screenshots of textbook pages right into my notes. One of my favorite apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Have been using it for nursing school and it has made a world of difference for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When I take notes on top of photos, once exported to pdf the notes show up under the photos. This just started happening last month or so."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for making critical quick notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Flexible"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not bad. Please be aware of your competitor's progress. Where is HANDWRITING to TEXT recognition? ERASING could be so much faster and extremely convenient just by adding an erasing gesture like crossing out the word or something similar. SIDE BY SIDE comparison, editing and notes taking of two docs would also be a fantastic feature. I've just paid and downloaded Nebo almost exclusively for their handwriting to text recognition so please think hard about those features or any other suggestions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent, invaluable. Folders within folders would be helpful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's very good. But too expensive 😫"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've had this app on my phone for a long time and it's pretty great. Whenever I want to just jot a little note down or sketch out an idea I use this because I can quickly put down whatever I want just like on real paper, rather that being constricted to text and a few premade shapes and lines. Also I know this isn't really an art app but please add layers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App, extreamly useful for everyday use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The general idea if fine but some basic features are missing. Can not copy and paste or duplicate separate notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love this app more than Evernote/one note. Its intuitive but still has a plethora of features. I wish I could access my account and notes from other devices and mark particular slides as important, as a med student I may have to scroll through 100+ slides. Marking/starring important slides to refer back to later would be awesome. Love the app and I look forward to giving it a complete 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it's a good app but can you pls add a dark mode ?it will be easy to use at night then"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm a paid subscriber, and i want to read long pdfs and books on here. The experience of flipping pages MUST be improved"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I paid for the subscription with little hesitation in mind. This was my first subscription in play store either. I am completely satisfied with the tools for my work. Easy to manage and edit with stylus pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can you please include Google Drive as one of the options for cloud backups?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Unabashedly recommended. Nothing comes close. Thanks for creating a wonderful product that really isa perfect companion for a stylus tablet. I just wonder if there's some improvement in smoothing up the pen strokes. Especially for lower resolution tablets. Sometimes the strokes can be bit jaggy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"SABBAS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add the option where we can export only custom pages to pdf. With the options available we can either export all pages and one single page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"💯💯♥️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I paid for the pdf import version. Work well so far as per my expectation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app will be complete if it gets layers tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to purchase the ability to import pdf files but it's advertised as an app to ""mark up"" pdfs..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really liked this app ,in fact I even use this app for drawing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome note taking app, using the tools provided makes for a very neat note taking experience!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy with the handwriting and draw pictures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program, pen use is easy and instinctual, writes true to my writting, like paper. I love the templates and ability to add pages where I need them. I do wish I could have 2 files open side by side. In order to look at one note while working on another, I either have to flip back and forth, or print a hard copy of one. I wish I could back up to google drive or one drive, or a squid cloud. I do not like dropbox or box, or that it does not save as a squid file that I can edit on other dev"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app for android definitely give a try. 1 star less because in dark mode only blank page is available"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great experience of writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't import PDF at the moment. The window automatically closes down itself. In the middle of pandemic this app gave me a lot of hope with online teaching. Now it seems like a mess."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's a good app, can't premium tools be used by watching ads? I won't have any problems on watching ads &then using premium tools:) but purchasing them isn't easy for me & many :( I've those tools at my home a& I can also write on them & use apps like Microsoft Lense instead of using any app but I wanna do it directly on my tab:( I had one app which was so good even there were many tools(including highlighter) but I wanted this app only so I deleted it:( Please please please think about it!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It is very good. Unfortunately, the free version does not accept the use of pdf."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Who do I talk to about suggestions? I have a suggestion for one of the sport things?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Is there any good app that you handwrite notes on the app and then it turns it into digital notes for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helps me with my knitting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for taking notes, Just that if they could add the cloud version in the free plan."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Using the free version and liking it (but it lacks more pens, brushes...). Good to use with my S Pen (Note 10+). Finally I can choose paper size in an app like this and share perfectly as PDF. I was ready to upgrade to premium and abandon Samsung Notes... BUT... only then I found that I have to use Dropbox or Box to sync my notes. Unacceptable. Sorry."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app with every essential thing needed👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best, i like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for paperless function 🤩"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have been using Squid for years and I can't imagine life without it. There are two improvements I would like to see. The biggest one for me would be native syncing between devices. Usually I try to take notes on my tablet whenever possible but sometimes I just don't have time to get it out or can carry it with me so I use my phone. There is backup/restore which can kind of work as synching but you have to manually do it on both devices before and after. The 2nd is a checkmark shape for lists."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app, helped me so much for solving past papers, I love it ♥️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So Box and Dropbox are the only clould backup options??? This sillyness would have to be corrected in order for me to recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great and versatile note-taking app. Simple and effective."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GOOD"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Wish it has zoom (magnifier) function with auto advance, like goodnotes 5 has, inkredible ink has, etc... Its imposible to zoom the paper all the time. Yes, zoom the page has its good, but With zoom (magnifier) and auto advace, the paper will auto sync with my writing, no need me to pan the page all the time. If you have this option, you deserves 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the cast option works with my old samsung tab 10.1 2014 android 4.4.2 and new Sony Bravia 70in smart tv thanks..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best writing app out there, love it! No problems or complaints... and I'm picky! Edit: 6 years later, my opinion hasn't changed...it's been on all my Galaxy Notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not perfect but it gets the job done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super versatile app and excellent customer service. Perfect for Note phones."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It does not let me scrol out if i do it does not work i HATE it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"when I buy a tool in the squid app is it mine forever?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app, I've been using premium, but suddenly can't. I followed instructions in faq, but still don't have premium back. If i try to upgrade again, it gives me an error that i already have premium. If i try to import a file, it pops up for me to buy premium. When i try to, I get the same error that i already have premium. This is a great app, but i will have to find something else if i can't get premium back. I even uninstalled and reinstalled after restarting my device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful for my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good but there is scope to be perfect! The non-availability of sections/labels within Notebooks is a major flaw but one that can be easily fixed! Making all their tools easily accessible is another issue. Otherwise it's a great app for note taking!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Writing and pages option are great. Areas requiring improvement - 1. Pen styles. Calligraphy, pencil, colour brush, crayon world be a great addition for better notes. 2. Ability to change ruling colour. 3. Option to lock the movement of the page on palm touch. Every now and then, it's slightly difficult to write with S Pen. Palm moves the page. 4. More shapes - hollow and solid. 5. Handwriting to text conversion option. 6. Very important, page scrolling shows background pixel"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice app but ask money for basic functions like cloud backup 😌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I hate that the most important feature to me require squid premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Im creating great videos with pages. I really wish for more improvement for it as well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app ever i've experienced..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Dangerous and not doing what it should do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻💯💯💯💯"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice idea. No glitches."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app feels very natural, and over all it's very usable. So why the 2-star? Well, the backup system is extremely unreliable! I paid for the subscription, enabled cloud backup to dropbox (or so i thought)... yesterday i had to powerwash my pixel slate, and to my disappointment, after coming back to squid, it keeps saying couldn't find previous backup!! I contacted support, and they asked if i enabled backup provider, and ""check the appropriate box"" ... so enabling backup is not enough??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best note taker and pdf writing app. I only miss the ability of search by text inside pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its excellent. Would give it a 4.5 though. Have been trying to purchase the premium version, but keep having issues with Gpay, each time i use my master card and enter my details, it keeps saying ""correct card info or try a different card"". I have searched and searched for solutions online but to no avail. I have not been able to do cloud backup of my important notes because of this constraint and i am also deprived of other very good features of the premium version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing, so many different page formats to choose from even without buying the subscription. If there was one thing that could be nice would be having more 'Pen' options to choose from. But otherwise great !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like using Squid but reading the info would lead someone to think that more features come with the free squid only to find out nearly all of features & options come with paid version but still it's a descent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, useful app for annotating pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app and very intuitive. The only problem is that it doesn't support automatic backup with Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When it works it's good, but I paid for premium and it keeps dropping my premium subscription, I contacted squid support and they blamed google, their tech support is automated horrible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for a bullet journal and for storing of my school articles while annotating on them. I would suggest"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"a really great app, lots of paper sizes and designs and super simple interface and easy to use! however, i wish the dotted paper was available to regular free users and also that there were a few more brush/pen options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amooo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. I use it to do window surveys on site and place orders. Its perfect 10/10"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super . Best working app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app for taking app with actually a good interface I think 3 stars is more than enough for this app. Need to be updated with feature My suggestion is that it will have more downloads if it will be free for a few months so that it will have more regular users and then it can make this app premium . And then it will have more out of this app..😄😀😃😁😆"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"बहुत ही शानदार ऐप है और ऑनलाइन अध्यापन के लिए बहुत ही सहयोगी व महत्वपूर्ण है इसके उपयोग से अध्यापन सहज व सुगम संभव हुआ है मैं इसका प्रयोग कर रही हूं और बहुत संतुष्ट हूं मैं ऐप के निर्माता की सराहना करती हूं और तहे दिल से शुक्रिया भी अदा करती हूं"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Totally trash. Just want money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it! I just wish you could have at least added more options or selections of tools in the free version such as highlighters.Nevertheless, it's a great app for note-talking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Improve service this black board Background black please provide"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect writing experience on chromebook with stylus."

( Mind Blown💨) Okay..you need to buy some backrounds , but it's fine! , I will plan to purchase it in future but for now..I will wait.. I have ordered a new stylus pen , specially for this app.. I hope it will work! Thank you soo soo soo soo soo much for this app We need more developers like these!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing functioning Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great screen sensitivity!! Awesome for notes and lists! Good choice of paper types and colors. Only thing I don't like is you have to swipe too delete and that takes some getting used to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the smoothest Android note-taking app I've tried. Even though the pen tool is so accurate, it's hard to keep your handwriting neat."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great, I have no complaints so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have the subscription version on my Samsung tablet and I love it. However, that tablet is old and I am using a Windows convertible now. If you can please have a Windows version I would gladly pay for it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could be better if you provide highlighter option for free mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app ....❤️❤️❤️❤️ Plz never make it any paid feature❤️❤️❤️❤️ Plz best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad ,, goodnote is better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Closest thing to a SmartBoard for my Calculus I-III students while we're stuck at home elearning! Love shapes menu and PDF markup features so I purchased those features. Base version of Squid is great, but that's all I need. There's also specialty paper backgrounds for advanced math or music or sports as well as a text import feature. It's great that you can purchase these addons for a reasonable one time fee so you don't have to subscribe with a monthly fee if you don't want to!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good . like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless without paying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is very good notepad it is easy to make note suddenly one negative thing is we can't can erase the word we want, we want to clear the entire page but it is a good notebad🕣"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please bring this for Windows as well! 🙏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for note taking!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its great to be honest. My tab has the pro version but so far it doesn't have palm recognition. Hope you add this in the next update."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gajjab ka hi ye app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the most amazing note-taking app I have ever used. I am using it for planning my masters thesis, making summaries for exams and online teaching. 100% recommend this app! I can't even decide on my favorite feature - everything is just brilliant :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its so stupid like you have to pay to have text to have shapes and so much more i thought this was promising but NO they are never. Some people cant pay digitally so why limit there choices HUH! I need an explanation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall nice. Sometimes my pen does not work properly near the edges. Not sure if program related or tablet. Would be nice to give individual titles to pages within one note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"How can I make copy a notebook?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Of all the note taking platforms this, personally speaking, has the best note taking experience. It's great for studying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Though Deleting multipe pages at once would be way more efficient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app sits my needs very much. I am able to take notes efficiently. I am even making a book with pictures and such. I highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All right! Finally a good Android notes app to handwrite Please add more tools, so its not just pen and highlighter, but maybe ruler, brush, or literally anything so it would be a lot more interesting and worth more for the yearly/monthly subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.. works well for work to edit docs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Only works with pdf files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Too many add-ons for a cost!😥"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best app for note taking due to the various templates, paper sizes and tools available. Was contemplating on getting a subscription but now that I have, no regrets because it really simplifies the process of note taking. However I wish that there is an update that provides an array of pen so that we don't have to constantly change the settings when we wish to switch to a different coloured pen or a highlighter. Aside from that, I wish that background colours are available for all paper types"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"אין אפשרות לשלב טקסט מוקלד . מבאס"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for use on my S6 tablet with stylus. I keep lots of notes for work and I'm able to amend and highlight as I'm going. Plus its easy to keep it all seperate from the few personal notes I keep"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add folders/divider features and enable sync option to access in between different devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great overall. would request an infinite page length with fixed page width"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I THOUGHT I got this free with my chromebook, but it wouldn't let me import PDFs without paying, but it's cheap so whatever. I'm loving it. I downloaded the passion planner PDF pages for free, use this app to do my daily journaling, and I absolutely love it. Crashes occassionally, and I wish there was some type of palm rejection when I'm using stylus but not even sure if that's possible. All the premium features are great too, love the highlighter, and importing pdf. Well designed also. Worth it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super. Excels in long form lecture notes. Can write and paste graphics etc. Flexible page layout and pdf output seals the deal. My go to app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app has so much potential but it's sad to see that developers are so ignorant. On the feature request website there are so many topics/requested ideas that are heavily voted but they're being ignored. Recently none of those topics have even been considered, there are no replies from developers even on the ones that are more than a year old. It's sad to see such ignorance on such a good app(& also a paid app). I don't want to see this becoming outdated like a lot others on play store."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yeah I loved it. This is amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app, I like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Early Review...So far so good. I am looking to see how to sync across all my devices (tablet, phone, computer)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app helpful in making notes in your tab.....using a stylus to use ur tab as a copy.... I love it. Thank u"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is best for making education videos. It also has option to add images."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use to sign Documents"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for student"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent, I would like to buy it rather than just rent it, but I suppose Adobe's business model is too tempting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great notebook app. Easy to use, I can send everything to the cloud easily. I use it often"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"While this is a nice simple note taking app, it really needs a password/PIN/fingerprint option. Different pen options would also be nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best app for android note taking there is out there. The prices are a bit high, but I like how you can choose to only buy certain features so you don't have to waste all your money buying the full version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app, does what its suppose to do. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's the best notetaking app I use in my tab s4. The glitches mostly appear when I use the pressure sensitive pen and when I insert images. I would like for it though to have the freehand crop option for images, font styles in texts, and the handwriting window. The handwriting recognition should really improve as well. I'm really hoping for this app to improve in the future since there's no goodnotes in android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Integration between materials (pdfs, inserted notes, etc) help speed up the process for review and reference."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been great for taking notes. I love all the different types of note sheets you can choose from."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty God👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app works well for note taking (lectures or memos to self). I would have loved some line based input style as in the unfortunately discontinued handrite-app, but Squid also works well. The option to purchase some features individually and permanently (e.g. pdf import) is a bit hidden, but it is there and it's nice - I really dislike continued dependencies like sobscriptions. I will continue to use Squid: no better alternatives."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its not all good for a phone I can't write anything with my hand I cant note anything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it in my S Pen shortcuts instead of notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Need premium upgrade to import pdf?!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for notetaking, and compiling documents in one place. It makes my classes so much easier. It also just makes communication and writing in general so much easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for writing on PDFs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only app you need for your tab s6"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great for handwriting and pdf markups. But is it hard to add CONTINUOUS SCROLLING, in view-only mode at least? Not convenient to read pdf files."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can you please add Drive to sync providers?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the app exactly what I was looking for. I just wish some stuff was free but it's ok. The only problem I have is sometimes when erasing it glitches, but I think it's just because my tablet. Would strongly recommended. Erasing is good on phone btw."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"everything else is perfect but it needs a dark Mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm impressed it is so smooth for my low specs tablet, highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is super fluid and by far better than other alternatives such as one note and Adobe acrobat definitely recommend the paid version if you need a pdf markup/note taking tool. Goes great with my brand new galaxy tab s6"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is simple, stable and amazingly productive! As an online educator, I love it. It solved a problem I faced when I was using Microsoft's OneNote, the problem of lack of paper sizes option! With Squid, you can set any paper size you want, lots of backgrounds from which you can choose to customize how your page looks like, etc!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only suggestion I can give is for u to add a dark theme for the app and if you can add a small rectangle for us to write in instead of zooming in for the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent 1st use with University lecture. Very easy to use and create amazing content. Complete game changer for my note taking. Would love to see sync between devices as well as removing the paper background on mass for each notebook and the PDF exports. Would be 5 stars with those features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for digital writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App is useless without $$$, please I suggest ,,, I want to give you the opinion that you should not download this app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good app for taking notes with stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a fantastic application for note-taking, especially for jotting down points in lectures. It provides both college-ruled pages as well as mathematical grids and is completely free to use. I particularly like the ability to set the page size to A4 and export my notes as a PDF. Would highly recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I can do a lot of my university notes here ❤️☺️ and I can share on pdf"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is what i was looking for. Good hand writing, simple and intuitive menu, pdf manipulation, sync etc. My only problem with squid is that its not cross platform."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for several years and still haven't seen anything better. I'm a contractor and this is the best note pad possible and does basic office layout. You gotta give it a try."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app.. I wish it can also accommodate typed notes along with the Handwitten notes. Your deserve all the stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app has many tools and options sometimes free good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would have given 5 stars if insert option would have been provided. Cut and paste option should be made available from. Pdf. It has to be developed like flexcil for iPad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very good and helpful app specially for students. it could be better if add some animation in changing pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outstanding app. I use it as a PhD research student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I cannot download this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good for my uni notes!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"4 stars for its simplicity. I would prefer nicer interface and by that I mean to let me put covers on my notes and colors to my collections to distinguish each other"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I have tried many note taking apps, this is by far my favorite free note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good it works well for me and it is quivk ń easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad app don't install"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be 5 stars if we could rotate text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App is USELESS without $$$. Don't download! Writing on or importing pdfs is paywalled. The app only allows you to create notes unless you wanna pay $6.49 CAD. Why would I use the app for only note-taking, when natively installed apps are better optimized to my device? Sneaky and shady business practice. Don't market it as ""free"" and then charge customers for the only unique thing about this app. All the stuff this app is supposed to do for free my pre-installed note app does better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. It has helped me with my school documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its really compact and easy to use. I am really enjoying it's features.Works amazing. Even my team and classmates says the same thing.Our teachers appreciated the well presentation. And easy accessablity. I have been trying note taking apps for some time now.But nothing satisfied me as much as squid did. Especially the multiple style for pages option.Thank you.It's also a great alternative for paper medium. And a good way to help mother earth.Only problem is with the tool switch. Which takes 🕦"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it was fake it showing in the play store images GRID view, but in Real it is LINE view"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's unforgivable the fact of the app doesn't have option to organize the notes. It doesn't offer any option to create folders. I bought the premium version and I can't do this. It's a good app but there is a long time last time it was updated in order to implement new features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"👌👌👌👌👌👌👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best program for importing and edite files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The Type is a premium feature?! Are you kidding me?!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its changed note taking and collaboration for me completely. I love it. I'm just using the basic app with a few purchased features and its awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic stuff"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything works pretty smoothly, from export/importing to writing experience. My only gripe is the selection tool, it's a bit wonky and selects stuff outside the border I drew. Overall experience is fine."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There are some things paid which would be better if some of them were free.........."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am terrible at keeping track of paper. With the S-pen and Squid I never lose an idea."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I didn't like that you had to pay for the tool pack. I mean who wants to pay for a text tool! What about the people who don't have touch screen! I really think they should change that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bhut badiya"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome...it will be really great it they add all thr Features of goodnotes 5 too..... please add them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app. I use it every day for general note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far I have had a great experience with Squid. With that being said, the one thing I wish it allowed us to do is to add a pdf document to a current Note, instead of having to start a new Note to add with a new pdf document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Stylus works well on Chromebooks, but automatic backups cripple the app (especially as you accumulate lots of notes), preventing pasting of images, and I see no way to cancel them once they start. Unintelligent backup-exporting of PDFs also an issue - unchanged files should be ignored. Badly needs a dark mode. Bottom-line, the app is fairly stagnant - no significant upgrades in a very long time. I'm reconsidering my subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Asaam ki chat mast hai"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For me really the best handwriting note taking app on android."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome 👍 found out how to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Need better way to organize notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Considerably better than most note apps for Android, including the built-in Samsung Notes, which has been made less functional over the years."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Requires subscription for basic features (like drawing a line). No one time purchase model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The Galaxy Note phones and the Surface Books are the devices of choice for me now. For Their Great Handwriting Capabilities. Squid is a fantastic handwriting app, but after these many years it still can't be synced between the two devices. Therefore I seldom use it anymore and for that reason lower my rating to 2. Give me syncing, the rating will go up to 5. Doug"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I dislike the interface. I really dislike that it takes three taps to swap from pen to eraser and another three to get back. Why would you not just have separate buttons for these tools? Changing the thickness of the pen requires millimetre precision; why not have an opinion to type the size or have adjustment buttons, rather than play a game of chance where the answer changes when you raise your finger? I'm just so angry after 20 minutes of trying to use this thing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No Full screen mode🙄🙄 In Landscade mode Status bar and navigation bar covers the pages and display section smaller. Please add full screen mode hiding status bar and nevigation bar in landscape mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using it for school work and in absolute recommend it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does everything for notetakers. It doesn't crash on my chromebook, and I really likethe feature for adding pages to a section. Typing can be a little to get used to but overall highly reccomended. Previous note apps I have used in the past: OneNote Evernote I am a medical student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for annotations and etc ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"If it supported handwriting recognition/conversion to text it would be a five star app. Its crazy to me that it doesn't after all this time, particularly when its a subscription based service."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"First time I've used a writing app and this one seems very good. Easy to use and no ads. Exactly what I was looking for. Top marks to the developers. 5 stars, easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Endless uses Love the templates!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please bring dark mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I didn't expect the app would charge me just to insect a PDF document. Also, since I don't prefer touching a screen with my finger, I wished I could change the setting, so that I can scrol with my pen. I would consider paying for premium if I had a chance to try out premium features with a trial. At this point, I am unhappy with the app so uninstalling it. compared to Goodnotes on IOS, this app seems to be far more inferior."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Even basic features are paid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is so handy & easy to use. I love the flexibility of formatting, fonts and special forms. Great app. I've used it for years. Haven't found anything better. Perfect app for jotting quick notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Writing is very smooth, but tool selecting and color changing is pain, all options are under one single tab, very inconvenient for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am using to make notes on my Google Pixelbook for university math classes. Great tool, does exactly what I need it to do as a student. Make sure your stylus doesn't have any buttons near the writing tip, though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish I could have subfolders for organizing my notes. Used it as a student for all my uni notes. Perfect app in all other regards."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I want this in fullscreen mode so that tools can hide. And we will get more space for writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Shapes can't be moved or deleted with eraser. I cancelled within 1 mins of using pro as its awful, can you refund me please?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this application on my Samsung Tab S6 for several months. It's an awesome application that does everything advertised smoothly and seamlessly. I couldn't be more pleased."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking lecture notes and submitting handwritten coursework (I'm a physics student) as PDFs. Would definitely recommend, use it on my Samsung Tab S6 and is flawless, will look to purchase some premium features in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"4.5 stars, but I rounded up for my rating here. Squid is fantastic for taking notes! I've been using it to take notes in meetings at work, since I prefer to handwrite my notes but don't want to waste paper. Additionally, I'm also using it to take notes in some of the courses I'm taking over the summer, and the ability to import and mark up pdfs has been a lifesaver. Docked half a star for occasional freezing and crashing, but it's not a significant issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it is really helpfull it is helping me get better grades in math"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favourite note-taking and doodling app! Works wonderfully with my galaxy note stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a writer who has tested several different handwriting applications, and this one is by far the best. You can change the size of the page to any standard size (A4, letter, etc.) So it doesn't expand infinitely. You can export files as a PDF, and print them with good quality. It also boasts nice file organization and pen features. Also, handwriting is very smooth. Premium is definitely worth it as well, as you get some more functionality out of the app. In general: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Dont dow load it as when we try to write eomething it gets almost scribbled ...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app If I could afford a paid version I'd love to try out all the other tools too!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely one of my favorite apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app! Very user friendly and it is so much surprised that I can make it short cut here and there. Thank you very much for making my life easier and saving a lot of my time 🤩🤩🤩"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Too multi-clicking tools access since 2012!!! Pages continuous scrolling is absent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Wow...What a crappy app with no functions at all. Immediately uninstalled it. Hate Squid App."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I subscribed thinking it would be possible to change the text font. It isn't?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi squid developers. I can't thank you enough for this app. It helped me a ton with my studies. Though there are some thing that I would want to see in future updates: 1. Dark mode. Not just for the app but kind of like a dark background for notes, too. 2. The ability to combine notes. And in general, more organizing features. I import all of my lecture notes for math, bio, chem etc and some of them are given to me in separate pages every week. So I would like to have a single note and add the new page every week. I know that I can do this outside of squid but it would save me a lot of time if I didn't have to. 3. Adding pictures from web pages more easily?! 4. Having some default colors for quick access. 5. Recording the Lectures...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for my maths practice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cloud storage would be cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the world's best app for digital world.. Thanks a lot for keeping our world Greener.....love you team squid...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid turns my Tablet into a Digital Notebook!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"a need color dropper, pleeeease 😭😭😭"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outstanding! Does what it's supposed to - easiest note taking app without a million bells and whistles, which are mostly never used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be perfect if there were some or more handrwriting correction. Even if you have a high-res screen it is a tad annoying. The functionality though, just amazing.And Google Drive backup support would be nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent performance on my Samsung Chromebook Plus. Favorite features so far: high line fidelity, low latency; infinite canvas; PDF export, supports Chrome OS's stylus menu ""create note"" shortcut; everything I need in the free version, makes me want to buy if only to support devs. I'll likely add more later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I think this app has potential. But there has been no meaningful update. There are so many features that are missing when compared with Notability. For example in highlighter tool press and hold should give you a straight line or highlighter should snap to text automatically. Same with pen tool. It is very inconvenient to highlight and annotate as highlighter is all over the place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"One of the primary functions in the title, pdf markup, is a paid feature in a free app. This is bait and switch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cons: in app purchases, cannot use all tools without them, cannot upload pdf's without the purchases, definitely room for improvement with already accessible software. Pros: helpful for taking hand written notes and drawing figures, I enjoy using it to minimize wasting paper while brainstorming"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I will compare it here with Samsung Notes. I give samsung Notes 9 out of 10 , and squid 7 out of 10. main thing missing here , variety of pens , and if image was inserted there must be a Long press to select it. i'm still invistigating. will update accordingly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Squid is a pretty mediocre note taking app. The only redeeming quality is the ability to import PDF's and be able to write on them, which makes it decent for university notetaking. The premium service for this app is pretty ridiculous and not worth it, considering OneNote has far more funictionality and polish for students. In addition to this, I've had issues with my notes saving properly in the squid app, and squid doesn't offer instant cloud syncing through their own app, only 3rd Parties."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, I use it for taking notes and I use the import pdf feature often. Highly recommend this app for people like me who don't like to print slides in paper to make notes but want the flexibility of being able to scribble notes on pdfs to you heart's content."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a really good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"For pdf inport you must pay 5.5€ ...just so you know people..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app regularly. It works very well!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love writing and scribbling in this app. love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Everything is chargeable, even those which are easily available in other applications."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. very friendly to use and upload to your phone and devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"there should be other pen / pencil functions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"PLEASE ADD the ability to rotate PDFs. PLEASE and Thank You."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Every stylus owner must have this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good. Wished i could write comments on pdf docs for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good, just would like some fixed size music staffs with measures, some fixed size notebook paper would be cool too.... infinite scrolling is cool but not when you scroll and cant find stuff. I like it alot though and can work around the quirks. good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"😃"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is super easy to use. I use it at university to cut down on paper and keep all my notes in one place week to week. I find it much easier to write the notes using my pen with the laptop rather that type notes (typing notes can sometimes be loud in class). I just wish the sync feature would work with the other devices I have, for example accessing the notes I made on my computer on my phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not recommended for landscape mode. It doesn't hide the android status bar. The tool bar is very big on top. So very less space is available for writing. Can you please place the tool bar on the side in landscape mode? Also please make it full screen. It's really a deal breaker for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great. smooth. remarkable fast."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's fantastic. Only thing I would wish for is collaborative documents with other squid users!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its okay but to enjoy it you have to do the paid version. Thanks. Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love the interface I love the options to choose page grids different paper styles. What I hate and what ruins the experience for me. using the S-Pen when I click on the side it gives me the option to lasso things it should be an eraser. The Eraser is my finger. So if I use one finger to try and scroll up on the page I end up erasing a whole bunch of work and have to press the back button. Additionally erasing with my finger is Clumsy and it's very hard to be accurate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"There are very few options are available for free, many options are paid version.. In playstore many free apps are available..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is not the worst app but if you want to type you have to pay money I think that is unfair you can only draw with your finger or pen I hope you guys can fix this 😞 . Other from that it is a ok app 😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to Mark up on PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app for samsung galaxy note series"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. The reason for me to still buy Samsung tablets. Note to developers: a simple option to duplicate a note would benefit me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've only been using this app for a week but I've already paid for Premium. Definitely worth using if you have a tablet or phone with an accurate stylus. I used to bullet journal in expensive notebooks but since finding this app, I've migrated everything over. Reasonable price for premium unlocks useful tools"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app! Is absolutely perfect for students. Honestly should be installed as a main feature for Chrome OS. Only complaint is that oftentimes the app will freeze and crash with no clear reason why/fix. Hope they fix this soon, I use Squid for everything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There are many features can be add such as searching for a word"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice for taking notes and doing homework in my math class, works good with the galaxy note series because of the pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice Notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Signed up for the subscription and it's not bad at all, but it's lacking so many things!! I need to be able to rotate shapes and lines, and I need more types of pencils and brushes! Please add all those things and you'll get 5 stars for sure!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish there were more options in the basic package like the graph paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I always want to lie to myself by thinking I don't love this app but I do love it. It just works well for the things you need it to work for on a phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply brilliant, brilliantly simple"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried a few options for note-taking apps and settled on this. It is definitely very intuitive and feature-full when actually taking notes in real-time. I use it for meetings and drawn visualizations for videos."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app for note taking and explaining stuff on the fly. Synergizes well with samsung S pen screen write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Lags when scrolling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Vey helpfull app and fınd all want need to get work done,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is simply the *best* note-taking app for chromebooks. I love it. However, I wish it had more than one font to choose from (in its premium version) and collaborative editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good product"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Garbage, wasted my money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good for what it is but I personally don't use it a lot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app, I just wish there was a way for me to have more than one pdfs open at the same time so I could just tab out and open one and the other simultaneously"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app has definetly improved since I downloaded it, but it still has it's glitches and can be frustrating at times. Overall, I do like the app and the problems can be easily looked over."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works great, a bit of a learning curve to figure out all the features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app for taking notes....."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Anyone else having issues restoring purchases?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There's a lot of functionality here. I love the ability to bring in PDFs and images, mark them up, and export them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! My daughter can do her work as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add page screen recording feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Experience has been great so far, but why when you want to add a page, it only adds forwards not backwards. And will any new pen types be added soon ??? Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"by far its the best note taking app on Android, me & my friends use samsung tabs to take notes & write on pdf files. Flaws: 1) There is no folder option, it would be great if we could arrange lecture notes in subfolders. Also i pay for this app, atleast they should allow this. 2) the automatic backup is only limited to dropbox, like Google drive or One drive is not in the list. Also there is no automatic sync, i use it on my phone & tablet, but i have to sync by restoring the backup everytime."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have fallen in love with this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"All the useful features are locked behind a paywall. Why would I download an app for PDFs that when free can only act as a (bad) drawing app. Can't even import PDFs unless you subscribe. I'd rather buy it then subscribe for it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent & thank u"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good, but some improvements would be welcome. Several suggestions are ignored"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have a Pixelbook and this is the only app available for annotating/note taking. It's definitely great and is fun and easy to use. The only thing i don't like is that i have to zoom in to the maximum in order for it to write nicely - but that might be my amazon pen's fault lol. I also wish we could make ""notebooks"" within notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool. Will be better if we can send squid notes between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for chromebooks, but doesn't work great on split screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app to use with my Note 4 stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing. I have it on all my devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"They do not allow you to use a proper eraser unless you pay. Free eraser remove parts of drawing instead of area you touch so you need to start that parts drawing again from the beginning. Fortunately many good apps out there allow that without being forced to pay for basic features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than SNote.. just the automatic backups that don't work seamlessly.. (they are scheduled to work every night but they don't always happen)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app. that's the thing which I want. good job developers....👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good ... Useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not premium version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great for reading and marking pdfs with a stylus. I wish it had a feature for bulk download and export, so I could use it for grading papers. Right now you can only download or export one item at a time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use this app for school notes. I DL the PPTX and convert to PDF. With this app I can draw on the pdf slides. Works fantastic. Although... I don't use a pen and literally just draw with my finger. You can also drop images in if you're not a strong artist. Just wish it had the function of selecting a box OR circle OR drawn area, to modify opaqueness. That its only flaw. Great app for chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for drawing, writing, note taking , etc. I wish Squid was available for iOS. I would pay big money for it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Just still need some minor enhancement, when attach PDF, still can't rotate after insert, the rest working fine. I love this app. Would like to know when Squid can solve this issue?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best noyebook apps i have used. Tons of different options to choose from. I really liked being able to choose my paper size and type."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"allow more fluent hand writting and add an option to quickly the matter over the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app. Pricing is quite high though, if you opt for the subscription way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been searching many apps for taking notes for my galaxy tab and I think squid is the best apps out there. I use squid for school and all features I need is there. From drawing shapes to make table and easy way to add photos, I think upgrading to premium is a must. But the only thing that I think needs to be upgraded is the way to scroll the page is slow I don't know it's repairable or not but I dont like the way it comes out as boxy first then it becomes normal. But overall the apps is good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"squid is the best option we have, period. But in some cases, it could be su much better. -utilise the s-pen as best as possible (other optimalization stuff) -let us have favourite pens and colours so we can browse trough them with the s-pen button for a much quicker switch -it sometimes feels a bit off, Samsung notes gives a much better writing experience for me, idk how to put this in useful terms -overall redesign with night mode? (this just my opinion, far from a must do)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app. Probably the best for android hence I paid for the subscription. But not having sync to Google drive or One drive is one of it downfall. At least that is the most common cloud. The amount of pen type can also be improved."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite! I use this more than Microsoft. I recommend it to all my family, friend, & coworkers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Been using it for revision notes at university. Only one tiny thing that bothers me and it's the inability to actually swipe left and right on to different pages. You have to press arrows instead. Would highly love to have this feature added, but other than that, would 100% recommend!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Two requests: 1. Add a dotted line pen. 2. I'd like a black background option. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great and does everything I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good app for drawing notes, brainstorming for Chrome OS. What i love most is the infinity board which allows me to just keep on drawing and brainstorm + zoom in with 2 fingers. Im on the paid version. What i would suggest to add is more friendly ways to access the tools. Its ok, but can be improved. Tqs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid has helped me take my lessons online for digital learning. I am able to cut and paste commonly misunderstood problems from Khan Academy, IXL, pdf, Delta Math, and Schoology into a page and immediately annotate & correct the misconception. Upon completion of our meeting I can send a copy of our notes to everyone in the group through email, or post to my drive/class files. Next, I will attempt to screen record while annotating a problem set for asynchonous learning."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good note taking app, but few modern utilities. Need a lot of quality of life additions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app was great and i was actually considering to buy the premium version but i was hoping if you could at least put some more tools such as calligraphy pens and such for creative purposes...so the lack of tools makes me hesitant to buy this so pls cuz this would really help lots of student like me and i love your app..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and support PDF file"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far i had good experience with this app the only problem for me is the lack of allowing my data to be stored in an external storage."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very productive and nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice and superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exellent app, i recommend only to link it with an account so you can see same notes in all of your devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yo folks, listen up! They say, the only guy who were running this app built a company, and they are now upgrading this evergreen Application! What a news! I support you and Thank you CEO for doing a great job and decision. Love you all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best I've used for importing PDFs which you want to annotate. Fully utilizes the Google Stylus variable pressure/line thickness function. I often use Squid to make PDF presentations, and my slide advancer (Kensington with USB) does not advance ""slides."" I have to press the page advance <> icons manually. Would really appreciate the ability to fully-present without having to go to the screen to go to the next slide."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I do like this editor. I think it has good potential. To be quite honest, the design and look of the app feels kinda old and really clunky. I feel like the app just looks kinda blah. But in top of that there's a lot of functionality, just in wrong places. You provide extremely niche templates and ruling. But you only provide one pen and highlighter! Very frustrating, add in some sort of calligraphy pen or something flourishy. Something to get people creative."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great writing app. Would love to see some support for UML but love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only extra thing I want for this app is google drive sync :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use my tablet for note taking, no need to purchase a boogie board!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can I show my notes at the home screen?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just one word.... excellent. I am taking all my online classes using this app and it's working wonders for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, If Develop can upload file on cloud.I think for the Best. Thank you!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm just curious, but does the premium yearly subscription automatically renew?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not working only showing to buy premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The one thing I would like to see improvement in is the shape tool. The circle tool makes the circle in a box, and doesn't track right. If it was a select the center, drag to edge thing, it'd be more accurate. Also, the snap to a shape feature on Notability is super nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great, functional, handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Went paperless! Downloaded a few apps with good reviews but this one won out after a few weeks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such a great app for taking college notes, it allows me to add pictures and then write a note on the side and it allows me to add whatever pdf I want on it which is cool, I also can section all my classes out so I know which notes go to what. I love it and I cant live without this app. I never have to carry a big binder again uhhh makes my back hurt thank you for ,asking such a great app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app Pdf import + Edit + Export + add image + add page. And many things good for online notes. I have tried a lot alternative apps but this one has done a awesome job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great Apps!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is pretty nice. Somehow, scrolling seem a bit laggy and also lack some feature like copy picture from another app and paste directly into the page. I hope the development continue develop this app so that android tablet have the potential compete with ipad in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I NEED AN APP THAT WONT CHARGE ME MONE MY FOR A BASIC USE IM NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT IM STRESSED"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best note taking app I've used so far, over both android and apple! Some features on my wishlist for this app though are for further integration with education apps like google classroom, and of course mass import and export of pdf please!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Works great with my stylus and has been great at keeping my life organized. Thank you!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tablet user her and works just fine!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't write smoothly. Can't scribble on PDF document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is very reliable program and I use it a lot for my hall lecture . The software is stable and runs very fluid on my samsung 2016 tab A. Keep up the good work guys. I have used it since 2014."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice and easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's just another note app. I would have given it a higher rating if there was an option for a one time purchase, but it's subscription based. There needs to be folder within folder option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a good app. The writing is smooth and fluid using my Stylus on Chromebook Pro. The best part is the ability to import PDF and annotate it. Have been using this for a few years now and very happy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything I wanted in a note taking app! very smooth and fast."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Writing is very choppy and inaccurate on my device and you have to pay for most of the features. If you're going to put ""PDF markups"" in the title for a free app, why make people pay for it. I just wanted a free app that I can do my schoolwork on. It's not free at all, Infact I can probably get a paid note taking app for a better price than this. I don't recommend this app for people who want free note taking for their work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can include palm rejection"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app. Missing search buttion to find notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful app, but the lack of some specific features makes it not completed yet. Anyway, in my opinion, it's one of the best app to make notes using the stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its been very useful as a college student. the only issue i had with so far is some pdfs I download come in different orientation because it was scanned side ways. Not being able to rotate a page or doc really sucks. I went around this by locking my laptop orientation while in tablet mode. A built in doc rotation would be really useful instead of having to crop something then rotating it because i want the whole thing rotated. PLEASE ADD A DARK MODE PLEASE."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Overall a good app but whenever I try handwriting the letters turn out very boxy and there is no control over it. It's very important to me to smoothly write with my pen as I want to make notes for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's so far the best note taking app I have come across. Only features it misses out is the ability to quickly insert mathematical objects (I would love to have this as a feature. eg empty matrices, greek symbols, Integral signs) and the ability to screen record with mic audio. It would then be the perfect whiteboard app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Use with Dropbox everyday. Love handwritten notes on Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple but powerful tool for making all the meeting notes and plans forward. Paid version is definitely worth of money. Stylus response is also very good. Recommend everyone who keeps daily notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I run multplie D&D games and Squid has helped me manage my notes and use less paper. I was going through pads of post-its and note books like crazy. Now I can still feel like I am writing while saving on paper goods."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice it doesn't get stuck"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app However it may be includ presentation pointer for teaching on virtual board"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good app for writing on a tablet. Full version is 10€/year. I would give 5 stars if you could directly edit pdfs. Here you have to import the pdf edit and then export what is not so super handy in my opinion so i use other programs for pdf editing. For writing and creating new documents is the best that I know."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worst ❌❌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So useful! I use it for school and work. I highly recommend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best one so far !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good but not perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to pay 🤦‍♂️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for math distance learning. I can emulate my document camera function , record my lesson using Screencastify, and export a PDF of my notes so my students can access them. Perfect for my needs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please add dark theme for hand writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for documentation, thanks for developers.Very useful writing app for ZOOM MEETINGS with screen share. A must have for ZOOM users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"If the designers could incorporate more writing implements i.e. calligraphy pens (these are superb in Samsung Notes) then I would give this 5 stars. So it's good, but could be brilliant."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for taking notes, but UI needs upgrading for a better experience using the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best app on the Play Store for stylus driven note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good so far...still trying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You really making me pay to add text to a work...no thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for note taking and marking up PDFs. Wish there was more seamless integration with Google Drive and an option to create custom templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app for taking notes. Well worth paying the subscription to import and annotate PDFs. I only wish I could search note titles, now that I'm using it more and have lots of notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would get a 5 star if I could be able to write off the side of a PDF file..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"good but not great, It is lacking syncing across devices and I have had to reinstall it a couple time and lost all the past files I had created. The ability to use my S-Pen to write is very nice and it is very intuitive to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Impossível escrever nas bordas das páginas sem que as letras fiquem trêmulas. A única forma de conseguir escrever de forma ""limpa"" seria dando um zoom. Um absurdo... Este aplicativo é pago! Tenho Samsung Note gratuito e optei em pagar pelo Squid. Caso não acertem o problema, certamente irei considerar em voltar para o Samsung Note. No geral, o aplicativo é bom. Peca pela falta de pareamento em nuvem. Tenho que usar o Dropbox para fazer isso."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have app for college students. Works great with S pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but it would be easier to use if there was an online manual, taking clips does not seem to work for me so I have to use a snipping tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love to draw so I downloaded this app and I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So easy to use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great but it has a few cons. I'd like to see some updates and more features considering the fact you pay a montly fee for the premium version. I'd recommend adding more text editting tools (e.g. bold, underline text) and an option for organising notebooks in different subcategories."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid has been a remarkable app to use, especially for college. The palm rejection is awesome and it is useful to be able to take notes without having to have tons of notebooks. My only concern is Squid occasionally crashes. This can be annoying especially during a class. Other than that, it is an awesome app and I would recommend it to others!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very bad app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent features, we can scroll the page which is very much useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app would be better on a tablet in my opinion... Even though I have a giant phone, the zoom in while writing feature was getting on my last nerve... I'll download it on my tablet and try that out next... But I don't recommend it for your phone..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I recommend inputting a formatting capability for typing a text. Like add some features like bold, italic, and underline. Also maybe you could also add a hyperlink feature too. You could also think about having adding a cover book feature. But overall, the user experience is great. If u would just maybe add couple more features like in Goodnotes and notability this app would be also great for digital travel journaling. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is smooth and worth it, yet I wonder if it's possible to further group the different categories or not. Say for example, I want to group the different files of one subject under one category, then I'd like to further group this as for 1st semester for example."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Looks like a great app to start. The feature that it is missing most is palm rejection. Completely unusable without it. Surely this module could be bought in from someone!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi... Please add option to Bold the text... It helps a lot while making notes..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love being able to use natural writing OR converting to text- perfect note app for stylus use! flexible, powerful and intuitive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Honestly I really like it, it is better than a lot of the options out there. The only two problems I have with it is that I have to zoom in to max to write with the stylus I have (adonit snap) other wise it there are gaps. Also the fact that importing PDF isn't free bummer but it's okay. But writing experience on a PNG is kind of really sad. Over all just writing notes I really like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for annotating pdf files."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd give it five stars if it had the option of rotating things like text and selected marks. It's a important feature that stops me from loving this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what I need. I use it to take client notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my favourite note taking app on Android but there are a few features that could be added. The main feature that is lacking is cloud sync across devices. I used Squid on both a Tab S6 tablet and a Note 10 plus, but the notes don't sync, which makes this app useless to me. Another gripe I have with the app, is the lack of features to swipe between pages (you have to push the button in control panel). Why not add swipe, or volume control to change pages?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Extremely handy now that I have to teach remotely. I am using it on a Pixel Slate tablet and it is very convenient that I can write notes and edit PDF files. I would have given it 5 stars but the integration with Dropbox is a bit clunky. I cannot share my notes in the Dropox and Drive folders I share with my students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very simple and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"After using for a while, I have few suggestions/requests. Being able to save preset pen sizes and colours would be fantastic. An option to set default conditions for read-only like ""fit width"" or double tap to fit width, would be very useful when going back over notes and switching between writing and reading notes in different view ""modes"". Finally, in read-only, being able to tap RHS of screen to go to next page and LHS to go back would be gr8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is not easy to flip page in viewing mode when using a large screen device, it's better to have more ways to view a pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app. I use it all the time! While one can never get everything we want, I do wish it had the ability to search for text in documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great apps with all spec i need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I've used it around a year for school. I'd have no problem recommending the subscription version of this app. The extra features are well worth the cost, in my opinion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is the best note app that I have found for handwriting on a Chromebook tablet. The palm rejection is way ahead of other apps, even Google's own Google Keep, which is shocking to me. What would really help it to pull ahead is a dark theme and a redesigned interface that makes quicker access to all the tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app....simply works"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Veryyy bad app dont download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am using since 2018. Good app. among similler. apps for me very usefull this pdf make-up option. if you can. improve the app adding tool bar with several pens ,eraser, highlighterer, Geometrical shapes recognizing tooI, Paper type same like school notebook paper with left side line and task list paper to select using one touch I have discuss with several engineers who using this app. all were suggested same. if you can improv above you can be the best among the similler apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add infinite dragging left and up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for s pen or any Stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The tools are simplistic in design and function. Highlighting for example, doesn't allow added notes to the highlight or any bennifit beyond visiual. Functionality doesnt' exist below the surface -- like it does with every other pdf editing or markup tool I've ever used. The name Squid, suggests connections between multiple papers, and connected references. Neither of which exist. No acedemic functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I don't give a 5 star because I think it should have a way to sync to drive because sometimes I need to see some notes when I don't have the tablet with me. But other than that I don't see any issue :) it's a great app for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great but needs more features! There are lots of people begging for new and useful features since Papyrus (old name) and nothing has been added. It's been 6 years since the sync function was suggested, what happened to the team? There are lots of skilled but cheap programmers nowadays. Please update the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. Works great and makes me glad I got the pen. works great for notes and for letting my kids draw."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I bought this application when it was called Papirus. After it switched to Squid I still had Premium features. Now that I reinstalled it in my device, and I don't have any Premium feature and the app require me to buy Premium again. How can I get my Premium features back?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for taking notes of everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Will there be two important functions like I have used frequently on GoodNotes 5 on my iPad Pro which are ""Automatic straight lines for the highlighters"" and ""Multiple fonts selection""? Because these two functions make GoodNotes 5 still be the best PDF annotating app ever. Furthermore, the highlighter should make words and sentences look clearer, not fade. Thus, the highlighter should not overlay on the texts. Is this a glitch? Or just something the developers haven't realise it. Regards."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nearly perfect. Just great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for casting and teaching"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"would like to s have some features such as, change fort style convent written to actual text to-do list"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Snappy and feature full! My only issue with this app is the lack of cloud syncing. Backing up and restoring from cloud services does work, however it is much more complicated than some thing like one-note. This makes using Squid on multiple devices a hassle. Squid makes up for this by being the smoothest, most responsive note-taker I've used on any device! One-note for android is glitchy and all the others are slow or feature-poor. PDFs are a Breeze to write over too, great for homework!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Presentation mode is mentioned everywhere in the help but not how to actually turn it on or use it. I have looked everywhere and I cannot find anything other than settings for it, which are just for enabling and automatically starting. I have no idea how to actually use it. Here is not a link."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"There is an ink problem with using the Pixelbook Pen with i7 250 gb Pixel Slate. I tried using low-latency link but that introduces a horrible lag. While writing with the pen, sometimes the it just stops writing and then the writting that I did 5 seconds ago appears. If not it just leaves a dotted mark sometime rather than writing what I want it to write. A fix would be helpful given that I'm paid for the premium features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid for teaching high school math when I am absent from school. I load up a lesson PDF into Squid, write on my screen with my Note 10+ phone, and record my voice and writing with Screen Recorder Edge. It works very well and is easy to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like it lol"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall the Squid app meets my requirements. It would be great if I could duplicate notes and move them to other folders. I'm hoping the developers will be able to add these features in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"What Squid does it does really well. There are a few badly-needed tweaks which can make this program really great. One thing I miss is having a few pen presets rather having to adjust with sliders. The developer seems to be actively welcoming suggestions so I'm keeping fingers crossed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love squid more than love amazing know awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of my favourite apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Writting with a styllus and erasing with fingrrs is the most convenient way to take notes. Also exporting to pdf is fast and easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice application for field or site works"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Romantic Christmas present in the UK and UK and have been working on the last few years and have been working on the website for the past few years with the company and I have been looking for a new business with the most challenging and rewarding career"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Requires pro to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"ideali for my work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favourite note taking app. Works great with Samsung note stylus. Finger erase is really convenient, as you don't have to switch between pen and eraser. Wish it was available in windows"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's good but I wish you could swipe page from anywhere on the screen not just a button"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time, very handful. I think there is room for improvement in the pencil types, and adding more shapes like arrows.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, great interface, which could become even more improved, and revamped.Furthermore, it could also integrate new feautures that other similar apps have on IOS platform, like paperlike etc. All in all, this app helps you get everything done, easy peasy, so feel free to give it a shot and install it, to find out for yourself. fyi;Try purchasing the premium version, it unlocks the full potential of the app, and allows you to transfer, convert, change and transform and customize PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app, But some characters turn garbled after exporting the PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gooood"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An all-around great annotation program. I use this program to take preparatory and mid-hearing notes when I'm in court, and to annotate PDFs when I review documents. I used to use Inkredible (from memory), but Squid works infinitely more smoothly with my HP Chromebook X2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi everyone, I tried several comparable apps for handwriting. I really suffered from a lag between touching the screen and an actual response, it made handwriting almost impossible. But in Squid such a lag is not noticeable, I just set a scale to 1000% and used my laptop as a paper notepad, loosing only a small amount of speed (but I guess it's due to my laptop and a pen itself, but not the software) I really like this app and appreciate your work, thank you guys P. S. I miss a calender option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far so good. If can improve gesture on changing page will be great And have better cloud system. Automatic not manually"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Wish PDFs imported as one continuous document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic. You deserve a 5 star rating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app is ok but most basic stuff like to do lists are premium only. This is really annoying and all the music staves are premium even the basic ones. Can't do much without paying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app, looks great, gets the job done. Subscribed to be able to make notes on my pdf files. Wish there were more types of pens and a convert to text option though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even import a PDF without paying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I need to use this app on my laptop by using google chrome but I can't find any video related to that. so it means that I am using it on my android phone only."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Liked it and upgraded to ""Pro"" as I needed to annotate some PDF files but then didn't use it for a few months. Can't use it now that I need it for more PDF work because it insists I ""Upgrade to Pro"" again. Nope. Six-fifty every few months is too expensive. Not gonna happen. There are other PDF tools that once bought, stay bought. Uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I loved this app. Seriously considered switching to this exclusively, however, there are some drawbacks. One, there isn't an option to sync to onedrive or googledrive. Huge issue for me, considering I really wanted a way to store all my notes in college. Two, I hate the organization of this app. I can't make folders or subfolders or color coding. Three, I hate the fact that I can't type notes as well. Sometimes I want to handwrite but other times I don't. I hope they update soon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"SUCH a useful app. I can import pdfs to write on directly, and use the Cornell-style notes to rewrite an interpret. I use the grid paper for drawing and the dots for tracking journals... it's SO helpful and has reduced my need to carry paper notebooks. It would be extra helpful if I could attach voice recordings to the stored notes somehow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use PDF annotations for my work, it's really really helpful and straight forward. I wish it also has a desktop app that works together with the mobile app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for taking notes on my Tab S4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best for handwriting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good for my Chromebook, but will there ever be better options for pen styles?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Why cant the notes be re arranged"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please allow us to create a note template based on an imported pdf. Also copying and pasting an entire note would be very beneficial."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yes, this is best! I used this app on my mobile phone, tablet and Chromebook. One feature I want to have is record sequence of writing, drawing. It means we can make it as video file then share to the others... The other simple add on could be dark background. All background image is white and quite difficult to my old eye. But this app is the most productive note taking app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It is a really good app but mostly everything thing is premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would not use another note app! I tried OneNote, EverNote, and others... not the same. This is leaps and bounds ahead. It is in a different format, if you have a powerpoint PDF, you have to click through vs slide down but it doesnt bother me a bit."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for my sketchnotes.! The only app that lets me assign buttons of my pen.. This app is best.. one available.. Wonderful team behind it! Thankyou sooooooo muchh.. u are helping me a lot🙌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"it has limited options like: (1). you can't copy a pdf file and insert on the note page. (2). it lacks objects e.g. shapes and fills that may as be like the available in good notes. (3) it does not have the option of hand write to text choice fonts. However, it is a good app only for note taking. You may have some difficulties if you are a good notes user. I may be bias with this but this is my opinion only. thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Too expensive for Pro Version... Uninstall & goodbye"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be perfect if I could erase highlight with the true eraser tool & had the ability to create folders within folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very usefull. I use it every time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good help, on studies"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great to use easie to use only complant is i wish i can share with notes easier and throught out many devises. other then that in the construction and electrical arean it workes great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been such a help with university work. It allows me to have all of my notes, summaries and more with me wherever I go. It's super functional with the ability to import .pdf files and insert photos. One of the best investments I've made so far in regards to my studies."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I want you to create a drag and drop option of Google Images in this app, this will help us in making NOTES easily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It is useful in creating PDFs and sharing. It is not very efficiant to work with the editing tools, adjusting size or changing pages order. But it still allowes to work on PDFs where some other apps don't."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great and easy to use so many options worth it! never had a probelm"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good handwriting editing experience on my Galaxy S Tab 3, better than the Samsung Notes app. I would like to be able to search my notes using OCR on the handwriting. Then I would give 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just wish it could sync"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good handwriting app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Paid apps for iPad are better than for Android. Really weird scroll because can't see what you are scrolling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best app for taking notes, Been using ti for my college courses. Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for stylus-enabled devices!! The free version is great for notes and meetings. With the paid version, creative expression including sports, music, and engineering templates are available. USE IT ALMOST DAILY!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"All nice thing are on premium 😭"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Im a mechanical guy and I use this app constantly to sketch up projects and ideas as soon as they come to me. Don't need anything fancier when I'm out in the field, so this is perfect!Although I don't really need the pro version am planning to get it sooner or later just to support your efforts. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great tool for taking notes and ability to print. I would like to see an option to buy all premium features for one lifetime price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very like this app.. only Need to improve the page loading if zoom in or zoom out, to make it smooth like apple apps.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would be better if having more in drawing i.e. arrow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish that PDF editing is free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, responsive, snappy, fluid ! Very suitable for natural feel of note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Expensive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish it had more colors for highlighting and different kinds of pens"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This my primary notebook. I write, draw and scribble. I also use it for all my reading of research papers etc. at work, annotating as I go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but sadly lacks many features. Even premium version is not comparable with iOS apps such as notability :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As an investigator, this app changes everything! I can take handwritten notes, add a photograph, save it all to a PDF and forward it to my client instantly. Perfect for recording statements, collecting evidence and organising thoughts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome tool to replace paper. I use it as my notebook in college and it works. I just wish it had more options pen options. And also, the writing was more precise."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of most useful tool for my android tablet. I like ik."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Requested update for --- There are various ways to write with S-pen pen,pencil,highlighter,calligraphic pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for writing app. Revolutionized my class note takng update: still the only option on Android for seamless note taking. every other app has crazy bugs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extremely handy app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's very simple nd easy to use.. I think one function is missing to scroll down nd up.. You can only change pages.. But can't move screen when file is open"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is by far one of the best apps for note taking. There are some functions that can improve your experience but it is one of the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a very reliable app especially when you buy the premium or rather subscribe with the premium. However, I would like them to improve the interface to look more attractive for users to enjoy more writing with the app. My favorite is that I can now easily write on photos or PDFs which help me sign or fill up needed documents conveniently with my tablet. I only gave 4/5 stars since I'd like to see improvements and that this is a subscription based app. But overall, I'm very happy with it :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really am enjoying the app so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works amazing! I love the variety of paper options and the PDF markup tools are perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for bringing in clipped screens and writing on them mostly crossword from telegraph and guardian apps that I dont like. This works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great, but the checkered transition when you move the page is annoying. Also it would be amazing if you could rename individual notepages within a single note. So a note with 8 pages could have each individual page be renamed. This would be an amazing organizational tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app...but it should have much more brush options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Paying just sucks, but it's worth it 💯"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be nice to be able to change the colour of the background/paper. ( for ruled paper)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes during lecture. Writing notes directly on lecture slides has helped me study more efficiently and organize my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Please improve the folder system so some notebooks can be placed into one folder, and also please provide a feature to copy many notes instantly into another notebook without exporting them one by one. Thank you so much :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All tools all of the app is good. It is very simple for making notes and content."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good and user friendly app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Phenomenal note-taking and study tool. With my Galaxy Tab S6 I don't even want to touch pen and paper anymore. I took a star because the app seems to suffer from periodic calibration malfunctions where the pen output is either slightly or significantly off from the point of contact. The only way I've found to fix it is to close and reopen the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This apps help me a lot! Tq Squid!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app actually I can't use another app for writing on PDF except Squid But I will give 5 stars rating if this app able to open PowerPoint files directly and if there is recording while I'm writing.... I hope to see that soon"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent App! I have been doing Field Engineering for Electric Utility Company's for 30 years and searched & searched for the best way to take notes. Squid is it! Even in extreme cold & heat still works!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. I don't have the special pen/tool, I just use a pen I bought over amazon to take notes at school. It would be nice if the text boxes worked a bit easier, like being able to type freely or even choosing different fonts and sizes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The upgrades are totally worth it! Nice to be able to highlight PDFs and mark them up. Even without the add-ons, the basic functions are way better than the default Google Keep that was installed with my Chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great. I use it for my degree in computer science. But I really wish there were additional tools, such as more shapes, and other styles of pens that look different. I have pretty bad handwriting, so when the pen is a simple rounded line, it just looks bad. But all in all, squid is fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Features are really useful amongst similar android apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"DELETE SQUID."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The ink lags on occasion [more likely when there's more ink on the page], but that's my only complaint. The free version alone has all the functionality I need for handwritten notes, checklists, and the like, and I use this app almost every day. The copy/paste tool is also super useful. Thank you, developers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"un-installed. over priced."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Still can't backup to Google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for marking up my lecture notes. Excellent extention to my learning process."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notetaking app I've ever used. I've tried using everything from OneNote to Neebo. They never had the simple and extremely useful feature of making your notes page-based, and the ones that did, never allowed you to make that the standard format of your notes. If I weren't so broke at the moment I would get the premium version, but oh well. Cannot stress enough how much I use this app and love it (however I don't ever write reviews for apps, so that might just show you how good this is)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for basic note-taking functionality: the ability to organize notes in folders, graph paper notes, and importing PDFs to annotate. All of the big names either couldn't do these basic things, or would charge literally hundreds of dollars. Squid offered everything I needed for a fraction of the price of Microsoft OneNote. I'm so glad I found it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the interface and current capabilities, I only wish that when you imported PDFs it imported the bookmarks and that you could type in what page you wanted instead of having to school through hundreds of pages. Overall, though: GREAT!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It won't let me edit any pdf. If you need a way to edit any pdf do not get this. Absolute waste of money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely LOVE this app and use it every day. Where has it been for the last 40 years?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be perfect if you add an option to enable vertical scrolling while writing in A4 mode (or add an only vertically infinite page)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app a lot but... when can we see the feature of syncing across devices?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for writing with a stylus although loading times when panning back and forth could be faster."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can you guys please make the paper and grid type able to be purchased Seperately like the tool and PDF Package? it'll be helpfull. thanks btw you guys are awsome :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Pen alignment glitches. You cant flag pages, type in a page to go to, or open two documents at once (in split screen) as far as im aware. Other than that its good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what it claims to do, works well for note taking and as well as rough work. It is also a nice app for keeping random thoughts. So far so good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It is a pain to pan and scroll page. No palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app its the best note taking app for chromebooks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT App I really enjoy writing on any page size I want. I've set the default size of notes to a full size page. My favorite feature is the easy erase, but the ability to move text is also great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great! But I'd love some more features. First: hiding the top bar. Especially in landscape on my phone (note 9), it gets really in the way. Second: dark mode. That's it. Really like the app, nothing to complain, and so far does its job far better than onenote, which I replaced with this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its wonderful to take notes on. I wouldn't use anything else now!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My go-to writing tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this App, and actually it is my favourite. No more losing my notes, all together in one place, besides in comparison with other applications that provide the same service, Squid is on top among these apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"does not tell you before you download that in order to even open a pdf you have to purchase an upgrade."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for reducing paper consumption in school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Installed then immediately uninstalled, need to pay to import pdf documents so what's the point i cant even try it before i buy it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app, less options at moment, but the UX is nice, if you add the grid snap function it will be more bettere than bettere"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app but lacks simple features. We need a search function for pdfs and sync option for multiple devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"For a monthly payment subscription,the app simply doesn't meet the ends . It's a great app with great features and I would've gladly bought a premium version if it were available. The app lacks a lot in terms of synchronisation ,there's no way to sync between devices,and if I don't backup my data regularly all is lost, which means I need to upload my notes which are like couple MBs together every-single-day, Certainly a deal breaker, I had preferred this over onenote. but now ,not so sure"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"What I dislike the most is occasionally the screen will suddenly sense either zoom in/out or pan and send me hurling across the page. When I have the pages in infinite I would have to zoom all the way out and find where my notes are.. I use this on the Google Slate. there should be an option to use the button on the pen for additional functions. i.e the pen writes and when I touch with my finger I can erase what I pick. I'd like to use the button for selecting function. Very good app though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app... 😍😍 no more heaps of books and lost or coffee stained notes. I am a veterinary science student and all I need for my studies I have in one place; notes, slides and lecture content, I even have huge collections of pictures with the descriptions right next to it... couldn't ask for anything more... thx squid 💜💜"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"At least you have to unblock the text tool. Not useful, if you don't have digital pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"While I would love a well made app to support note taking, commenting on PDF's and other functionality, I'm not into being charged a recurring fee. I'll pay to buy the app but I'm not interested in having a subscription. Though replies to other reviews indicate premium features can be purchased, not subscribed to, the app doesn't appear to support this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Note pages that load quickly, pressure sensitivity, and the ability to rearrange passages of hand-written text (and drawings!): Revolutionary. Now a good backup method makes this app a complete dream; THE reason to have a Galaxy Note and throw away pocket notebooks forever. Great tech support as well, and backwards compatibility."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. I have used for a couple years. I wish it was a one time fee vs a monthly then I'd buy the papers. Very usable app for phones with pens and tablets with styluses as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Super helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, even for non-premium use. Super useful, I use it for my class notes and I never have to carry multiple books!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great little app for marking up pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a great app; particularly useful for tablet devices like my Chromebook Plus. I love being able to write on pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"THE CHECKERBOARDING. WHYYYYYYYYY"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful for doing homework that I need to upload as a pdf or want to print. My main complaint is the pressure sensitivity is unusable for me on my Samsung Tab S3 - it takes far too much pressure for me to produce a stroke with the SPen that is not too thin. I think it would help to have a nonzero minimum brush size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be brilliant to get a protractor and ruler built in as tools for drawing more precise diagrams as well as have more backup options than the now redundant Dropbox"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Fix 2 things, and you would crush your compatition: 1) have an easy access (and customizable) toolbar 2) split screen view, so we can write on the pdf and notes at the same time.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not as good as the old S-Note app. Image can be enlarge beyond the page size. Touching image with the finger erases lines, not good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb app from Steadfast."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Uninstalled as soon as Installed. Free note taking is only in ""draw"" mode. Text input is a premium feature. This makes no sense at all. No point of paying for a feature that is free in other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"pretty good app to use, but I wish I could use a color option like highlighter or colored font."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid People - My only request!! Your app would be 5-stars if you had an option to see more tools on the top (visible) tool bar. I hate having to drop down one layer to switch from pen to highlighter, or to draw a line or a box. (So many operations become two clicks instead of one.) There aren't that many tools (which I LOVE, btw: simplicity!) ... So why not have a *toggle option* allowing you to see all tools on one line? It would speed up my work SO much. Thanks, folks, love this product. :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Definitely recommend it I just wish if I can scroll pages like the usual way (not only from the arrow) also adding some important features like recording voices and the night mode, but overall the premium version gave me the best PDF editor app for android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"برنامج جيد"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There are very important features missing like cloud sync with Google drive. It is also missing auto-sync so that you can access all files throughout all devices. This app definitely has the potential to be great but the missing features is really sucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish it had better syncing but writing is smooth"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best notetaking app on mobile no doubt"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app, but unlocking things one by one as in app purchases doesn't allow for family sharing while using Chromebook tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best notes app EVER"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the app I use to take all of my notes for school. It's easy to use and has plenty of functions for whatever I need to write. I love using it to take handwritten notes without having to carry around 2 or 3 notebooks every day. Would definitely recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for handwriting on a Samsung tablet with pen. Still missing a few features to make it easier to use, like better tool and color switching. But at least it supports any color and has a good preselection of colors."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for note taking, especially for attending lessons. My one problem with the app is the 'rendering' interval when you are using the infinite paper mode. If that could be adressed, at least for the reading/viewing mode, the app would simply become perfect. Other than that I strongly recommend it to anyone with a tablet, pen responsivity, editability, variety..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome consistent app wish it wasnt pay monthly for premium, maybe something one time cost? . But standard serves it purposes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great, can do with a better saving system. Easier, to locate and call up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I will send you my review"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quite good but I wish everything was free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Cant markup pdf without paying $5. Stupid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good - potential to be amazing. I have samsung phone and a samsung tablet. I did not realize this app would not sync with both devices. I dont use dropbox etc. I also paid for the premium version and I feel it is basic assumption that the notes within the app should be able to sync across platforms. I also voted on your idea page. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is the first note taking app ive used so i dont really have anything to compare it to but so far im enjoying it. One thing i would like to have is an easy way to switch between my favorite pen point settings. It's a little tedious scrolling to get to a certain point size and having that would save so much time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would say this app does what it is supposed to do. I use it for my knitting patterns and mark off steps as I progress. I can also make notes if I need to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for something to take handwritten notes on and it was a clear winner for not accidentally moving the page and I really like the one finger eraser rather than having to hit undo or change tools. I do wish the tool bar was not so compact and I could get to the capture tool, eraser, etc...with less touches. With premium the templates are useful though repetitive. Gotta love they have a hockey tempae which I do use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Complete bs & false advertising. You have to pay to edit PDFs although the description explicitly states this is an available feature. Thanks for wasting my time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really do love this app! I use a galaxy tab s4 for Uni and after lots of looking for the perfect app I found that squid has almost everything I need. Yet the reason I've rated 3 stars is for one major aspect I find is lacking; note organization. Lots f other apps lack what squid has but beyond creating new notebooks there's very little organization when it comes to tagging things, creating subsections within notebooks etc. I'd really love to see this addressed =) Also syncing between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good. Easy. Basic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can rule lines be added when there is a black/different colored background? I like taking notes on a black background but hate that I can't have rule lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app entirely replaces taking notes on paper for me. All of the features are very intuitive to access and the writing is very smooth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful for studying. The feature that lets you add pages is also really valuable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Ups: * Erase with one finger. Scroll with two. * Insert page function. * Backs up PDFs and a recovery file automatically. Downs: * Backs up only to Dropbox and some other cloud service no one has ever heard about. * text selection is always square so usually selects some text you didn't mean to. * No folders. Only notebooks. * Multiple page selection works only for erase function. All other multi page functions you can think of must be done manually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for writing notes and able to move words anywhere you want. Wish there was more pen options like marker or pencil. Another issue is its lack of settings options, for example, i would prefer if the start up page can be chosen as a specific notebook instead of a general recent notes page. Have not tried the writing on PDF tool as it is only available in premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"A thousand times worse than xodo, on pixel slate, worse pen support, and even more sluggish, cannot get things done. I even purchased the premium, waste of money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A little more lag than Samsung's own notepad, but the well organised categorisation makes up for it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"it keeps force closing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish there was a voice recording function and being able to make folders. Other than that, everything is fine. I don't know if it's my tablet problem(Samsung Galaxy Tab A with S Pen 2016) or it's the app's. From time to time my pen and the ink are not at the same place (I jotted my stylus down at one place, but the ink appeared at another place on screen)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like many others, I cant believe this app is free. I use it for all engineering notes & hw. My opinion, but Squid > OneNote. Edit: This app couples very well with Xodo(PDF Editor) to tackle all of my academic needs. Edit 2: Forgot this, but ome of the main advantages for me was the ability to back up files to a drive with no hassle (not forced to use a designated cloud)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for class notes and free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Funciona bien, mee gustaría que se pudieran mover mas páginas a la vez, así como que hubiera una herramienta de gráficos. De ahí en fuera todo perfecto!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Saved my life tbh. Saved money printing out my notes. Plus now I'm way more organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Mehr als ich gedacht hätte."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'll glady pay either the $1 or $10 for use of this app, however, I will not pay by the month nor year. I expected ""premium"" features to be held behind a pay wall, but this is greed and I do not respect this business model at all. EDIT: The features you're talking about are in the ""tool pack"" I'm assuming. I'm looking for different backgrounds without the subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome note taking app, but some features are lacking. It would be nice if one can delete part of the line and not the whole or some nicer gestures. The panel could also be rewamped, by making the selection of tools not so painful (multiple steps to select and configure)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's awesome! I would, however, appreciate the ability to make folders and organize my notes, otherwise I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give 5 stars, but I wish there was a way to create folders for your notes. I'm a college student and it would be awesome to divide up my notes by class and separate out my non-school notes. Also the infitine line width and length is tough to navigate when you're trying to write well-organized and straight notes. and don't like the cornell format. But overall this is the best notetaking app I've used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used it for note-taking at school. I am very satisfied and I am excited to see the future delevelopmets of this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is an amazing app! It is very user friendly, and I use it almost daily to take notes for school. Easy to use without being overly crowded with tools you will never need. Would highly recommend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy!!! I use this to Mark up my presentations on my classes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally got perfect one💖"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Just wish there was an upgrade without a subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does almost exactly what I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has been excellent for note taking in my courses. Being able to import PDFs is a huge plus, but it does require the pro version. I bought the pro version after my first time using it. I do wish it was possible to view all of the pages in a document in a grid view so I could quickly switch back and forth. I also have some issues with palm rejection on the Pixel Slate, but I think it is an issue directly with the slate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All I wanted was to free draw on graph paper. Exactly what I was looking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!! i do alot of work with grocery store blue prints and its really cool to be able to open it in Squid and mark it up with notes while im walking the store with my tablet. 5 stars isnt enough."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It is seriously lacking dark mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient, great UI"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Pros: Can organize files into different folders/sections Can upload and mark up PDFs Decent interface Cons: No extra space to make notes on PDF Not great responsiveness when hand writing notes No option to upload documents to a cloud to be accessed on different devices Conclusion: It's just okay. If you can get OneNote it is far superior."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app... helped me a lot ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good app for making lists and annotating notes and pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Magnifique"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like most of its functions.But i kinda feel annoyed by its layout.I want to use full view too Coz I like to take notes on pdf and also want to read in one app.If possible add a better (Clear and simple with attractive colour)layout with full view in update plz.Now i'm using inkeditable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Moving text is a bit difficult (for small movements) as there are two texts close to each other. Only 1 text should be there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to journal, however I wish it would sync with among devices. Would also like to see a password protect on it though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Why is there no way to input using a keyboard? This is really too bad since the app is otherwise very good to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A real tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for writing on PDFs and saving / sending. All I needed it for, works like a charm. Recently the true eraser tool got really large, so is less useful now - haven't figured out how to fix it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Recently transferred to an android tablet for work after years with an iPad. Use it to write on PDFs. Okish app for the price and overall it does the job. In terms of UX/UI far behind the iPad OS competition (Notability, GoodNotes). Sure, it's simple but it looks like something from 2010... Wished there was a way to add audio notes and more importantly work with typed comments. Sometimes it's nice to write longer comments into a PDF rather than handwritten remarks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy and nice to use with my stylus pen, i love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app . Very easy to take notes while studying or reading"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the way it saves a copy of every pdf you open for easy access next time!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would rate it 5 stars because it's actually a great app, but due to the lack of a ""search function"" when working with PDFs, this is actually a very basic feature that seems to be ignored for ages on the feedback side, it's in between ""ok"" and ""good"". I really consider quitting my subscribtion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what i expected it to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Everything is nice about the app except that it does not allow a range of pages or a bunch of selected pages from a single note. One can either export the entire note or a single page. This defeats my purpose where I want to share notes with my students at the end of a lecture. If this issue is addressed, then I will change the rating to 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for taking short notes and save in pdf format. Wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"very laggy, crashes allot. But writing with my stylus is very smooth when it doesn't crash sometimes split screen with this app makes my tablet cry for help"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worked well and was helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome. Took a little while to get the feel for how everything connects, but once I did, i found it super useful. I use it for both work and school and there is a ton of other features you can use, such as for drawing and sports. Really recommend it! Dan"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The writing needs to be smoother please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy. I can make meeting lists on the fly and make drawings of details free hand or with geometric drawing option to send to guys in the field via text. Essential if you have a Note or other stylus phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome, its very useful for my college and personal life"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Nice app, but way too expensive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Honestly this is an awesome app... i love it down to the creator."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like it, and I'm excited to experiment with it using my Google Pen but at the moment, when using a cheaper touch screen one, the app crashes when I'm zooming in/out to make notes. Irritating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I tried a few different apps but I keep coming back to Squid. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it still misses a few features for me. Recording lectures, infinite downward scroll with locked width, favorite pens tool. I want to be able to change between 4 different ""pens"" with different thickness and colors or even straight lines. It would be nice to have an option where you can add premade pens so you can change with just one click."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Doesn't have hand writing to text conversion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic! Now if it would only convert hand writing to typed text....😁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the best note taking....app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. The ability to save sketches as pdf file is very useful for later reference."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Practical and versatile, love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time. Best note keeper ever!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but not available for ios devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app that has revolutionized my notetaking. The variety of templates and ability to import pdfs for writing notes is great. I used to have a hard time locating specific notes I had taken. Now all my notes are organized in one app. I do hope they'll add the ability to move pages between notes, but even without, it's worthy of 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Please add arrows and and the option to angle text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An excellent and very useful app. Only gave it 4 star due to sync issues and non availability of handwriting to text converter feature. But overall its good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall okay. I wish the app gave more pens, pencils, and symbols to decorate my notes with. It sometimes shuts down when I'm in the middle of writing, but other than that no real bugs or issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its awesome feels just like using paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice note-taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bought subscription. But scroll to or jump to particular page isn't working. Fix this. I need to navigate through files as large as 4000 pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Options of folders will help"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Perhaps the best note taking app for handwritten notes on Android, it has a few major flaws. The apps runs very smoothly, however the lack of handwriting recognition (seen in the iOS apps Notability and Goodnotes 5), poor folder organisation, lack of search, terrible cloud syncing, and expensive price really cripple what is a decent app. I genuinely don't think that the updates offered to this app are regular, and feature rich enough, to justify a yearly subscription model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best note tacking app i`ve used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app has a lot of potential but seems that a lot of requests are sitting on their desk with only limited additional features being added. it's good for what it is but has so much room to grow."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best writting app ever. Great integration with Evernote and others makes it such a great work tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app for tablet and phones with pen mode. Galaxy tab s4 user. Very good with split screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Almost good. Just needs pan with stylus button press only feature to stop the scrolling around. So painful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very happy with this app! All of the templates are awesome! The music sheet template is my most used one! Really helps get speedy notation written out very smooth and easy without much effort needed! Feels just like writing on regular paper! Thank you for making this app! Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still need a lot of improvement like adding different types of writing instrument, setting to change color or theme, to easily reselect picts, better selecting tools, and so on"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall, I do quite enjoy using this app. It has a lot of nice features (provided you upgrade to premium), but I would want a more sophosticated file system, such as a better folder system and the ability to view my notes in list view (and not just grid view). For notes without infinite page scroll, I would also like the ability to go to the next page by scrolling and not having to keep pressing the 'next page' button"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like this app for hand writing notes. I like how the pen feature looks. Makes my writing easy to read & not look messy. I also like how there's many page options & different setting options. Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Closest Thing to noteability and works great with S pen. I Use it for school and its very easy and efficient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Angry customer here. Why do we need to tap the pen symbol to find the rubber, and then type the rubber to find the pen? Place them side by side for Christmas sake. Urgent, i need to speed up my work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Was able to markup and add photos to huge PDF plot (ARCH E size 10ft long) with ease. Navigating a huge drawing was just as fast on Squid than on a desktop viewer. Of course more features could be added but the speed and simplicity of this app is its main selling point. Used on Galaxy tab Active Pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. I use it primarily for work. Sophisticated enough to meet my needs; simple enough to be easy to use. I have used Evernote for years and love it, however the handwriting functionality lacks maturity (unless you are a Mac user and subscribe to Pentultimate). I wish Squid added functionality allowing a colored background on Android devices and perhaps made the folder structure a bit more sophisticated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"👍..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"fair experience,however on extensive uses the writing via pen lags intermittently"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Couldn't do school work without it. Also a great program for quick and simple presentations. Easy to create, organize and navigate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it frequently, with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Terrific for diagramming and doodling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall satisfied with this app. Hope this app can be improved by adding more functions to the premium subscription, like adding a bookmark page to the pdf file or able to insert a small memo in the page to make it more convenient to the readers. Sometimes is hard to remember the particular important part within a 1630 pages pdf ebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Erasing wrongly written data should have options...such as spot clearing...at present entire connected data will get erased if written in cursive.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give 5 if it had more options for background such as black grid or black college or what would be ideal is allowing custom backgrounds"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only lacking sync with cloud storage for free version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Changed my review to 5 stars, I can finally upload all 500 of my PDFs online! I've been using this for 5 years now, it works perfectly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! (Although it would be nice to have support for Google drive for cloud backup)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app of it's kind! Used this in a production environment for months and it never let me down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I really like this app and have been using it for about eighteen months. However, recently, I can no longer upload PDF's to edit--it just bugs out! So, my major reason for using the app is no longer there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Mostly great but has some quirks. ui doesn't always make sense"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had bought the premium package a long time ago and the support team helped make sure all the premium features still worked on my new galaxy note 10+. Great software and service!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Decent writing app. No palm rejection, which limits its utility. Good quality for its price (free)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"page loading is pretty bad. Unfortunately unusable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Reads the interactive pen extremely well, fast and accurate. Best note taking app I have tried."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The pages could load faster, by removing the checker board loading while navigating around the page. This checkboard loading is quite distracting and doesn't make the page navigation look smooth"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app to take notes on the Samsung Chromebook Pro, let me add that this app is one the best to take notes, I will like to sync with my google drive, but for now, it is excellent. Keep making better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great but not going to buy the the extras. It's not worth the monthly charge."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greatt app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Zero support. Zero updates. There is STILL no way to scroll PDFs...despite requests SINCE 2013!! People have lost their work due to auto-backup which doesn't happen. There is an entire forum with suggestions but none of them have been auctioned. They developers do not care. There are no replies to user feedback on Facebook. The developers have walked away from this project...but they're happy to keep taking your money. This is NOT a GoodNotes alternative. Terrible attitude by developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid app not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has basically eliminated the need of having a printer! Its simple and easy to use. I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I was really hyped on this app and what it can do. But subscription is the only option. When you refuse to give a purchase option and force subscription it off puts people. So I dont wanna use your app anymore and I hope nobody else does either 🖕"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app! Best drawing and writing app I have used. But, to type text or import a PDF you have to pay. Very disaapointing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app suits my needs. It has allowed me to go paperless. No need for a pen and paper, copying notes to forward via e-mail is a breeze. Fantastic app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not better than pics art color as many things are premium in squid and also no option for filling paint or changing font☹️☹️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Favorite"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal app. Simple and intuitive. Love being able to assign my own commands to touch input."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Big life saver for my classes. Note taking is a breeze with this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very responsive to a scribe. I enjoy the templates. Very useful as a join journal, planner, notebook. Sketching. All in one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Great app whilst using a pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for handwritten notes that I found so far. The only complaint: I would like a bigger variety of writing tools/brushes and a more tools over all (for example, I would like to be able to create a solid color shape, not just the outline)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great, I paid for the full version and use it for grading students' reports submitted in Acrobat format. Exporting the graded document as another .pdf provides me with a complete document with my handwritten comments to return to the student. It's also excellent as a note-taking app in meetings using my Google Pixelbook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Bom em tomar notas. Péssimo em conectividade."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best experience ever!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Been using for a month now and its super clean, w/ lots of good tools. The premium tools seem super helpful and I'll probably buy them, but I can do most of what I want for free. Only thing I wish is there was a fullscreen mode (maybe I just can't find it?). I'm on a note9 and space is a premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"found the app very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for doing homework for math/Chem/Engineering classes. I have all my assignments that I've done on this app saved making it extremely easy to go back and reference"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does everything wondeful. I love being able to do notes with my class and then seemlessly post those notes to Google Classroom for my students to view."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing App! super easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it. I use it daily for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesomely useful on my note9 since it has stylus support. Most used and useful app fir me. Ability to export as pdf is great and extremely useful. It's hard to find a fault with it :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My note 9 suddently became my notepad too. Dev if youre reading this i love you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Currently using the premium version on android. Hands down the best stylus note taking app on android. However, there's a few features I would love to see. This includes providing additional shapes and 2d and 3d graph axis as a shape and maybe text to shape feature like one note. Providing more preset styles would be a nice addition. It would also be much better if there is an alternative to add to google drive. I feel like the file managing system should have an option to set as a list."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good (but not as good as S Note). Works well. Scrolling and zooming not very easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thisis good for drawing or for school things"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works really well, love the option to import pdf's. Wish you Could nest folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, easy to use, very handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I'm using this app via my Google Pixel Slate and it's perfect fit to its design. Especially with Pixel Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app for me.. Although I may suggest that you include page scrolling option (like the continuous page scrolling for it will be very helpful in studying pdf format materials."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Found big bug when using the shape generator. When using the oval and making it very thin as if it was a line, makes the entire window/screen flicker by covering it with the color of the shape. Otherwise, great app. I hope the developers fix this soon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid to write up and send contracts for my small business. It's perfect. I have zero complaints. Before this I was using Adobe Fill and Sign. That is, I was trying to use it. It was so glitchy I kept losing my documents and having to start over completely. I haven't had a single problem with Squid. And it does so much more than the Adobe app. Wish I'd found Squid sooner."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"would easily be a 5 star with Google Drive support as automated backup option (or even automatic local backup tbh)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"pretty cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a good useful app, well done! But why would I pay when one note is free?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect. Continuous scrolling PDF view would be really nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app as a college student for about two months and cannot recommend it enough. As a matter of fact, there is very little likelihood that I will ever go back to writing in notebooks for class. I like it that much. My only issue is it doesn't have the functionality I would like when it comes to organizing and reviewing my notes. A sub-folder option would be a nice feature, as well as being able to have multiple tabs open to switch back and forth. Really good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great vector image editor with a focus on pen input. Works great with the Galaxy Note series."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works better than other notebook app and it works well with my stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best handwriting android software that i use. Only if you can add a function that pin the notes to home screen like a sticky note or a widget will be essential for this beautiful app.thank you for the hard work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good app, could be much better if you add the ability to crop from a certain pdf and paste it onto another page in that notebook. plus, please add a line stabilizer. and, can you add it so it would be able to sync with a pc? or at least downloadable to pc? tnx"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Low-latency ink is really nice but often cuts out, so I have to disable it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice to use but will be nicer if have more fonts for typing and more pen types for writing. Overall is okayy :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I'm actually a bit disappointed with the subscription scheme to unlock the basic features other apps could provide for free... Otherwise Squid is really a powerful tool to create notes and annotate PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Unfortunately still now it take a lot of screen size just for unnecessary menus! Otherwise good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am using a Galaxy Tab S6 and athough pen's responsiveness is better in Samsung Notes, Squid has better pressure sensitivity, more page options including ability to choose a finite page size, much better hand-written text geometry and much better notes export options when compared to Samsung Notes. Overall, Squid is a much more polished experience. All that Squid's developers' need to do is get the S-pen latency to Samsung Notes level and the app will then be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Well-crafted application with a intuitive interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So helpful!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would love some more pen options, layers support, sync into 3rd party apps (evernote?). Otherwise a great app, considering buying premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would be great if it had the option to go full screen and hide the blue bars on the top and bottom -- it takes up a lot of screen space on my phone..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing !!! So much better the one note mobile app. Very comfortable, usable, user friendly!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and my favorite feature is that you can tell the app what size and type of paper you want to ""write"" on, and then you can print out perfectly on the size of paper you selected without any size issues. Got the upgraded version so I could write on PDF's. Would recommend this app to anyone!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing and very useful app. I Like this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good experience. Writing is easy and fun to use through the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"'love this App."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking and thought recording"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great except I cannot copy worksheet. I need to create notebook and worksheet in the same pattern but cannot copy the original. that's really time-consuming to create everything again and again. Another trouble is sub-folder. It would be really outstanding app if all these features added. Please _/\_"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful PDF writer and reader on Lenovo yogaBook. Appears bug -free. No surprises. Modest fees."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome, the best!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"it does not give access to import pdf , left with just a notepad , there are a lot of much better notepads if i just needed a note pad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for taking notes, however the Gdrive autosync/restore that isn't available is a deal breaker"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App can inserts maps, drawings and even shoot photos into a note and make comments. Just what l need !!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesomeeeeeee for taking notes during lecture"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A magnificent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works great with a stylus and has a simplistic and easy to use interface for switching between the important tools like pen/eraser/select. The cloud saving could be improved though, since it currently only has Backups to Dropbox or Box in 6 hour intervals at a minimum."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I discovered this apps some months ago and now I can't live without it. I use it to take notes, draw notes on different tipe of pages and mainly to edit my pdf. For my studies I happen to have a lot of pdf to study on and with this app on m tablet I can write on them, use a marker, highliter and if I want to see the page clean I just erase them aftr studying. I really think according to your study method that this app can turn out very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Wanted to try it, but you need to pay $4.99 for the basic PDF Import. It should be listed in Google Play as a pay app and not as if it's free. Not going to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can you set up using finger for scroll page ? In my opinion , using finger for change page that is easy for lecture"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app, could do with arrows in the tool pack and may be a magnified import pictures, and take pictures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I hope they bring in a sync Feature and ability to use google drive as a backup soon. would also be useful to paste youtube .videos in as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"please add dark mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Total fraud@! They actually tried to charge me for opening a PDf file to *read*"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great interface for math tutoring and coaching! Only flaw is I coach volleyball and that is not a built-in layout under premium... Please update with more sports, please!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing. I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Really good and loving this app ,even subscribed to it on my office device , but..... The lack of support is just underwhelming, the inability to sync across devices is really a deal breaker and you say it's been your top priority since last October 2018,which is kinda disappointing. Shame that such an amazing app doesn't have some really quintessential features . I'm just looking for alternatives at this point :-("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need sync option with Google Drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is very bad app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The fact that you can zoom in and out essentially indefinitely on the mobile client makes this one of my all time favorite apps. Thanks!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am in love with this app. I could organize all my stuff in different notebooks. I only miss the copy function. I mean, it is possible copy your write, but not your PDF import. To the same notebook or to another... Another problem that I found is the sync mechanism.. it is not too good and I be afraid to lose my notes.. Still, it is the best notebook app I found on Play Store!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. The only thing that I wish Squid offers to make it to perfect app is to have OCR in the app and to have more pen options (like Inkredible) I like ball point pen with high amount of wetness."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"All it's missing are more pen options and multi-device synchronization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love all the features and options I have with squid, the only reason I write a 4 star review for this app instead of a 5 is because it is a little glitchy. It occasionally will not sense my stylis pen and will pan over to a random part of the note without me telling it to or zoom way in or will crash. It always saves my notes though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is by far the best note taking app. Little to no lag when writing with the stylus, easy to print out and save. Occasionally crashes when using it for 45 minutes or longer, but restarts quickly. I literally recommend this note taking app to everyone, you won't find anything else as easy to use or which writes so naturally."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app because of the Pixelbook Pen and so far it has stayed true to this mission. I look forward to more updates that support the Pixelpen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hey there, I want to say that the app is near wonderful and I am more than loved to use this app. Except recently when I am using it more often for revising/editing notes, where it involves a lot of panning, it's very annoying to see that there is like a check pattern everytime the app tries to load up the other portion of the page... Since I am having a higher end processor, it shouldn't behave this way and hopefully there will be a tweak soon. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Premium version. Lacks basic concepts such as borders around text boxes, when you double click a text it doesn't allow you to edit based on that action; you have to reclick the text icon. Also no ""snap"" alignments when trying to position boxes, etc.. Cannot change the style of the text. Very limited in it's capabilities. Just using a default off editor that comes with a computer presents the same capabilities, if not more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can be better if provide email account and can sync. Also please provide folder and sub folder system for better note management."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Lack of palm rejection maked writing hard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great ap for reading pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"PLEASE ADD SCROLL TO THE NEXT PAGE FEATURE INSTEAD OF USING THE UPPER BUTTON TO MOVE TO NEXT PAGE PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"honestly, it's very good app and it's so helpful and easy to write and use. and what really Like about it is that Ican Add Pictures and write on them. I highly Recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I Love to write on it with my Stylus pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Keeps getting better. I keep all my notes plus calendar in Squid. If you use a stylus, you need this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great writing app. Very easy to take notes. I use an S-pen when I use this app and it's fantastic. This app has changed the way I do homework and taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app for school but, can you please add a dark mode. It would help out battery life so much for those of us who have an oled display."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my daily driver with s-pen on Tab S4 since the time of my Note 2. But pen recognition is not exactly optimal on the Tab. The lines of letters are changing too much. Pressure oversensitivity? Wacom's Bamboo apk makes it much better...But otherwise I'm satisfied with Squid because of much better options to organise the notes and options in menu. 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is valuable app. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"UX is a bit too methodical, but all in all pretty good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's great and I use it for school to write on pdfs but there are things lacking. One thing is that when you try inserting text, it just keeps going in a straight line and won't go to the next line when it hits the edge of the document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app to jot down quick notes, plan out paper ideas, and make reading annotations. Been using it for 3+ years now, and will continue to use this great product!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing! I've researched so many apps and by far this is the best. It works very well with the S Pen and you can preset the button to complete different actions. If you need an app to reliably take handwritten notes, Squid is the way to go!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to plan my day and track my work. Very handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for the Galaxy Note 10.1, 2014 edition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app for taking Notes and making Notes on pdfs. Would benefit from a feature of importing PowerPoints directly rather than saving them as pdfs first, but can't really fault the app at all"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why is this app not optimised for my s pen?? Samsung galaxy Tab s6 is the only premium android tablet available.... why r you guys not supporting my s pen? Spen button not working as eraser and also false finger touches recognition while writing with s pen... btw my spen is working great in other apps and throughout UI"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, it would be perfect if it had cloud storage or the ability to save and transfer notes between devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"BETTER AND CHEAPER THAN ADOBE! I WOULD BUY A FOREVER PRICE! WORTH THE 10 DOLLARS TO UPGRADE!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved using this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Experience so far (payed version) - Perfect to annotate pdf with images and make short notes using a stylus. BUT experimentation needed with scale of pen and paper to make it work. - Easily made phtos of a live tutorial and typed the needed text. It was easy to adjust later. Needs improvement: - Synchronisation between devices - Infinite on top for standard and grid - Image editing (color adjustment, mirroring and rotation) - Insert pdf as images, especially in Cornell style - Bold and italic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Like the way you can zoom out and in on the my notes, and that's just on one page!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app so far! I use this to store all of my music for the many choruses I'm in. I have them all in separate folders, and I can mark my music as well. (I have the paid version of the app)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth the subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I enjoyed using the app initially, but over time the lack of google drive support and the intermittent syncing to Dropbox became a deal breaker. Even lost work because of that. Existing sync option further unsatisfactory because they use their own file format. One is not able to save annotations to PDFs and keep them organized in any pre-existing structure without lots of manual steps. Shame, stylus support is great but everything else unacceptable these days."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, I use it almost everyday!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm not sure if this feature exists and I haven't been able to find it or it doesn't exist, but it would be helpful to sync between devices with an account."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great editing app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but it could be more stylus-friendly. Could you add some new features like: long press + move = scroll the page, double tap + move up / double tap + move down = zoom? Rotation?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect. Should have add the feature to open multiple files at the same time. The rest works very fine."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍 amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Two years on, still using it. Nuff said."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"THE best app for class notes with s pen. And backs everything up as pdf in box! I have 5 years worth of class notes in box. Wouldnt have made it through engineering masters program without it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pay to access"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app has been feature locked for years. It's all just stability patches and compatibility updates now. The developers made the case for how a subscription model helps them put time into making this app better but there's been nothing added to make that compelling, it's all just more background skins. I bought this when it was still a one-time purchase, and tried the subscription model for a year until I saw that they weren't really going to add anything but skins then. It's still the case now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Okay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Make an option where I don't have to use a toggle menu to erase. It would be intuitive to simply have a tab like there is for the pen, but dedicated for an eraser. I really don't like having to loose fluidity of my work to toggle through a menu to get an eraser, then toggle back to continue writing. If this is added I'll purchase either tool kit or might add the annual subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well on Galaxy Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After 3 years of using it, I can say a very sound investment. Wish there was a way to open multiple notes and have a side by side vertical or horizontal viewing option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best PDF note app for chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For a first attempt (as a user) this works. UPDATE: I use this often for scratching notes at business meetings. Invaluable ! Update 10.14.19: recently bought a Samsung Tab S4. Use this app daily. Only wish it was easier to add your own PDF templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"make all features free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really enjoy using squid for the most part. It's great for taking notes, notating images, and writing on PDFs. Does all of this in a great way. It would be great if they could implement more features like searching for your written words, making it easier to scroll through your documents, and subfolders for organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly every time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app! I would give it 5 stars if the batch PDF cloud export worked with Google Drive ( it only works with Box and Dropbox). The writing experience with a stylus is great and I like that I can turn off finger gestures so that my hand doesn't accidentally do anything. I would also enjoy having multiple layers of folders, but that's not a big deal."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking though a few new shape options wouldn't go a miss"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Requires premium for everything I want to do. I guess you can probably doodle for free, but that's about all. Premium is a subscription, not a purchase. Not worth it based on all I've been able to see..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great organization of notes into notebooks. Writing is also much smoother compared to Evernote/OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like the squid app for the feel of writing with the stylus on my samsung galaxy tab s4. However, I feel that the squid notetaking app can be elevated by allowing more cloud services for backup, like OneDrive. Also there are many small features that would be useful, like being able to swipe to change pages instead of always havig to press the next button. Also things like being able to have a desktop app might also be very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great. I use squid as my main handwriting app. But there are 2 things that should be fixed. One is the lag, the lag increases when you draw a long continuos line, the longer the line the more lag it will be. Two is the palm rejection feature, when I put my palm on the screen to start writing, the paper often moved a little. It always happen if my palm touches the bezzel of the tablet. Please fix this. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app. My GO TO for note taking, filling Out contracts, and organizing work flow. Absolutly must have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good applications. only need feature to write from keyword like normal applications."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for my S4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app ever! PARADISE"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really usefull for me. I like to make notes on my books. Squid have replaced many of my heavy books."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall a decent note taking app with stylus. Palm rejection is perfect with two-finger zoom&pan. The major gripe I have is its stroke smoothing is not as good as other apps, such as Bamboo, or INKredible. So you always feel writing on a tablet is always uglier than when you write on paper with a real pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing software on the Google Pixelbook!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an application that would make it easy to write notes on pdfs - this one fits the bill. It's easy to use, very intuitive - much like writing handwritten notes directly. I'm in a medical residency and completing a PhD simultaneously, and I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition, and this app has exactly the functionality I wanted to keep all my notes in one, portable, convenient place. I haven't played with its other functions yet, but it already earns 5 stars from me!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great with my Android Tablet (samsung), I love using it in class. Very useful. Only 4 stars because you have to purchase a recurring subscription to get all the premium features. But for less than $5 (one time payment) you get the ability to write on PDF's which makes it easy to take notes during PowerPoint lectures."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much that bought premium within 10 minutes of downloading the app. I would really love to see some features though,like ability to have multiple pen colours in tool bar like in one note, And Having Calendar pre set with date instead of all blank (something like a diary page) . Overall ,great app ,kudos to the dev"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greate experience but we need more features please check the ipad app notepad they have many great features which you could make it here for us"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good functional app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app..i hope some new features in the future ...maybe u can add a zoom feature so we can write simultanously on the line"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app! By far the best app for digital notes, homework, pdf markup, etc. Excellent export to pdf capabilities. Blows Onenote out of the water!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fluid and easy to use, good value as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it in my classroom for teaching. It's great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of my favorite apps for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love this app, but there is one flaw, it doesn't auto sync across devices. There is a way to sync but it is very manual and it is very easy to accidently deleted everything. In the app, it is so amazing, just needs auto syncing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and effective for notes taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for all my engineering classes...I love it!!! I just take my tablet and that's it....love the app and love the infinite note ...but wish it had a feature that could search your notes so one could search specific words in your notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a spectacular, reliable app for notetaking on the Google Pixelbook. I am dismayed by the lack of updates bringing new features that make the UI more user-friendly on larger devices, but for $1 a month, it is solid and resonable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just wanted a simple note pad for my galaxy pad, this works perfectly for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful and useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It is very bad app for those who don't have stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best stylus type note app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I rely on this app to write notes with my S pen for lectures and subscribe to import PDFs, I love this app and would not consider changing. However, a feature to add typed text (in a text box) would be very helpful as to copy and paste from another document or to type into a worksheet so I wold not have to use another app for this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wanted to move my journaling digital and squid has been awesome for that. It's fast and responsive and I haven't noticed any kind of lag with handwriting. One thing that was initially difficult for me was the way the pages would resize while writing which is more of an ocd issue than a technical one but having pages locked to screen size by default would have made it simpler. Overall a great app. Would purchase but last time I looked it's subscription only."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great at begining, when data or the text getting longer, the app start becoming iresponsive and causing tablet malfunctioning"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My opinion is that the developers should allow text in the free version. Generally, it's a great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only reason this isnt 5 stars is because it doesnt sync between my phone and other devices. There is a work around with Dropbox- but it feels a little clunky and time consuming. Other than that it is great- I use it to read and annotate PDFs and am very happy, especially when using my note- it seems very optimized for the stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"User friendly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Updated: I was informed you can one time purchase pieces of premium which makes this app much more palatable. Also, the response time from support was excellent. After a few weeks of use: the rest of the image does not render when you are panning around the page so you're left with a checker pattern which is really distracting. After spending money on this app I'm ultimately moving on to different apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For $1/month I can't complain."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant, easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i use thisto download lecture slides andtake notes on them on my yoga book tablet. I love it! I recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hi there this is a great app! However it's also good if this app available in windows store so that i can download it too to my nextbook thankyou devs! More power!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Superb app and easily the best note taking app I've come across especially if you have a S-Pen! My only gripe with it is the cloud storage options, it only supports Dropbox and Box, no Google Drive support! Google Drive support would make it a 5 star app so hopefully they're working on this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good, is is faster, i like it, simple, ir works.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried several. Squid is so good I paid for it. I. I like that it allows me to select parts of what I write and make changes to them (colour, size, etc) without making changes to other parts. Also extremely useful is the ability to import PDFs and splice it to several different documents. Would like to see a few more features, like moving some pages of a document to a new document, moving the order of the pages, a few more shapes like quadrants and more page templates. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for writing notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really perfect. Caligraphic pen Color picker Fill with color would be my next expectation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very usefull. Use it more than s-note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. The only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the page-turning ... being able to swipe left and right to move between pages would make it so much easier to navigate. A few more pen/pencil types would also be good, but not essential. Thanks for a really well designed and useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Muy satisfecho con la aplicación la cual es perfecta para mis notas. Hace falta la sincronización."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking android app for students. Looking forward to continuous updates to make the app even more user friendly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The pressure response is a little weird with S Pen; I feel like I'm always pressing too softly or too hard but rarely getting the line width I expect. Maybe adjustable sensitivity? I would also love to see tabs to switch between multiple open notebooks and gray dot graph paper instead of blue. Has the best sync option (PDFs to dropbox) of all notetaking apps!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is great. The only major flaw is lack of ability to view the notes on my dekstop. I have to export and send to my desktop if I need a note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good general app but one issue. I can understand the some features you have to buy, I baulk at paying a subscription though, but basic functionality that you can get on other note takers basic applications needs to be included."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app has excellent potential but seems to HAVE ONE SERIOUS FLAW: You can't copy or duplicate entire notes. I started to use this in my math class and cut and paste numerous graphics into my note as I am teaching. I need to be able to save copies of the original note and duplicate them for editing and use in other classes. It seems that I can't do this. This is a most basic function. Frustrating!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, would be 5 stars if you could backup with google drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I take all my meeting notes and save them for reference later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Poor note taking app, with only 1 pen option which is kinda ugly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So close to perfect. Updates are infrequent and there is no Google Drive or OneDrive support, only DropBox. Everything else is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app of notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Chromecast doesn't work and subscription model is too expensive for basic features, it should have been one time fees. Ui can improve for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Versatile and worth the little bit each month for PDF importing if you need to take notes on PDF regularly. Great options for backgrounds, colors, etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"How save my notes??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy on the device, but jam packed with useful features! Really helps lecture notes. Save to drive is great and works well. Only thing would be the ability to expand pages in a book to infinite size to be able to make notes around it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"top"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great app, pretty much allowed me to completely replace physical without paper. Use it for almost all my organisational tasks now. D do wish it had tabs though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app although S pen sensitivity is far better in note 9 original app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would love it even more if I could preview it on my desktop without having to extract PDF and if it allowed me to sync instead of a 6 hour backup interval. Lastly, please give us google drive support!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Va lento"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A fine app except for one thing: I'm not interested in subscribing for functionality that should be included in a basic application. A one time reasonable purchase, sure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"While it's a great app, I event went for the subscription (need the fuctions for school), but I need swiping to go from page to page, and the ability to have 2 pages next to each other on tablet. That should be a given, to be honest. No idea if I'll keep using Squid. Those functions, at least the next to each other pages, are kinda important. Then I'll look for another app. Edit:// Oh, and also backing up notes as PDF keeps freezing, it won't work. At one point it shows 19/18 and just freezes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful with s-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My #1 go to app for taking quick hand written notes but, I would like to have the option to see all the tools available to make selecting between them easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. It allows me to maximize the use of my SPen more than any other app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic notes app, use it daily for work and reminders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have changed my review. For a monthly fee I get files I cannot export, open with another program or even print. What use are proprietary files, especially when i pay to make them? Found another finger writing app for less than two months of this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great when there's no access to a pen/pencil@"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Worth every penny. Only complaint would be the addition of a ruler tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was brilliant until I decided to purchase and saw that there is no one-off price but rather a subscription model. Shame, the best out there. Will uninstall now. I can't afford renewable subscription purchases. I would have paid to fully unlock with one time purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Was one of the better handwriting apps out there but struggles as the number of notes increases. Some may find the ""premium add ons"" to be a little expensive for what they do. Online backup is awful and totally unreliable. It always struggle, consume bandwidth and resources, slows my device & typically crash the whole app. I would love to see some kind of synchronising across devices too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It would be better if the notes sync in real time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best option to date for android users. Way, way, way better than OneNote. It requires just a few minor improvements, like some way of contrast increasing of highlighted text, and an option for scrolling down from page to page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So far, really like this ( when I obtain a stylus will be workable). I t seems a bit harsh to charge for a realistic eraser and to add typing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a nice tool for notetaking. I just wish it made it easier to break down an imported pdf into smaller bits."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's not what I need but on a mobile device it's not super usable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like all functions how I can manage pdf files in this app. But hope that I could find certain words by searching in the pdf files ( kinda like ctrl+f).🤔🤔🤔 This would help Squid users a lot!!! Other than that, everything is nice."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid with my tablet and a Bamboo stylus to create colourful learning summaries to support my counselling students. I particularly like the range of colours and the intuitive design."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Does everything I could want and more, works flawlessly on Samsung Galaxy Note 9!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just started, looks good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is almost perfect for my work! I use it daily to take notes on scientific papers I need to read. It is the perfect replacement for printed papers! However I would have like to be able to organise better the notes in the notebooks with the ability to create different subfolder. If this comes in a future update, it will be a 6 star app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app. I use it for note taking in school. I ended up purchasing the subscription because it became more convenient to upload pdf's. I would give 5 stars if it were free for all options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Allow for swiping between pages, especially for pdf files. Allow for custom quick colours,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost there, if only it can arrange my notes better, and can give options other than thumbnail view"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great Experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Essential note-taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great note taker. Easy to use and see on my Android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app...specially if you use the spen or any pen to write...smooth writing and simple but smart UIX."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app has worked great so far, the only thing I believe it's missing is an easier way to take notes on the app. Powerpoint has a section at the bottom of each slide that would be great in this app. I know you can type onto the slides but often times I need to type more notes than that allows or the slide is full of info I don't want to type over. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app hands-down"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the best I have used. However I would like for there to be the option of black notebook lined backgrounds too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good application, very usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Unable to convert handwriting to font"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best with stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its cool LOL"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the way it is set up and the features it has. The only complaint I have is that I cannot open more than one document at a time. So I cant mark a pdf file and take notes on another document at the same time (that I know of)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app everyday. Wish it was also available on the Iphone so I can use it on multiple platforms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, smooth and user friendly. It would be even better if the attached picture can be edited later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Changing pages is very uncomfortable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for now taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Happy to consider paying for an upgrade, however the subscription model is not something I'd would consider and since there is no other option, I'll uninstall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app has great support for handwritten notes and a great pdf import system. The text notes are definitely lacking thought. Adding think like links in text would go a long way"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A pretty basic note taking app, which makes it easy to use, especially with the great stylus support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Productive software but still could use some improvements. I like that you can vote on feature requests but I don't see any of the ones I'm interested in being implemented."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, started using it for college classes and couldn't be happier with interface, features, or performance"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately I have to use this app because there is no other choice. I'm pissed off for developer because the app does not have any subordinate function for this app. The free apps or the simplest apps have this feature, but this app does not. What is still very bad, developer wants that the user must vote for subordinate function. What shoud that? all universities are open now, when do you want to bring this function? end of study year?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would be perfect with sync ability across other devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Can't use keyboard to type. Only writing option is available."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for viewing/editing pdf files, doing homework and filling out forms electronically. It is useful for critiquing/highlighting journal and conference papers for graduate school research. When doing homework the grid paper is especially helpful for making sure I keep my handwriting clean and readable. All documents can be exported to a pdf for easy emailing and printing. One drawback is a lack of drawing tools, like those on MS paint like tools such as polygon shape builder and paint bucket."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"How can I organise my notes using a folder structure?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid on my Chromebook Plus V2 to teach my math class. Students can follow along with their own notes page that is identical to the PDF I can cast to screen at the front of class. I can keep all of my classes separated by course and unit. It's great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note for students. I study medicine and this is my go-to note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Only maintaining my subscription in hopes they figure out how to allow my info to someday be available on windows from my cloud sync on android. if that ever happens i may be a happy squid user again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Did not backup and all my notes are lost. I subscribed $10 a year to have the dropbox backup feature and it failed. Don't make the same mistake I did. Use an actual notebook or notepads. Or google notes - automatically saves notes to cloud for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Looks interesting. Could use a free trial period to test all features. Doesnt work properly on my Lenovo Yoga Book. It can't tell the difference between the pen and my hand, which is kinda annoying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When you imported pdf file these are space in those pages i wish i could wirte in those space espcially if pdf has very small page. So far best app in this category"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Completely unable to subscribe to the premium features of this app. Tried several payment methods but none of them worked. Looks like a good app, but too bad i'm not able to use the features I need because of the app not allowing me to pay!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it to take notes for all my classes in school. No more bulky notebooks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for using my Galaxy Tab S4 and using the stylus. Great job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it... it would be great if I can save as in folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I rated it 4 stars for its easy-to-use and friendly interface for college students. This app has a lot of potentials. Firstly, this app lacks tags and search for better organizations of your notes. Currently you can only group pages of notes in 1 book. Secondly, it only accepts pdf files and pictures as digital input information. Evernote allows you to capture more. Thirdly, the app does not do well enough on annotation. After all, the app targets on tablets with stylus pen and daily note-taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great package to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good and easy to use. Try it, you will love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable!! I can't customize page navigation ! I want to scroll pages!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I started using this app recently in my tab s4. I prepared some note and saved. When I took it later and while scrolling with my hand, it started erasing the notes, which I feel bad. We need to change it into view only mode purposefully to avoid the erasing. Instead, if you can make it view only mode by default while saving, it will help. Apart from that it is a super app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Device: Samsung Chromebook Pro. This app has all but replaced physical notebooks for me. I love the import PDF feature as this allows me to import uploaded note slides and pages from my online textbooks. I haven't had any issues with the app dragging to where I rest my hand on the screen so I wonder if this is a device issue as opposed to an issue with the actual app. My only gripe is I wish that subfolders could be created under the notebooks for further organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"To use any advertised features requires subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"4/5 for ease of use and versatility, but not for Left Handed People. If you curl your hand when you write then expect to exit the app in the middle of writing something all day every day. I'd imagine this would be one of the FIRST things they work on (making a writing app), but nope. Also a request for this has been around since 2013 on the support page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I used this app few days now for taking lecture notes. This are my observations: (1) bad synchronization (2) no full screen m mode, so my wrist sometimes accidentally press back /home buttons. Overall good app still need some polishing though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for school work. Would love if the tools were spread out for tablets, as it would speed up its use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"luckily could restore my file from the cloud"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Add Google drive integration"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for taking hand written notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thus far, This app has been great. I use it for work processes and inspections and it has been excellent to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great teaching tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"3rd time installing /uninstalling. Moving on to other options. Pixelbook 4Mb, no tabs open. Not able to draw anything using finger or 2 styluses that I have.Have about 15 extensions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like that this app have versatile handwriting tools and able to set page size. I am currently a subscriber for the premium too. However there are some suggestions. 1. Have more organising tiers.(right now only have 2 tiers) 2. Hope that Squid 4.0 to be released on tablet. I read that V4.0 have multi-window feature and i would need that on my Samsung Tab S4. 4. Hope to be able to change the size of the pdf page within the page so that there is ample space to annotate the file. 5. Multiple font"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Two main issues tht letme down 1) Pop-up window mode is not working properly in NOTE 9.Whatever i write, moves slightly upwards. 2) No widget where i can use a Note directly on home screen for writing. App must be opened, which is not convenient for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple the best easy to use and transfer and pull up files Only thing wish you could pull up files deleted by mistake other then that its IT'S GREAT"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for study notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for university note-taking on powerpoints! Would give a 5 star review if you could type next to pdf as well as write on them. My only complaint. But few other pdf note-taking apps for chromebook, so I'll take it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It will be wonderful if developer adds reminder tools like google notes and also add google online integration"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"On the Galaxy Tab S3. With an active stylus this app works astoundingly well. PDFs in this app are in need of improvement, it would be great if you could scroll through pages instead of having to tap through. This is especially laborious if you were to upload a PDF of a textbook. There should be a way to bookmark pages of a PDF. Another thing that would be great is if you could temporarily invert a note and the pen or highlighter ink, this would work well with AMOLED screens and battery saving."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid hai"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If small screen like picture in picture mode is available, it wii be useful for jotting down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good for study note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"UseIt in meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid everyday and love it! For lists and schedules it's the best. No problems, just a smooth working app that does what it's supposed to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent ! Perfect pair for Samsung Galaxy Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very useful. I would recommed it, but keep your notes to a4 if you are planning to print them later because with an ""infinite"" note is difficult to predict how it falls on the page. 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, but how to scroll up and down a page (if I'm not using stylus)?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super awesome note taking app. It captures your handwriting so effortlessly and accurately. 100% as though as you are writing on the paper. If only it is available on windows 10 too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am thoroughly impressed with this. It's very convenient to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Only One star because this app won't let me Backup and sync to google drive which is pretty dumb IMO."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a really good full featured writing app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, but it would be nice if you can add a presetting pens option, it would make note taking much smoother. It would also be nice if you can add google drive and an export location in addition to dropbox and box"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I purchased the subscription so I could import class slides and make notes on the slides without worrying about losing a printout. I really like this feature and the ability to add pages where I want them. I wish that I could organize things a little better though. So far it is working well on my tablet, my main gripe would be how sensitive it is to my hand resting on the screen to write. There is a lock feature, but the page will pan over or down when I don't want to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love squid :) Can you please add a rotation tool? I want to select things and rotate around center or corner."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why cant i sync between devices?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app.. thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app I have ever used. Best with a Note phone, or stylus that is good and accurate though, but using the S-pen to write and finger to erase, Shapes, color, it really can't get much better, amazing controls, user friendly, wonderful interface. A must have app. I cannot think of many things I would change other than the premium available on Play Store, maybe a few more shapes, plus the ability to select/modify a shape, still wonderful, if you have a Note, get this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"PAYWALL: coping text onto the app. This app is greed AF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Enable full screen mode while taking notes. The bottom bar keeps on disturbing. Take it to top."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's okay. There are many better alternatives. For obviously greedy reasons - there is no SINGLE payment Premium version. Instead: lifetime subscription! Every good feature is locked behind a lifetime subscription paywall. Don't even bother yourself with this app: just download one of MANY free / truly-premium alternatives. For example, microsoft OneNote. For example the AMAZING & 100% free google Keep which is the best with FREE online storage! Edit: I cant copy the link, or visit it. :["
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Read the ENTIRE description even after you see on their list what you need. It says you can write on PDFs but says at the very bottom that it's a premium feature. 5 dollars. Why hide that you'll have to pay to use it, if as soon as people see they'll uninstall your app anyways? Very lame. Same notes app as every other one, the only difference was the pdf editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful good app 👌👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app a lot! Best note taking app for sure. Some features i hope they bring in the future: dark mode (for notepad and interface), and some additional pens (the one default pen doesn't look or feel nearly as good as the default Samsung note app), and reminders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is what i am looking for! Only 2 things i needed for this app: 1. Sync from my android device to my windows laptop. 2. Set transparency of paper so i can trace my drawing on top of it on the next page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very fast learning curve."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If only I had a bigger screen. This is the best note taking app for Android available for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have downloaded and paid for over 15 applications and I can say this one is by far the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Honestly it's just as good as if not better than goodnotes, highly comparable, I recommend!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Even a simple copy-paste is not free! Deleting app after review!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like that I could pay 5$ for just PDF writing, as thats all I needed to do. Works well no issues"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Do u needa stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for creating designs to send to customers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for marking up and viewing PDF docs. Works well with the Samsung Galaxy S Pen devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This would easily be a 5 star rating if syncing between device s was possible"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It is, in my experience, one of the only Android apps that combines PDF annotation and note-taking so seamlessly. My only gripes are that it does note have an infinite, or even custom-sized page for when writing on PDFs, and that it does not directly link with Evernote. With these features, it would most definitely be the best Android app for note-naking. Please keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A nearly-great app that I use daily for teaching. I hesitate to recommend it though, as the devs will not add common features one should expect in 2018, such as page rotation and sync. Consider getting Xodo for now (which has all those features) and check back here after a few more years. UPDATE: 2019 is winding down and no widely-requested updates have been implemented. I'm migrating to Good Notes on iOS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What an amazing app - I use it with my s-pen on my tablet and it works like a dream. Free-hand writing recognition is very accurate, what a pleasure! Quick note taking in meetings are a breeze, as if you're writing on paper. I dont normally take the time to write reviews, but this appis definitely worth the effort. Well done!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes in University and I love that I can hand-write my assignments on here using my huawei tablet and easily print them out. One suggestion is that I'd like to be able to have multiple 'tabs' option so that i can quickly flip through notes that i need at the moment. and it would be great if the infinite page could divide itself into normal page sizes to make it printable later instead of having to add more pages (otherwise it gets tedious to look through notes later) Thanks!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective note taking app. Works brilliantly with my Galaxy Note 9"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Would be even better if they could add a screen capture feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Don't fall for this app, you have to pay $5 to import PDF files. Other apps don't do this. What a waste of time and money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app, tool section is not enough, eraser don't erases image conent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app in it's category which works perfectly with S Pen! I wish developers add dark theme and option to hide the blue tool box on upcoming updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good to jot down running notes and page size is extendable. Offers plenty of font colors. Decent experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"can't import pdf in free version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Many features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"La mejor aplicación para tomar notas escolares, descargue tres más antes de usar squid y está fue la que me funcionó mejor. A pesar de que requiere de subscribirse, vale la pena invertirle si tu objetivo es tomar notas de forma eficiente"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App but why having a drop down menu for the tools ? It would be easier to have it on the menu bar in the top ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The Disable Back Button function is not working on Huawei Mate 20X. Should also add another pen function - calligraphy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Reliable and fast. It is my daily driver and I couldn't be happier. And I take a lot of notes. Unfortunately, the cloud backup does not run on schedule, even with battery optimization disabled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Device im using: Google Pixel Slate. I would give this a 3.5 if there was an option for two reasons. The writing is very smooth, but if you set your notebook in pages and get near the bottom, it struggles to write smooth and it leaves dots and it lags. To me, this is a problem since I am going paperless this fall for school, so hopefully this issue will be fixed by September 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this App! I use it to take all my daily notes and keep my calendar."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app to take notas and draw"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this apps, really fullfill my need to read all the pdf note and highlight the important points. I even can make annotation. Cloud backup from box and dropbox really come into handy. by the way the publisher should consider to add the search function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, great customer service"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You have to pay $10 /year to get the pro version. You can't purchase the software outright. Therefore I'm no longer using the app at all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I hate it it is so bad every thing is with money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite eletronic note book"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"very bad app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love It!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Writing on it using media pad m5 lite is good. Stylus is very responsive though lines jitter especially when zoomed in. But this is bearable. What concerns me more is that this app lacks search function making it difficult to review a note when you have a lot of entries already. I hope they will make an update soon and include search function by file name up to handwriten words."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"next level make plz add floating screenshot capture for video lecture"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love that you can print really easily! It would be nice if there was an option for lined paper with the standard margins."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Really wish there was an option for a one time purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good enough. but could be better with better folder management"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app works great on Lenovo tab 10 and syncs perfectly to Samsung s7 edge."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! Absolutely love the flexibility I have with the app in designing and writing on docs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use, manipulate and share pdf's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"App is good for note taking.,wish it had full screen mode and the thin toolbar.,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Great app, just not for me :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App is constantly crashing my Samsung Chromebook Plus. Seems to be no logic to it (big note files, small note files, switching from landscape to portrait). Do not recommend this app at all! I signed up for the subscription because I saw a youtube video recommending this and I highly regret my purchase. I am actively searching for an alternative. Please message me if anyone knows one. Aside from serious stability issues, adding text is awkward... others too but I'm at review word limit. Stay away"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a nice app for notetaking but it would be better if there was a palm guard so that you can rest your palm on the screen when writing. I tried inserting a pdf in one of my other notes but the app keeps crashing as soon as I try that. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars. Also with the export sharing add in the option to only export certain pages like page 3 to 6 for example instead of the whole document or just one page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"absolutely in love for this app.Very helpful. is helping me to organize my notes about my classes and patients Although I love the app, something is quite not working ideal, I can't write until the end of a page. I can use about 75% of my page. my pen just stop writing, and a thick margin stays blank. I talked with my friend who told me about Squid, and hers works fine. So I wonder mine is having problems. I use a Samsung Tablet S2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"waste app.. all the cool and important features are paid.. without the premium package you can only write,erase and select..moreover there is only one type of brush available where you can adjust the pressure and size... Didn't find it much helpful..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for signing and filling out forms sent to me as a PDF!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"please provide more font option in typing section. then i will give 5 star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has been a tremendous boost to the efficiency of my business! Thank you Squid!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would like a Cornell notes template in a free version. that doesn't seem to be too much to ask"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The Best for PDF annotation. I bought Samsung Chromebook for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just a good note taking app with no fluff, recommend getting premium for added pdf and drawing features. Would like to see more paper layouts and designs in the future. Edit: Developer's care about feedback so upgraded review to 5 stars. The app isn't plagued by ads like almost every free/subscription app on this platform."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I previously gave this 5 stars but dropping to 3. It misses one major feature for a modern day notes app - synchronisation. I have multiple devices and really need to access notes on all devices irrespective of where I actually wrote the note. The developer knows this is a high priority amongst many users but has not implemented the feature despite a few years passing. I'm resorted to Microsoft OneNote for now and still searching for a better solution."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is by far in the top 3 apps I use on a daily basis, even when accounting for both work and free time. I have a Note9, and Squid is where I learned to love using the s-pen. I use it for architectural free hand, and it has easy export/share. It's more than just a notation app. I tend to try an app and find it unsatisfying, and then look for a better one. Squid broke the cycle for it's category as far as I am concerned. Excellent work devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"l'application permet d'acheter l'outil pour insérer des PDF à 6,49 environ, et autres, mais si l'on souhaite avoir plus de type de papier il faut alors acheter l'abonnement à l'année. N'empêche c'est la MEILLEURE application sur Android pour l'utilisation d'un stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works well on Galaxy Tab S4. However the Spen is not precise near the borders!!! Please, fix this problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"poor resolution on handwriting lines and doesn't seem to offer dollar value compared to the competition"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It won't let me back up to google drive, the app has begun freaking out when ever I resize it. Whenever I click to open I file the app flashes black for a couple of seconds and then shudders, moving around my screen at random untill it eventually opens up. Occasionally the stylus input is incredibly inaccurate. also the pen input sometimes wont register my pen input untill after I lift up my pen. Overall I used to like this app but there are too many problems that keep adding up. :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"pay wall beware"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. just what I was looking for. One or two enhancements would make this the perfect hand written notes app. For me this is the best app for note taking and ""filling in"" pdf templates/ forms. Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lag issue got explained. Got no solution for that yet since it's issue from Google's side. Overall it's a really great note taking app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"all u can do is basically scribble until and unless u upgrade with money 💰!😒😒😒😒😒"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite app for my Note stylus. Write with your pen and erase with your finger. Lots of backgrounds and can purchase PDF as background so you can use any PDF as a template! Lots of pen type/color options and pressure sensitivity is perfect. Highly recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not very smooth. Requires purchase to access most if the features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So happy with this app. I take notes, and love the option of copying and pasting pieces of my notes in other pages, create PDF (paying) and the wide range of templates. Though I do not know if this is only me but compared to other apps, the sensitivity when writing is a bit lower. It makes my writing a bit less readable, uncomfortable and ugly 😊. I use the pen that comes with my Tablet ASUS ZenPad, so I guess it is because of the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Good except you have to buy premium to use the app. 😠"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find Squid indespensibe at work to take extensive handwritten notes on my Samsung Chromebook Plus. The app is quite stable and reliable. The premium backgrounds are helpful for specific applications and are worth the money if you need a different type of paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would be excellent if it included a wrist guard feature. Without that everything is more painful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"absolutely wonderful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"flexible and easy to use, intiutive menu and features. the capability to import pdf is a big plus. some improvement can be made like predefined pen size, auto switch between write and erase, and the option for text mode input."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best in my opinion"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to write out everything you can't type anything on you're notes unless you pay $2.99"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing application. Great for me as a student. Just a pity that you need the premium to have the option to highlight, etc. Also wish more fonts came with the premium purchase. Overall very happy with the purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Things I would recommend changing in this app: 1. If i share a picture with this app, lets say from google, it would be great if the picture would land in the note that is currently open and not in the new note 2. add a ruled background that has a simple vertical line on the left side of the page(like in cornell basic but without the bottom horizontal line and closer to the edge) basic note backround 3. colours of the shape tools should be independent from the pen colours thats all for now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for pdf markup while retaining the pdf quality with note management. I tried a few but nothing comes close. Having the following will undoubtedly make this the top notch note taking app: 1) Search function 2) PDF page extract 3) Pen variety 4) Handwrite recognition - convert to text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app on my chromebook. It's the most responsive note taking app to the stylus on my samsung chromebook plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for spen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"can much improve thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect! I only wish there was a sync with google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple but effective"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"could be perfect if possible to open on Laptop, tks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome. User Friendly. pdf editor/ exporting / attaching images / page backdrop/are the highlights of this app. Loving to write more.Thank U Squid Team for the wonderful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the fact that I can highlight PDF's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"free app that cant do much of anything. uninstalled"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best note app i ever used (i tried many in 5 years) working so well with stylus pen and its even work well with my old n5100 notepad |> i need to edit my review and ask a very useful option, can you please add layers to each page? as im architect and graphic designer i saw a very good potential in this app but it lacks layers , thank you so much for your amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I heard about this app online but I found out that I couldn't install it on my surface pro tablet. I don't know if development of a windows application would be possible, I did download the app on my phone and I will try it out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add option to rotate selection, image etc. Also add option for drawing filled shapes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it great app, but I suggest if there is option to lock the note, and send through email. thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if there were arrows ready to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app.. easy to use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great except for 1 major flaw: There are no page markers to let you know where or how your notes will look on regular paper. If you print it, depending on your notes, it will fit them ALL on one page! I take alot of notes with this app, and when I try to print them I have to use a magnifying glass! You MUST FIX THIS PLEASE!!!!! Then it'll be a BIG 5 Stars!! Thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry but any handwriting app that doesn't have palm rejection is pointless. We don't write naturally with our hand up in the air but that's the only way I can use a stylus with this app and that is not enjoyable. When anyone goes to write, the first thing that touches the tablet is the edge of your little finger or the edge of your hand so palm rejection is an essential.  Also, jagged curves when using a stylus but that could be down to the stylus itself."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking mobile application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"So much amazing potential totally and utterly killed for me by the lack of sync with Google Drive. I want to love and use it, but I'll be sticking with s-note for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Execellent app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app from all that I've given a try."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"extremely useful for capturing ideas on the fly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"you can't type but it's a very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Good app and good stylus support, but the lack of sync makes it much less useful than other note taking applications. Unfortunately, I'm cancelling my subscription since the developers have been ""working"" on sync for years now, which is supported by many other note taking apps for free. As much as I like the app, it doesn't make sense to pay for something that's missing a major feature that its competitors have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and well designed app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"goood"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Always works consistently"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it's Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is in some uncanny valley of greatness. Writing is smooth, the interface is beautiful. But this app is missing a bunch of (basic feeling) features that'd be super useful for taking in class notes. No one-click shortcuts for switching between pens, no nested notebooks, no easy way to split notes. Looks like all these things have been requested a ton for years."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very convenient and fit my needs as student"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Favorite handwritten note app by a million miles. Not without some fine tuning or wanted features, but I stopped trying out other apps after I tried this. (gimme color backgrounds in all page formats T.T )"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid app is great. I have been using it for over 2 months. I think it would be 5 star if it allowed more manipulation of PDFs. I would like to see... 1. Ability to rotate PDFs 2. Ability to move PDF pages throughout the doc. 3. I am allowed the ability to copy PDFs and information, but the pasting option does not appear, so copy is nullified and cut is just a delete. Overall - lots to like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"this app is not download in my phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app but needs google drive sync"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"does the job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App. i'm a mathematician. i use it to draw 3 dimensional objects, graphs but i suggest you add the following 1. broken line, arcs, and to be able to rotate shapes and images 2. convert handwriting to text feature. Also the true eraser cannot clean highlights especially on imported images. Thank you for this wonderful app. I'm really enjoying it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"used it for years on different Samsung Note phones, Stylo3, Stylo4...i only buy phones with a pen and this is the best note taking app I've used!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using this for on my channel."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"charge you money foever, infinite subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to pay to import PDFs. Absolutely stupid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i am in love with it ❤ wish there were some stickers or marks i could use. but anyway its the best so far ❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Selection tool could be more precise, but rest of app has fantastic utility. Especially good at organization and tool diversity."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app. I use this daily and weekly for planning my days / weeks. it would be nice to have more editor tools for premium users. be able to rotate text, more templates, different fonts/styles. great work so far keep it up. highly recommended this app as a planner for on the go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"very high latency on likebook mimas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be perfect but no password protection. I will look at it in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the Android support only. The app is ABSOLUTELY wonderful, I love it. I can literally use it for anything when it comes to writing it down, but that's also the problem. It's because I can't access it any other way than through the app that makes it so I can't open up my apps on my computer. So I am very limited to what I can do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's solved a lot of my problems by giving me a platform that is reliable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this note app, very easy to use and i even have now a premium account. But i would have more things add which should not be difficult to add, for instance:more shape tools; also be able to rotate images; better compatibility with the Huawei-pen because sometimes i have to try twice until it recognizes the input"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad for marking up images and PDF. No comparison to Gen 1 Aople pencil. to clarify by ""bad"" I mean laggy and often lines will disappear and reappear and writing a lot and taking fast notes it is not reliable. that's on a slate and pixelbook. Would not recommend it for serious school notes. gold standard product should be Notability (mac only)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As a teacher, I find this app extraordinarily useful for class. I can have my students send me drafts of things online, edit them, and return them without wasting any physical paper. I can also digitize notes and send them online so they can keep them on their own digital platforms. Highly recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It really should be made clear that barely half of the features are available without paying for premium in the description. For those wondering, it's either $1.00/month or $10.00/year for premium at the time of this review. You can't even do a free trial to see if it works for your needs first. Very disappointing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"productive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note-taking app! Even better than the Samsung note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to transform content into usable notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"worstt"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"does what i want it to. would like to see more features in future releases."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"i enjoy sometimes just being able to write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"miserable app everything is for premium users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I wanted to try it out to see if it's any good. I tried to open a pdf and it asked me to pay. If I can't try it out first, I'm not going to pay for it. Deleted. (And if it's a paid app, just be upfront about it and charge to begin with. I don't mind paying for a good app, but a ""free"" shell of an app that only works with in-app purchases is just deceptive.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's good, but it's not excellent. Yes, it meets my needs, but there is a lot of room for improvement. It would be nice to have a cover page for the notebook, a rotating function for the images, and OCR feature for the pdf so that I can easily find the page I am looking for. Also, I hope the next update will have automatic shape recognizer; it is quite tiring to go back and forth between the pen and the shape tool. It's also really difficult to copy a page of pdf from one notebook to another."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app, would be perfect with better features to sort out notes, as well as larger integration of cloud services (box and dropbox are not enough)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great so far, very useful in multiple situations. however my one issue is when I select a note, pre-existing or new, to move to a folder for use later on, a duplicate is created, but the original stay on the main screen. I don't like that for privacy issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Android app for notes taking with stylus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hope Squid can upgrade to allow folder within folder feature...🙂"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it's the best for writing. it has helped me academically"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Being able to annotate PDF documents and save them to Dropbox is incredibly powerful. I no longer have to print out and waste paper when reviewing documents, proposals, or other materials in PDF format."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love being able to scribe and draw with this app. easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works great for marking up drawings in the field....super useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best note taking app i've found so far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"my device is Samsung Galaxy Tab S4, and this is the best app for note taking using the S-Pen. I even purchase the subscription. I've tried a lot of similar apps for note taking but for a lot of factors including: precision, filetypes to be attached, flexibility. I WISH that squid can beautify the app, the UI tend to be boring. And the most disturbing for me is there are a lot of steps to change between writing, erasing, highlighting tools. I WILL change the score to 5 stars if you fix it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for making notes!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"please add voice recorder which contains pause and resume tools. l really like your app and i give it 5 stars but there is no voice recorder for students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"THE best tablet app for chrome book. Take notes every day inclass, and projects for work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"magnificant job ...zooming range is extended ..you can literrally write or draw incredibly small details within the page then zoom out and in at other place then add something else . this feature i haven't seen in any other similar app including Samsung Stock Snote. . you will enjoy it more if your phone has got a pen . eg Samsung Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app on my phone and tablet for school note taking. It works awesome. I would've given 5 stars but I wish there was way to link account from multiple devices. That way I can see my notes from my tablet on my phone as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app, delivers the features I'd hoped existed on Android before purchasing a tablet. PDF import works excellently. Captures my hand writing accurately & legibly on my Samsung Tab S3. Button gestures make for a smooth user experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I tried EVERY other note taking app, trying to avoid a subscription charge, which I hate for an offline service.  But this is the best, infinite paper note app.  However, it NEEDS a google drive auto sync option, yesterday.  Needs a filled shape tool.  Needs to move some of the tools out of the pen menu, and into the main nav bar, when there is room (on tablets for eg).  And personally I'd like a better way of organising notes into folders, or work groups."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I use it in my class and everything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Buggy when highlighting text. App freezes frequently."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unable to scroll down in edit mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great note app. only suggestion is to add the ability to draw ""filled"" shapes. also, it would be great to be able to draw arrows."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"PUSHES YOU TO UPGRADE TO PREMIUM at every turn. want to change your pen? UPGRADE want to add a .pdf? UPGRADE cut and paste a picture? UPGRADE"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"boring"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app, wish it had Google Drive as a back up option. I generally like the ease of use and I love the multitude of paper options. managing pages in a document, both written and PDF is very easy. I assumed that Google Drive would be a back up option and didn't realize my error until after I did an annual subscription. The app may very likely be worth the price to me with that added feature, but not until then."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"use this all the time. has come a long way since it was called papyrus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I can't believe there has been a feature request open for literally years to get palm rejection added. This is a total deal breaker and it is now uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great paperless option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App! Drawing, inserting photo's, and adjusting/working between the two is very easy. Only recommendation for the development team would be to make the typing function a little more user friendly with respect to underlining, adjusting size, etc...this app has been extremely useful for a course I'm currently taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the app and it's simple in terms of use and utility. Its main advantage over other similar apps is the ability to choose the format, which is important if you ever plan on printing out your notes. I would buy it to edit pdfs since I think I would prefer it over the standard ""drawn on pdf"" application on this tablet, but unfortunately it only offers subscriptions, which I am simply not a fan of. If I could buy it for 4 bucks, I would."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's ok. A little lacking in flair and reason to upgrade to premium, and the backup services do not include Google Drive which is just bizarre. (Also seriously, why the Bible quotes...)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app but after the last update it deleted all of my files for school! Hundreds of hours of note taking down the drain:( Update!:Looking at, I believe it was the fault of a new chromeos update, the update changed the location of my squid files!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"nice app ,was using it for 2 to 3 years but developers not adding basic features similar to Samsung notes or Notability, GoodNotes4,Noteshelf2 like apps. plz add at least Zoom in window if possible, other feature like handwriting to text conversion, global text search, multiple tabs, etc.,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"amaaaazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Lock for notes or folders. This App is lacking the most basic thing needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the ability to take notes with my stylus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for contracts and marking up blueprints"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs google drive sync for the other 2 stars. We are all on a google ecosystem, make it happen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app. It is fairly easy to use with a good UI. Its not perfect and needs some updating before it gets good. For one, this is a great pen app. Probably the best note taking app for pens. It is the best for marking up PDFs and having great built in back grounds (with premium). But it isn't a great all around note app. Using text in this app is an absolute pain. When I paste text, it does not wrap at all. I can't change the shape of the text box at all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app that I've used for lecture notes. I wish the pages would scroll smoothly without the screen going blank and that there was at least one more level of folders. Otherwise, I'm very happy to have this app. I use it for work and class now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The Squid underline feature is perfect for me and my documents"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app would have received 5++++ stars if it was able to sync from one device to another. I use a Sam tab s4 and sam note9. The app works great on each device and has default setting so you are able to open a note and it is the same set up as the last. You are able to restore notes from one device to another however, if you restore it erases the current device notes. I have contacted Squid asking if they have the sync feature but unfortunatly no. Hope they add this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"really really useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I subscribed to the monthly plan to try the full package and it could introduce some more features. The most crucial one could be a scroll bar - especially for pdfs. No palm rejection. However overall the app is optimized, fast, easy to use and affordable. It is for sure the best note app that I tried, the friendly and clean UI has big points too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"why doesnt this app have spell check for chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. love the APP."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i use this daily. Everyone with Samsung note should get it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app to take freehand notes and fill out forms based on a pdf. I would like to see the ability to store templates for easy access instead of constantly making a form from scratch from a pdf. Fix that and it's five stars.  I gave this four stars and after using it I would increase to five as the app is awesome, but I am decreasing it to two stars. I am frustrated that after more than two years of use, the only real improvements have been in the background. No changes made to the user interface. I have read the long list of amazing ideas posted on their website and added comments, some ideas appear to be simple, but it appears the developer is ignoring. Steadfast, listen to your users!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think it's one of the best and easiest notes app around. You can just simply take notes....go back at a later time and add or errase something to that note....title the note to easily find it. Just plain, simple and easy to use with absolutely no hassle. I love it!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My brainstorming and scribbling go to app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty amazing price quality ratio! Missing that 5 star quality though, because of badly optimized screen paning (more on that: screen has to be still to update..? Pretty big problem, making standard vertical orientation quite annoying). Does have a fair price tag for the full program at 1€/month, and it does load new pages extremely fast, has wonderful sync options and easily keeps things in a printable format, lacks no essential tool either. Go Squid go!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"please add shortcut button to clear the page. currently u have to tap on 3 dots then page actions and then clear page. which is quite long process."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the app overall. the templates with the pro edition are great. I don't like how the syncing works between devices. you can download a backup from another device but you overwrite everything on your current device. essentially there is no merge between phone and tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice note pad app. I like the different templates and ability to import pictures and export to easily shareable formats."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love the note taking ability"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking for Android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"its not how i expected it, i can't copy paste, when i copy pasted its just big letters and i can't see all the rightings on my screen, bad thing is i paid for the tools and now i can't get a refund, it should be there's a trial first before purchase it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You must be kidding. I buy a subscription to get text and I cannot even resize pasted text. It just goes all the way across the screen useless. getting refund"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"UI is rather clunky and should be streamlined with gestures."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for annotation of my play script and score as well as production notes I have imported from Rocketbook. It all lands in squid and I can view it or annotate it there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"there should be an option for auto hide all everything i should only see the paper. the top and bottom windows distracts me. One More suggestion to add an option to remove a blank line from a ruled sheet layout created when using the eraser to rub something."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent addition to my Samsung Chromebook Plus. Best handwriting notes utility on the list from the Play store! Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice app, helps in taking notes so efficiently. I would recommend using this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best e-paper app. 10/10"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"oke"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good app, but some basic features are missing, like being able to reorder pages or notebooks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Visually appealing - yes But mostly useless. Unless you buy the app which has good features. I would recommend other apps such as Onenote by Microsoft instead!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"jd go"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app with a lot of features i couldnt live without, missing proper coloring features though. coloring with perspective guides would make this the ultimate app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A perfect app in always except needs a way to link on all devices so that whereever sqid is opened all my notes are there. This is a huge challenge to not have this ability. When you add this feature you will be beyond 5 stars! Also needs an easy way to keep all the notes backed up for easy transfer to other devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it on my Samsung Chromebook pro! on my Pixel 2 phone and pixel c tablet it is just good. The Chromebook has a nice special stylist that is absolutely amazing for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to use each option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Großartige App, super für Notizen und Zeichnungen, wenn man in der Mittagspause kreativ werden möchte."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Got this app for work. It does everything I need it to except for one thing: I'd love it if I could insert multiple PDF files to a ""note"" at one time. Make things faster..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it on my Samsung Chromebook Plus and it works flawlessly. Writing is very fluid and no lag. The option of importing PDFs and writing on them is great and also works perfectly. Squid support was quick to answer my questions and I use this to teach my third graders and at home. Probably one of my top 3 apps on my Chromebook Plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is really neat. I was looking for something like notability on Android, and this works well. I have a little trouble writing, but that could just be the phone. also when you change your view it takes a fraction of a second to load the page. overall it's great though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app deserves 5 stars through and through. You need to pay for some features but it is totally worth it and not too expensive. They thought of nearly everything... I do however want to suggest a fill colour option... It sometimes drives me crazy because you expect it to be there because they thought of everything else! It would make this app 100% awesome! Pleeeeeeease add this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It now works as amazingly as it did before, I just waited, but seriously thank you for this app! It is wonderfully helpful. [FIXED]""Hello, I recently had to reset my Chromebook. Now I can't open Squid nor access my old notes. Since I am a student and have my finals creeping closer I would like to recieve an answer ASAP. Amizing app overall and as soon as my Squid works I'll change the rating. ""[FIXED]"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Yearly fee? Not happy about that but I've been using it for a month now and it really is an incredible app. I'm able to do just about anything, it's easy to access and easy to organize. The pen and paper options are great, paper templates for pretty much any occasion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Unreliable now a few times -- files fail to save to pdfs, which makes the utility essentially useless for me. If this happens again I will have to find another application to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am an artist and a student, so paying the $5 to have access to all the things this app does was a no brainer. I use this at my job to take notes that can contain sensitive information, to keep from prying eyes. The only thing that would make this app the best app on the market is if they had a convert handwriting to text feature. Then I wouldn't have to go elsewhere for anything else. But as is, its intuitive and very worth trying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome. I tried almost all of the similar apps and this is by far the best in terms of ease of use and functionality. It's extremely responsive with no lag between pen and render."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"awesome note taking app, just wish I was also able to upload as a word doc and PowerPoint. I have to keep converting the format. Otherwise, nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is terrific !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's a great app with good accuracy and latency. However the app is stagnant and not being updated. At this stage in the development process, they should have fixed smaller issues which people are constantly complaining about on the feature forums. Things such as syncing, infinite PDF page sizes, vertical scrolling for pdf and bulk pdf export. You can complain all you want about a small team, but when you have literally hundreds of people willing to contribute money this is not an issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid money for it to upgrade before it was subscription but they wouldn't home that. Don't spend your money on it. Not worth it anyway!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Edit: Raising to 4 stars as I understand it's meant to be a simple hand-writing app. That being the case, a subscription business model isn't the right fit.  Original review: very, very basic. had to pay to unlock import PDF, cannot duplicate the PDF or edit pages within."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app and it works wonderfully for taking notes on Samsung Tab S4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the functionality but, it needs a Google Drive interface."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love using it with my Huawei Mate 20 X and M Pen. The only additional feature I'd like to see is a fullscreen mode that hides the menu bars (and ideally the android notification bar as well)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good App. Enjoying it. Thanks, Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think the pro version is one of the most useful write on pdf apps that's easy to use and edit. If there was a feature that would make this better, it would be to be able to move around the document, or pan around the document using your fingers as you pinch and zoom in as you take notes on pdfs or other documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. A good replacement for Samsung's depricated S-Note app the comes with the S-pen enabled tablets (Galaxy Tab S3 with S pen). While not as good as the old S-note it works well with the S-pen. The pro version with the different sheet types and colors are a must for me for field use. The dropbox integration for backup gives piece of mind."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App is good. Charged €3.50 to use the text writing tool if you want to buy it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this. It work seamlessly, lets you annotate pdf's without difficulty Its my favorite app for organizing lots of data."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful.. I think I'll be using it with a pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent ✅"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use the app for some X-ray analysis and note-taking for professional school. I really like the accessibility to almost everything. I am a paying member and I really enjoy most aspects. I know people have noted how it takes 3 steps to change from pencil to eraser to highlighter etc ... if that was a tad smoother it would be the perfect app. One more thing, if the backup/restore process was easier, or if it could use Google Drive. I would pay this app a lot of money :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great utility to have. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best notes on Chromebook! I use it with split screen to take notes on Khan Academy. The add-ons are kind of expensive, but over all it's a good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Purchased this app last week on a colleague's recommendation. I was not steered wrong. Beta testing shows this app -with the premium package - allows me to take unlimited notes and fully mark up imported .pdf's and photos. I had a system problem upon initial download. The developer was very helpful and timely in guiding to resolution."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The most important thing is it is SO easy to use. You don't have to be a computer genius to use it. nice format, simple changes... love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm interested but s-note still seam to be the king of note taking. But if you were to add shape recognition, charts and maybe a basic pop-up calculator, my and probably many other s-pen users money would soon be in your pocket."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app of it's kind, by a loooong shot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. If you're hesitant to buy it because you think it will be just like the Samsung Notes app, don't be. This app addresses all of the negative issues that I've noticed the Samsung app suffers from. Great for productivity, highly recommended. If only they could implement syncing across devices.... For only 10 bucks a year, you get what you pay for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome simple note apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost replace my notebook. Good job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i have been using the app long before the name changed, very reliable and easy to use.Keep it up"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please, oh please, for the love of God, let us change paper color."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Totally waste of time don't download it. Even they are not giving free of cost for trial. There are plenty of apps are there u can use it free of cost"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this one of the best apps for my samsung s3 concerning note taking and working with pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helpful for student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Great app if it actually worked, I have paid for the premium subscription, and it never fails that when I need to open a PDF document in Squid I get a message saying I need to upgrade to the premium subscription. Even after I follow their steps and hit the ""restore purchases"" button in the help section or I force stop the app, I still can't access the premium features. The only way to get it to work again is by deleting the app and downloading it again, but that causes all my notes to disappear."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried alot of apps for taking handwritten notes on my tablet. But they all had quirks and issues that made the experience frustrating. That hasn't been the case here, at all. This has been perfect for taking and organizing working and meeting notes, especially."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good and useful app for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent as is, the free version is perfectly acceptable, but also the only note taking app i found thats actually worth paying for. the only subscription i have and absolutely worth 10 bucks a year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"need to pay $5 to use their advertised feature of marking pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"boring, you have to pay to get to type/right , only drawing is free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Two stars for being a ""free"" PDF markup app where you have to pay in app to actually use the PDF markup feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. I like that it allows me to sign things and send without needing to print. Still think it could be quicker with downloading and saving things."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Better than s notes.   Use this app all the time. Haven't found one better for what I need. Love the infinity page size. Could maybe do with a little face lift  to make it look a bit more modernistic?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's pretty good. I subscribe to the service. But I feel there are some common sense improvements they can make with keeping erasing options more handy: its seems one has to do a lot of clicks to choose between erasing, changing the mode and the size. The writing, pressure sensitivity, features are pretty good. Just not happy with the interface. There are also issues with importing PDF: if you want to use this to sign electronically filled documents, the electronically filled part don't show up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Im an structural engineer and I use to make several notes and draws to specify details in construction place. So the best way is to import the pdf drawing CADS and to draw above and mail them. Is the best way to keep them organized, response fast and clear."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great for a student like my self. The premium version is worth it. So much better than onenote which unfortunately comes limited on the android store. I need to be able to mark up PowerPoint slides converted to pdf and I can do just that with this app. I would have given it 5 stars but my biggest gripe is that users cannot create sub categories or sub notebooks. I'm surprised squid lacks this essential feature. Taking notes is great but I need a way to organize my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app if you've got a pen! Also great for LaTeX beamer presentations (thanks a lot for fixing the original issue, very impressed by responsiveness of developers!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Android app for taking handwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I intend for this review to be neutral. There is no free Text Tool and therefore the App is less useful than alternatives for the purpose I downloaded this app. I don't like spending money on ""DLC"" or subscription services for apps. I can't say much about other features of the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works very well, but lacks a few key features one would have expected, e.g. search capability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Can you make an option to disable the two finger scroll option. Sometimes im writing and with the side part of my hand i scroll the page by mistake."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have used this app for years, it is great to have on the go and at home"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since using this app on my tablet... I've hardly had to use a piece of paper. Great app... fits the bill for what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it should be possible to hide the menu to have more space"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its good for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredibly useful for taking notes for classes and signing PDF documents. Only gripe is I wish you were able to backup your documents to Google Drive, but it gives you the option of Dropbox and Box which aren't bad choices. Super quick to register, lots of options to keep notes organized, and comfortable to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"so powerfull i like infinity page feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"but bamboo paper captures my handwriting pretty much accurate"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"charges money for simple features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT!! has cut my use of paper in half!! so progressive, i work,in High-tech and so many people wanna know what this is im using."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works well on samsung tab 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In the main screen, being able to have the ability to colour code notes (including inside folders). Also sub folders would be nice. Can you add a free template for an address book? Needs the ability to import S Note / Samsung Notes SPD files as Samsung screwed up on features on Samsung Notes. I will definitely get the upgrade should this happen. this needs the ability to put files on a MicroSD card to save internal memory."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"You have to purchase it for better customization otherwise it's ordinary"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app, definitely worth it's subscription fee. I'd really love to be able to cut from pdfs though - that's a very important feature simply missing in this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. i almost never use paper now. Can you make it so we can permanently buy a background? instead of subscribing to premium just to get one background."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app + a computer or tablet with a stylus has made taking notes for class and keeping them organized a million times easier, plus my backpack is about 1/4 of what it used to weigh now that all my notes and books are digital. Only downside is that when I use regular paper and need to erase something I now instinctively go to click the ""undo"" button first before reaching for my eraser."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love to use it,is there a way to synch it across devices?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Edit: The developers gimp users [leaving out] necessary features and no real updates like bookmarking pages or a simple task as duplicating a notebook. Those have been requested feature for years yet nothing has come from development. . . . . It's a good app for taking notes. Other things I would like to see are: (1) hide the Android navigation bar on bottom when writing, (2) ability to put shortcut for Squid note folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent pen app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An incredible App to have in a classroom to teach mathematics to students. It brings learning to be colorful, and interactive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, is very useful. My only complaint would be the text box, it would be better to add text directly to the page and not through a text box."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"the cut (or scissors) tool is trash, and the squid often turn my chromebook black for whatever reason."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app for my chromebook. All it need is regular updates and new features time to time. The new features come in very slow. One advice to developer is to keep track of your competitor apps like Notability and work on getting those features to this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app, hands down. I use it for taking notes during school on a Pixelbook and there is no lag, has exactly what I need, and the interface is inituative and fluid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"seems to be back to its great self again thanks for your support Mike"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I don't like to use subscription apps. Can't use pdf without paid subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for taking notes and annotating PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just Loved it! It has overcome all the downsides of every other Notebook apps available in Google Play store!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"report to google is paid app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, very intuitive. The one feature I would change apps for is full screen. When using this app on a Note 8 in landscape view the extra screen real estate taken up by the controls is significant."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Is there an option for multiple PDF file import?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"my mostly used handwriting app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"for sure the best pen-app | found. could offer faster and simpler way to change from peu to eraser to select etc, e. g. a configurable tool bar. Thank you for a great product!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When you choose any other paper, automatically that colour changing option goes out and doesnt get displayed. how do i change it to checkerd black? unnecessariy i paid for the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this product on a Google Pixelbook and its met expectations. I can import PDF documents and write notes or use it to sign documents. The copy and paste function is amazing. I hope they upgrade it in the future to allow different pen types. I tried several differnt other apps for this same purpose but settled on squid as meeting my needs the most."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Inkredible feels much nicer to write. this is pretty basic and ugly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"good app for hand writing. please consider improving the HIGHLIGHTER. it makes the letters less visible instead of making the word or sentences pop. also it would be nice if there is a handwriting recognition for drawing simple figures like circles and lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My go to app for using pen for notes and diagrams and simple sketches"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for working with PDFed books. Love it for jotting my notes, adding photos, scribbling and drawing. I wish there was a choice of pens, pencils amd brushes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"how do you cancel subscription?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE it, with one significant caviat. The good: Awesomely low latency; huge selection of formats, great editing tools, easy PDF uploading. If you have a Chromebook with a stylus, this app is a must. The caveat: The app does not sync to the cloud by default, and Google Drive is not an uption. I learned this the hard way- lost my notes when my Chromebook decided to factory reset itself. It would be awesome if it synced to Google Drive by default."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Pen works really good. No support for templates, notebooks are not copiable and no deeper hierachie possible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a modest Samsung tablet, with squid, I don't need anymore to do my work super efficient taking notes and including certain files from google drive, evernote, among others."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note-taking app on my Pixelbook. Works well on my Samsung tablet, also."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good for writing notes in a hurry. my wish list would be to be able to delete blank lines or gaps where I've removed information. also I've accidentally deleted information when I touch the page with my finger and there's no safety net"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Worked when I first installed it but hasn't been opening images for annotation for several months now. A bit disappointed. It has potential if it worked as it did when I first installed it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"you will need premium for almost everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent application, got rid of bulky construction plans and use this for all field inspections."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"keeps closing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"लजवाब"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great tool for preparing lectures."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"not possible to hide bar, does not support recordings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Utility application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was great until it started crashing in the last week when trying to open. Now I can't open it at all. Considered uninstalling and installing again but then I'd lose what I have saved in there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The writing experience is amazing, but the inability to have subfolders is a big drawback. I like how lecturenotes allows you to have subfolders and organize notes better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"can not touch the screen with your hand"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Delivers on performance and usefulness. Great App to Supplement the S Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app so far. Been using it alot to take notes and not need to take a notebook anywhere I go now. using it on a Samsung tab A. Would be nice to have a feature where we can permanently rotate a PDF..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"bad can even take notes with out paying for somthing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Edit 2: Nice non-apology. You guys can keep your monopoly on handwriten note apps on Chromebook, I'm switching back to Windows with OneNote.   Edit: Developers have sat on the app without providing new features. Subscriptions are a two way street, users pay developers a reoccuring fee in return for improvements. Sure there is the occasional ""bug fix and optimization"" update, but where is the Google Drive sync? Where is the handwriting search? Compared to other apps like LectureNotes and OneNote, Squid is very minimal and honestly it just doesn't compare.   Compared to LectureNotes, the pricing for tools is a somewhat big investment. LectureNotes lets you get all the features with just 1 payment while this makes you pay separately for tools, pdf import, cloud, etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall, this is a pretty great app. It almsot always has very low latency when writing with the Pixel Pen. However, there are times where it stops reading the pen altogether and then whatever you've written will not show on the screen for about a second. It doesn't happen too frequently but happens enough to make it an annoyance."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"[Updated] This is my favorite note taking app. I would give it 5 stars but it doens't have Google Drive Cloud Backup intergration. Only Dropbox and box are available. It also does not sync well between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid so far has been a great product that meshes great with any device I've used it on so far. The developers seem dedicated to their product and seem to take feedback from end-users very well. There is one feature that it lacks currently but seems to be in the development stream based on the requests on the portal regarding a quick-access menu to select frequently used tools instead of having to adjust the values manually each time. I'm hoping that's added soon but otherwise it's fantastic!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very functional"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"to access eraser tool is not smart. we should switch many times between eraser and pen. the best way, both should be separated with one click access. now i am looking for another one in playstore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The basic app is a good, simple, note taking app. My issue is with the monthly, or yearly, subscription. Squid offers nothing to warrent a subscription, or anything that can't be found in other apps for a one time charge, or free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best and most useful apps I've ever used. So much more productive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for my Pixelbook!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its realy a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Full of features and easy to use in a variety of situations."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Backup Options. The application is very suitable and usable for my needs, however the backup options are very limited and should the 2 cloud options not be selected, the PDF function cannot be utilized. Why not consider Onedrive and drive as cloud backup options?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"not good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost as good as S Note. It supports the use of Real Pen on my Yoga Book nicely. The one thing that would make it better, in my opinion, would be the ability to group documents into actual 'books' or journals like in S Note. That would give it a real notebook/journal/sketch book feel. It would be great to choose covers, etc. and to not see a ton of individual documents upon opening. Love all of the paper choices in premium version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Buggy on pixelbook. It is okay. Crashes every now and then and will freeze up. Sometimes the pen will lag. I wish you had the option to scroll through the pdfs instead of having to hit the arrow every time you want to turn a page. It would also be nice to be able to have files within other files (subfiles). Right now you can only organize your work so much which is frustrating. It works, but I have issues with it almost every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"EDIT March 2019. This really is the superior handwriting app for my Chromebook. I would still like cloud backup to my Google Drive. Id like an option to double tap the screen with my stylus and immediately switch back to my default writing medium. I think it's cumbersome to have to click the button to get back to writing after highlighting or whatever. I also want a college ruled layout with the traditional pink margins on the left and right side. Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best, like no other."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So much better than OneNote. So much easier converting notes to other formats so others can use them. Now if only it could read the .one file format. The note app that gets that down will be an instant success."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"paid not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It needs the option to export a range of pages as well as specific pages by number (image and pdf)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for years - simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love the app. Use it on the daily for my job. Only knock is not having the notes readily available via cloud but thats a minor issue for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is good at the moment, I just wish they will allow infinite scrolling to next page instead of clicking the arrow button"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even though this is not optimised for e-paper displays (as Android doesn't officially support those AFAIK), I use this on my Likebook e-reader as its built-in notes app currently has a bug that results in lost pages, so despite this not being optimised, it's mostly usable, and if I can get a tablet with the features I actually want, I'll also use this there. Only downside is having to pay to get templates and pen true erase, which is already included in Likebook notes, but I can live with that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please provide page swiping option while reading mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"App has been working fine, but now it refuses to open on my Galaxy S3 tablet, and I only receive errors stating ""app keeps stopping."" Have rebooted tablet numerous time to no avail. There is no current update available for the app, and until it decides to start working again, well, I may have lost all my notes. Update: App still refuses to open, and I've uninstalled it. Lost all notes in the process. No point in reinstalling now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best for galaxy tab s4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Get it job done. I would like more sharing and organizing capabilities to the notes taken. Major development in common apps integration should be done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is probably the best app for writing on a 2-in-1 or tablet. Google Keep has much better search AND cloud storge so your notes are available on any platform. Squid is local only. I also prefer the infinite vertical scroll on Keep that doesn't scroll infinitely horizontally. All that being said, Squid's writing tools are superior. The single feature that keeps me using Squid over Keep is the PDF import. This is a pay feature but I find it INVALUABLE to import PDFs and notate them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The developer has done nothing with the app for the last 2 years and we currently do not have any support for Google Drive Cloud Sync nor Device Synchronization.  They have been ""investigating"" and casting blame on google for two years now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this gives you an actual notebook experience with your galaxy note 9. really wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It could be better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent App. Very intuitive. Luv the ability to select additional functionality individually."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"switching between erase and write is a pita. and no palm rejection. basic functions are poor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"guys , ""FiiNote"" is most best app for note on android get it !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Still the best option but has poor support for chromebooks. I frequently get app crashes and jumpy writing with my active stylus (HP Chromebook x2, similar results with the Samsung Chromebook plus)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good for taking notes and/or drawing and sketching on the galaxy s4 tablet. I have only used the free version so far as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The developers misrepresent capabilities of the basic version. Let's get this straight- all it does is handwriting and insertion of images. Pay $5 for typed text (free with samsung note devices, which go one better with OCR). Pay $ 1.50 per month for write on pdf (free on Acrobat Android). All this is only apparent after download, which seems devious. On the positive side Squid allows multiple pages which is missing from samsung."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Hooh I should have read the reviews before downloading. I just want to write notes with my keyboard. But no I must pay."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was really keen on using it, but can't even paste text to transfer notes from previous note app - really? Will uninstall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a wonderful note-taker, there is no question about that. I gave it 4 stars because it is not inter-device capable, i.e. it doesn't sync (but, admittedly, feel a touch guilty about not giving it 5 stars)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would really love to see swipe to change page during viewing imported PDF file, even on annotating mode. This is the best app on my Pixelbook for the times I want to do some reading. the ability to scribble some notes during the process is very nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for students! Although it would be good if they added more perfect shapes like you can do in Microsoft Office and better cloud features would be appreciated as well. Still it is a very good one and worth your money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't even try out the markup features of pdf files.. The developer must have provided full featured app atleast for a few days for potential buyers decide before purchasing it.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything a notepad app should be! Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time. I love that I can take notes in my own handwriting electronically and, with the paid version, have them automatically backed up to Dropbox so I can access my notes from any internet-connected device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool apps! Love this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't live without it for calculus homework. Wish they would eliminate subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Makes you pay for basically all the features - classic bait-and-hook scheme. I'm uninstalling immediately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"bullshut"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice for taking notes, but lacks text recognition and sometimes lags significantly. I would also appreciate having the ability to clean up shapes and diagrams."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best stylus supporting note taking app I've been able to find. I've been using it for years now and continue to be very happy with it. Originally had it for taking notes on my tablets, have since moved to 2-in-1 chromebooks and the experience is better than ever! Developers have always been responsive and put out regualar updates which is always good too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use paid for yearly and get tons of useful features, mostly because of its vector rendering."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bought the subscription to help support developers. This is the best app for those with stylus pens like the Samsung Note 4, 5, 8 & 9! Works perfect and has easy to find features. Should be the stock app on all phones with a stylus! The only thing I would add is the ability to import pdfs on any page of an existing note, without having to create a new note just to import a pdf. *Revised* This feature is also available...thank you Developers!! Amazing app! Highly recommend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it would be lovely if we can scroll between pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT!!!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for notes I gave 4 out of 5 because of the lay out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"pretty great; should include more features similar to CAD."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well, easy to make notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Scratch my previous review. This app gets 5 stars from me. Thanks to the support team"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Pixelbook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I recently bought the tool pack from in app purchases and I was expecting much more control over the TEXT tool. For example it could automatically arrange the text I copy in the form of a paragraph instead of a single line that goes in one direction. And apart from this, if there was a dark background option, that would have been also nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome note taking apl. very convenient"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best note app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"so good for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall, an excellent note-taking app! The ability to use styli and fingers for different actions is very intuitive, and editing works like a charm. The somewhat inconvenient UI (which always requires more actions than seem necessary), very limited selection of brushes, clumsy text and shape tools, and lack of cloud support (cannot read from or write to Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.) keep this app from a 5-star rating. But all in all, one of the best apps of its kind."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great For Study"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"perfect to be use with my chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"App is simple and has just enough features to be useful to the average person. Overall I like it.   My only question is:   Are there plans to add Hyperlink functionality to the software? I would like to be able to include links in the notes that I take. I would be willing to pay for it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy, good number of options, good range of colors and easy transfer. love how you can add pdf as pages into a document and vice virsa"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good app to make notes on pdfs. Would be great if it included being able to make notes on Word docs (bit annoying having to convert everything to pdf first)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best program every for University Students - just wish it had a night vision setting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simply awesome , and by the way i was wondering if is there any option for rotating shapes ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the best note taking apps. Definitely 5 stars if they add Google Drive as a cloud storage option and the ability to hide the dock on a Chromebook when taking a note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very happy with it. Wish you could buy the templates you wanted, not have to subscribe. Won't be subscribing, likely would have bought a few. Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very good note taking app and very smooth and"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this everyday for taking notes and as a whiteboard of sorts in the classroom. It's also great for signing and returning attendance sheets and contacts in PDF format. Friends who use Apple products are jealous (which is the most important aspect) that they don't have an app that can do the same. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Substitution for Microsoft OneNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"worse than notability, be notability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great apps for heavy hand written user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I loved this app. Then it said it couldn't open a bunch of my old notes and that I should contact support. Then all pages in all those notes changed to be the empty default page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pros: Excellent Excellent handwriting/sketching program. Simple controls and responsiveness. I can't find another program that achieves the simple stuff so well. Cons: Originally paid for full access, then went to subscription model, which I was a bit disappointed in (given original purchase). I like the program but have removed a star as progress has been slow this last 12+ months. Needs some new features and refinement of existing ones."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"awesome app for writing with s-pen. can't survive without it. extra bonus, it doesn't have stupid notifications about stuff you don't care anyway."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very very useful.....I enjoy it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great to get you in to stylus tableting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would prefer it if there was some way to access our notes online instead of exporting as a PDF and searching through your files to find them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My favorite of all the note taking and PDF readers that allow me to mark up documents. Wish it could sync across devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app I always use it to take notes I just wish they'd add more features to it like a recorder and also add more varieties to the type of files that I can upload"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent! This is the app I just wanted to taking my Notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am an electrical Engineering student and I do all my homework on a tablet with squid. it works really well and can also be used for taking notes in class. i tried all the other note taking apps and this one is the best for school purposes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Lags in response to my touch, touch not consistent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful app, integrates well with stylus usage. Cloud storage, gesture navigation and the ability to change the colour of your paper would make it better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Of all the drawing/note taking apps available, this one sadly has a horrible case of delays for writing results to show up. It's been like this for months without a fix from the devs. I'm honestly disappointed that even though Google Play promotes this app for Chromebooks, the devs don't refine it for that form factor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app for handwriting on phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Using paid version, but still needs more improvement (which I will happily pay to support). Not perfect BUT still better than all android note apps. Android users are demanding notability & goodnotes equivalents and practically throwing money at any apps/developers and begging for even the simplest functions of those apps. Suggestions page to request certain features on Squid is of no use. Several yrs of requests by hundreds of users with little/ no response from developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My 2 year premium app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Doesn't fully uninstall - keeps opening app in playstore when clicking on Smart Select. Grr!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"used to work well but now i cant even import a picture or change page size and shape since last update 🙁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for studying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Lacks some of the annotation tools, such as arrows and stamps, that are available in apps like Xodo. Have also had an issue with portions of text on imported PDFs disappearing after export - very bizarre. However, export tools are superior and far less messy than apps like Xodo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm not crazy about subscriptions, but this app is the only one with the features I need. Great for designing furniture and cabinets on graph paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extraordinary. Well fits me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Is there a feature to sync notes between devices? Also, having Google drive backups would be a great feature. I really love the app but no sync and unavailability of drive backups is becoming a headache. Samsung's default S-Note app has the sync feature, which is essentially a extremely similar app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"pretty good, but could be better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good app, recommand for you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app for Galaxy devices regarding handwriting by far. it's lacking essential feature like live synchronization and editing remote documents, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It didn't really do what I wanted out of a PDF editor. Maybe if I wanted to spring for the premium subscription, but I really can't do that right now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"it is good but there is no eraser options only undo can you add then your customers will increase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"seamless scrolling of pages is not available in landscape mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The way the features are implemented makes this the best out there right now for the Tab S4. I would LOVE to see nested folders or simple features like duplicate page in note, duplicate note in folder, and full screen in Samsung DEX. I get occasional problems where lifting my palms off the screen will scroll the note to the other side of no man's land, which is frustrating. The scrolling and zooming in general is also a bit clunky, but overall this is a great notetaking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app not gonna lie is terrible. You have to pay for it in order to just write. Who wants to pay to write notes when there are different apps out there that you do not have to pay for. Also even if you were to 'upgrade' it still really lags, is not the best at actully saving the notes, and is really complacted to write with. I would rather just write on notebook paper. I'm not usally this negitive but this app sucks. I'm sorry but i refuse to waste my money on this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice feature, but expensive. Using this app everyday for almost a year, I don't see much improvement òn the app's feature. I wish they would create some kind of favorite tools menue that will save time when I need to switch between tools/colors."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT for taking notes on blank documents and PDF's! Easy to use for editing, and organizing files. Everything I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Not good for note taking. You can only view one page at a time and have to spend more time clicking around to get to a page. I don't like how it takes me to my recent notes page every time I open it. There are barely any customizeable options. This is a stretch but adjusting the textbox every time you want to type something because it doesn't fit on the page is so irritating, especially when you're in a lecture and the professor is talking fast. There are no quick transitions from pen to typing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it with s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Trash. They want you to pay an annual fee or a one time $3 charge to add text to a note. Yet, you can add pictures, draw and do other things, but you have to pay for text..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it is very useful and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very good for taking notes, you can reprogram the pen button aswell as your figure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! This app is easy to use and has great features. I love it and use it all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most realistic pen to paper feel I have found. Truly like having a notebook on steroids with me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app I can find for android!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"don't rate things often, but this app is fanstastic on my chromebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you use a real stylus, not just a finger replacement, this app is the way to go. Realistic writing, drawing. Perfect for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"works well but no Google drive integration. I would buy the premium version if it had it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app! It needs finger/hand scrolling for PDF viewing though. Scrolling through pages pressing the arrow buttons every time is inconvenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry but as a writer there is simply no sense in having an app I can't save my work in and access from another device. If this option were available, I'd give Squid 5 stars as I loved everything else about this app 🤷‍♀️"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for classes that require graphs like econ or math courses. Wish the app had Google Drive support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost a five star for me. I signed up for monthly premium to get additional templates and also enjoying the backup feature. If they would add support for PDFs with links (this would open up app to using PDFs designed for Goodnotes or Xodo) and quick link/select for two or three pens and highlighter, would be a productivity boost for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and stable application. Make drawings using freehand or shape tools. Optional grid screens make proportional sketches easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"didn't like that I had to use s pen ....prefer fingernail"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Severly lacking compared to iOS GoodNotes. Came from an iPad Pro and an avid user of GoodNotes and Notable on iOS, this app is OK, but lacking many features and usability of the iOS apps by a long shot. Yes, I'm an android phone fan, was attempting to get away from iOS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for notetaking and recording important info. Premium templates are amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it on chrombook pro, works well and the stylus support is great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I can't highlight in the free versio & it takes up too much battery"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I didn't like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If I had more flexibility in creating default notes, I would give 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is great on my Note9. It would be nice to have Squid available for use on my Windows Surface as well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Luv It"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I *love* this app. I've been using on my Acer touchscreen Chromebook, and it has been amazing. I import PDFs from class for notetaking. If the class gives me a powerpoint, I can convert that to a PDF easy enough, and then import it. You can also do screen captures from digital books or websites and paste into Squid. It works great with the Wacom Feel stylus that came with the Chromebook. I've use this app multiple times a week for about a year now. Only downside: no writing to text conversion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"50 stars, this is a great tool! Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Write with stylus, done, no need for ""save"" Pity no sub folders, would've been greatest since slice bread. Also longer pages would've been great. Love it though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful and reliable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is great when used this app but It has a little wrong that highlighted I cannot erase some parts this must erase it all only. Furthermore, I want to have book cover and can merge file. Finally, I need highlight don't write over on text when used. I hope developer team can fix my recommend and I will get back up star after you fix my recommend thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"free version doesn't let you write on pdf. can't even try to see what it is able to do so not purchasing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Solid Notetaking app... However the app doesn't support split screen. I would find that incredibly useful as I am a student. Being able to take notes while a web browser or online textbook is on the same screen would be very convenient. Any chance this is in an upcoming update? Thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easily the best handwritten note-taking app out there. Should be the first thing installed by any student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far Squid has proven the best note taking app for Android I have tried. On my Samsung Galaxy Tab S3, it works seamlessly with perfect palm rejection (I am a left-hander). The infinite page size is great when drawing diagrams or schemes in chemistry. The copy and paste function within the software works very well as does the single finger erase which alows for very quick modification of sketches. I only wish for a more compact pen colour selection bar for improved screencasting in class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"good note-taking app, but need note cover to easily nevigate"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"amazing app.. help me a lot with my job as online tutor.. wishing the line can be a bit smoother.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"superb .. very convenient. except that it doesn't integrate well with smart select on samsutab s4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes on a chromebook. Excellent stylus support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using squid with my samsung chrome book pro has been truly a pleasure to work with. I am able to open PDF's, sign documents and take notes all in one app. I would recommend its best use is with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life. Killer templates, great integration, Desktop integrating would be cool though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The interface and everything is great but the writings are not smooth when you zoom in on them. They look like made out of straight lines rather than smooth curves."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Não tem como mudar a fonte."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs a Text Transcription Feature and possibly more pen options. Otherwise good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for freestyle journaling!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I reduced my 4 stars to 2. Needs folder support (or you just end up with an unnavigatable list of notes like i have!), and full cloud sync. Still not developed in over 2 years of use. This could be so good but it's not being developed. For a paid for app, that's bad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good. has a lot of functions and settings and supports stylus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything I wanted in a notetaking app for my tablet. ❤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After my Note 7 was somewhat peeled from my hands I have been handicapped as an engineer, mostly because I couldn't take notes like I was used to doing with Squid. Long story short, got my new Note 8 (and now Note 9), restored all my old Squid notes, very happy and productive again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for handwriting. I enjoy taking notes on my digital devices, and this is the best one I have tried"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is super useful for editing PDFs. You can mock them up in various colors, various pen widths, etc. There is no pen lag--couldn't be happier :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"dont state thats its free when you need to pay to import the pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it I even got premium for 1 dollar a month"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a ""must have app"" for every student with a tablet compatible with some sort of stylus or s pen! Fantastic for making handwritten university class notes on the fly. I love all the different page options, templates, and sizes. The default page settings is a productivity booster. I personally upload the files as pdf's to Google Drive to have access to them from all my devices. I just *star the notes I still need to upload. This app has allowed me to go completely paperless as a student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very intutive. I use it frequently."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has worked great importing PDFs to markup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easily the best handwritten note app for my note 8. I hate other apps that force me to type, and the paper sizing here makes it easy to practice zettelkasten. only improvements I'd want would be the ability to tag and wiki link notes, but this does what I need without those."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"In my opinion 2 things are missing that are key for this app to work for me on my note 8 #1 A Reset view to quickly return the page to a predermined zoom or position #2 The page takes 1/2 a second to load when zooming. Its urderstandable in infinite mode, but not in A4 or A5. Without this two items I feel my work flow is disrupted enough, and thus, does not justify paying for it. Worked well enough for quick notes, altho the standard s-pen software feels better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is great but could you make the scrolling, panning and zooming in and out within the page smoother? It lags quite a bit!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for notetaking for school on the pixelbook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm giving this 5 stars but really it should get 4.5. I wish there was more to it. For example I wish there was more tools. I upgraded to premium and the only other pen tool was a highlighter. I absolutely love that it only takes S Pen input and not my finger or hand when I write. I've also seen people say there should be a way to make folders in other folders. That would be extremely helpful too. Also the ability to rotate selections."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"i don't like the idea of having to subscribe to unlock special tools. sure, i do one time payments but not subscriptions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid works well and can be quite handy when you want to write a note. I can never find paper. I'd recommend this app to my friends."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does what I need for my math classes. I only wish there were more organizing for your work such a folders>sections>papers. etc. things begin to get cluttered with what is present right now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is one of the best note taking apps out there, and I enjoy using it. You can import pdfs and annotate them and organize your notes in note books, but there is one thing that bothers me the most. Up close, the strokes of the handwriting are actually quite jagged, which messes with my handwriting. I have seen other apps that do not have this, such as LectureNotes, and I understand it's something not initially noticeable. However, I just wish that the input strokes were smoother."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Freeze on Pixelbook.  I experience freeze for several seconds in every 1 or 2 mins. I'm using the latest version of chrome os. Please fix it ASAP."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"exceptional"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"weast"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My ""adonit Jot Pro"" scriber performs very well on Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall, It's a pretty efficient note taking app. Lots of colors for ink/ highlighting options, import pdfs/export notes as pdfs (very cool), plus uploading to my google drive. Tons of different paper options as well. The only thing I wish it did better was straight lines and shapes. As a physics major, I do alot of diagramming, and would ideally like straight lines. In order to make straight lines or perfect shapes, you have to entirely select a different tool, then switch back to the regular pen. And even then you can only choose between two shapes and straight lines. I wish this were a) more seamless or atleast b) provided more options (like circles instead of just elliptical objects), or parabolas (or even better graph plotting!), or maybe just stars and stuff. But that's really the only complaint I have with it. Everything else is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"i like this a lot, but lacking capabilities in the text tool. i should be able to control the extents of the text box. also would be helful to have a textbox with arrow tool. if this could be added squid would be an architects best friend and id be able to make this my primary note taking and pdf editing tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth 4.8 rating, easy to use, full of features, convert formats, destroying competition, best than Xodo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"very good app but recently local backup and restore function is not working. unable to switch devices. would give 5star but not for this update"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been lamenting the fact that Samsung took away the SNote and replaced it with Samsung Notes with far less user friendliness than the SNote. Alas I came across the Squid after a bit of frantic searching. I wished I could speak to some developer about what kind of a Note taking app I wanted as a student who can't carry books wherever he went. I dare say that I no longer miss my SNote. This app went beyond my imagination. I like the fact that I can load pdfs and add pages when I need to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"lovely...in all aspect...best thing is that it can be installed on memory card....hence no dependency over internal memory."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Revised my review... It is a good application! Tested other note apps with my note 8 and I think this is the best. Although I like Inkredibles overall layout and options to change the background on the fly、 this app just writes better. It's very good. Even erasing is easier. Not a huge fan of subscriptions(for premium) but I will say it is reasonably priced."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App is easy to use and gives good functionality to write on PDF documents. Easy to create folders to organise documents"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I own a Note8 and the defaut ""write on PDF"" app doesn't have the ability to add blank pages to PDF documents for additional writing space. I was hesitant purchasing this as many other PDF marking apps do not support the s-pen well but I decided to take a chance and this app is everything I wanted. I wish there was a free 10 day trial, but I do not regret my purchase. Highly recommended for Note users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, especially for phablets like the Samsung Galaxy Note series. I would recommend this app to those who have decided to root their device and run a ASOP Rom."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried several handwritten notes app. Squid gives me more flexibility and ease of use. I just hope there will be more templates available in the future,."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take notes for college and premium is worth every penny!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best application ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"insert image doesn't work so well on the Axon M and doesn't work with screen extension. but it might be great on other phones"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"worst app dont downliad it. it asking 300 rs for using pdf import"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"needs infinite scrolling on imported pdf's and a ctrl+f feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Missing a load of features that are available from other competitors."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"lol everything requires premium subscription. are u kidding me? At least make it as a one time payment, i started to hate all subscription apps like your idiot note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You cant import pdfs without paying. Yet its in the apps title."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is just so intuitive. pen to write and erase, finger to pan. enough said"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not able to cancel subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a beautiful app that allows me to take all of my notes and do my assignments in one place. Subscription is super cheap too and is easily worth the investment."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the drawing/erasing in this app is smoother in this app than any other, you can have black backgrounds instead of white(which is nice for a dark theme person like me, plus it's easier on the eyes) , and I ended up paying the < $1 per month for cloud sync capability.. so I can see all my school notes on my Note9 when I'm cramming before a test!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"in general it is a good app. suggestions: * when you import a pdf, sometimes it take some time to update screen when you move around the page. it shoul be more fluid. * please include a way to move across pages by sweping on the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"just perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for school and teaching. I work and go to school at a CSU and this app has all of my notes and allows me to showcase notes and problems in class while teaching, then simply export as a pdf and upload for the students to reference later. Awesome app! Wish it had more writing tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love using Squid! It is fantastic for brainstorming, taking meeting minutes etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"makes my work and home projects so much easier. take a pic of a wall, write dimensions on it, add next wall next to it. unlimited sheet size is brilliant and the export to pdf is amazing. fantastic app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"mudah dipakai"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good app for Samsung tab S 3. writing is amazing. I expect a handwriting recognition feature which seems missing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app is great with s pen. actually it is better than samsung's original note app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's good but a few user experience issues hold it back, particularly page turning."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This program is very user friendly. The only down side is that you can not search the files unless they have been exported to another program. I like the fact that there is more than 3 colors to choose from as far as highlighting and pen color choice; sometimes color coding is necessary for slides."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best pen note-taking app...hands-down!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I got this on my Kindle Fire and paid for the premium before realizing I can't sync to my phone.. and even have to pay for it separately if I want it on both devices.. sigh                                RE: their response:  BUT you could provide a code to unlock it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think this is a great app, and I can't find anything like it where i can mark up my pdf notes so nicely. I paid for the pdf upload version, but now there is a black bar that flashes across my screen when I am working in the app. this is so frusterating especially since i just got it last month. help!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app and it has been my saving grace for writing on top of pdfs for school. I used to print them all! However, without syncing between devices I can only give this a four star. My rating will definitely change once syncing is added."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note talking software"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wirks brilliantly on the pixelbook without lag. Nice formats, so easy. I can't see the notes on my phone though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app. I use it for my notes in nursing school. Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect match for spen devices. The app has a fast response to spen movements."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best note taking app for active S-pen of samsung chromebook plus. There is no lag, and very very sensitive. S-pen works even better than google's own Keep with Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it would be great if they could add support for erasing on s pen through a button click"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great Application! I really enjoyed using it. Squid runs very fast and smoothly. 1 Star is missing because of no multi device synchronization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app but more features should be added. Yearly subscription fee is required not just a one time fee. New features should be added. A binder feature so I can keep all notes, pdfs from one class together. Also sometimes the app is buggy when zooming in to write, it will crash or where I'm writing on screen isn't where the writing shows up on the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app helps me keep track of notes in one convenient place. The pen on my chrombook work great with this app, very smooth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exvellent note taking experience. I use this on my Samsung chromebook with the S-pen, by far the best feeling notes app on android. I subscribed to the pro mode for over a year but unsubscribed because the PDF functionality is lacking. The fact that I couldn't highlight pdf text for copying made multitasking a pain. Also the way text insertion works uses too much wasted space on big screen tablet devices. If those two gripes were fixed I would happily support the developers by subscribing yearly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Missing automatic Google Drive backup option and ability to make sub folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great selection of templates, easy to use, accepted by most teachers I have encountered"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Would love to see ability to collabarate with others, I am on the paid plan and it is outstanding."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"amzing app. it must be show in top"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"cool app for the note 9. love being able to write notes and drawings associated with the notes and never run out of space."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a South African grade 12 Math teacher using Squid (with the Premium Toolpack) on a daily basis to cast my lessons to a data projector. This way I can show my learners exactly how to do their problems step-by-step. It is just the best whiteboard casting app I've tried! I started out on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10, using only my finger, but I now use a Galaxy Tab S4. What a great experience writing with stylus and erasing with my finger! Thank you for the greatest teaching app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"everything is so great except i wish they made reading pdfs easier. a continuous vertical scroll feature would be so appreciated"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for a Chromebook with a stylus. Opens and lets you edit pdf (and save) with the stylus. Excellent palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! Gives me freedom of the pen on my smartphone! But why the name change"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"keeps me organized and detailed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hot app guys! 🔥"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great! I hope it had more drawing tools!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"now have a note 9 and stylus is great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Keeps deleting my notes. After writing and starting a new page to continue with my notes, whatever was on my first page got deleted."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app to complement the Samsung Galaxy Note9's extensive abilities, and it is excellent in its execution. It also works well with my Samsung Chromebook Pro, with little latency. There's so many options that most anyone will find it useful with an sizeable amount of templates and tools. I think it's completely worth the $10 /yr or $1 /mo charge to fully unlock everything. In fact, I think it's a steal!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be five stars if I could autobackup to OneDrive or Google"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good app👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. It does everything I need for my classes. The only thing I don't like is that you can't make sub-folders in your notebooks. I have a ton of classes that require me to make notes for lectures, homeworks, and labs. I hate having to make new notebooks for all of these for each class because it gets hard to navigate. Please make it easier to organize! Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does what it's supposed to and does it great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very simple and yet very capable app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"That's the perfect app to take notes with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still a great app. I use it regularly for notes and reading pdfs. It is one of the few apps I have never considered removing from my Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app with a of functions. You can erase with finger tip. That's very handy. It's the best among all available handwriting apps. Highly recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Update to Material Design 2.0 Please!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"cannot install the premium version after purchasing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The funniest thing is that the title bar of a note is at the bottom of each note. So inconvenient! The Header is at the Footer level! Lol!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the app it's good for taking notes. I use it for PowerPoint lectures. Easy to download has a writing tool and highlighter. Things I wish it had: 1. the ability to record lectures. 2. a more pigmented highlighter the color looks wispy and faint. but it does the job and I'm happy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only complaint is you can only see the notes you created on that device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for writings and planning"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it's good for note taking but i really want more pen style and maybe add more color by color code."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using squid for my classes for the last two weeks and I'm in love. it really makes the process of going paperless to a degree so easy. I do, however, wish that squid had some aspects of other note taking apps like making default ""favorite pens/highlighters"" and the automatic straight line feature so when I'm trying to make boxes or whatever, the app fixes my wobbly lines itself. Small things, really. But, I love the app regardless!!!!!! Highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great at all the additional features it offers, but lacks basic features like rotating pages and clicking hyperlinks. Unless I'm just not understanding how to do it. In that case maybe it could be more clear. Overall great app though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"nothing is there in basic version everything it claimes is in paid version worst app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! I would love it even more if I could change the line color."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Paid for the premium version (cost of two Starbucks trips) and now I can mark pdf student assignments just like on a paper copy using the Google pixel pen and send a PDF as feedback. Very happy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"First off: I am using this app on chromebook (HP chromebook x2), have the pro version, and bought it to take notes in class for college. App works great. Isn't the best for editing pdfs, but works great for taking notes in class (what I bought it for) Pro Tip: If you want to take notes using this and a capacitive stylus/palm rejection: Set your Desired Page size, and lock zoom. Otherwise its gonna go crazy when you lay your hand down. Only 4 stars because writing can be a bit glichy i.e. you will write about a sentance and nothing will show up then it will al pop up at once from time to time, and occasional other strange happenings, but nothing major."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best stylus note taker I have found on Android or ios"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pay for the full version. I think its worth it. My kids use it even more than I do. Best way to keep them quiet and peaceful out in public."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"subscription? no way"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good application for casual and serious notes making"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the app is really smooth on samsung galaxy note4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"can't change background colour to black. the apply button does nothing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for taking notes, especially in math. Used on a Samsung Chromebook Pro"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply Amazing ... Creative and satisfying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Rocking!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good product. My only issue is that it is too easy to move a page around."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Abdul Aziz all in 1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Wonderful for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best hand writing note. It would be good if app provides 1. Sync 2. Window app and 3. Custom template."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app. it's worth the $1 a month. I use this app several times a day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is working now. 5 Stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"using this for college, I love it! I do wish you can swipe through the pages of the notebook. but it's done so well! Thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the better note apps currently available that gives lots of paper background options for better organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best hand writing app for notes on Android. Wish it had better support for typing so I didnt have to use two apps though. Also having a subcategory to the notebooks would be lovely."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. With this, I no longer need to print something off, sign it, then scan it again. I can scan a document on my phone, convert to pdf, sign on my computer and I'm good to go. This is better than other apps that I have paid money for. Update 1/10/19: The more I use this, the more I love it. This is the Android version of Adobe Pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazingly convenient to sync with Dropbox and export pdfs there. Really responsive to strokes. Minimalistic but offer everything you need if you intend to replace your notebook with your tablet-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"NOT A FREE APP!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app does NEARLY everything I need. If I need to take handwritten ONLY notes it's amazing, but if I want to do a mix of handwritten and typed notes it's a mess and basically unusable. If I click with a touchpad I don't want to draw, I want to insert a text box. If this was an option this application would basically be perfect. Only thing after that is to support more formatting and keyboard shortcuts for said formatting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a wonderful note taking app. My only issue with it is that it doesnt sync across multiple devices. You can back up your notes, but if you restore them on another device, and the notes on that device are replaced with the notes from the restore. If this gets fixed, it would be perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it's a really great app. actually better thsn samsung default!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great tool, especially if you have a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"great tool but really, really needs a text search capability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"a really good app similar to notability. i have simple problems i wish that you can fix. this app has a touch specific for the s pen and a touch specific for the fingers with different functions that i can decide for each. i was hoping you can add the ability to navigate using your finger like when i zome in i want to use my finger to move in the page. it appears i have to do it with two fingers which is annoying. also it would be great if you placed the eraser and pen separately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I also have the paid version and I love using it for school, but it kind of lags when when I lay my hand on the screen. I'll need the special gloves for writing. I don't like that it doesn't have any online storage and forces you to backup everything on your own. Going through a pdf is also difficult if you need to switch from page to page quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app, the PDF markup is excellent. the pen performance is nice and smooth and lag free. The big missing thing is lack of sync."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nicely layed out with many features and options to edit and review documents...best of the type"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On a Pixel Slate, this is a great app.  There are just a couple of things that are almost deal breakers for me.  I'm sure most of it is user-error, but I cannot get the palm rejection to work for the life of me.  As I draw with the stylus, it's constantly trying to multi-task, zoom or other things. I wish there was a quick and easy way to turn on palm rejection.  I also wish there were more pen types like in INKredible.   The other big missing feature is the ability to back up to Google Drive as a cloud option.  That seems pretty reasonable since, as I'm on an Android device I will clearly have a Google Drive account.  Having used both iOS and Android tablets, I think this is the best one on Android, but I still feel like GoodNotes on iOS is the best, overall experience and has some great features Squid should take a look at..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"i think that if there is a folder or directory feature, it will be good. thx."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"App is great for marking up pdfs. It is a little difficult to write words on and when scrolling you have to use two fingers or you make marks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works Great! As an adjuster this app has allowed me to go paperless. No more printing out estimates. I just download PDF's, mark up as needed and save. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Working great so far with my LG Stylo 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"back up options not available with Google or outlook"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Want to use my finger to swipe to change a page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"loved the app. many useful tools even in non-premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved it. But I'm unhappy with its one feature( synch ur data to the google drive) that is only for premium membership."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it's really good.What would be better is if there was a rotation feature for tools and pics so I could scrapbook better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best stylus compatible notes app I've ever tried for Chrome OS."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing I don't like at all is the pricing model. I like that some feature can be bought outright, and I don't mind paying. But having to pay a subscription for cloud backup is a bit much. If you want $5 fine, like like I paid a flat fee for PDF inport. While it works great on the Chromebook Plus it isn't so good on the pixelbook with the pixel pen. it is occasionally laggy and really annoying. Obviously this is a software problem and I'm sure it will get fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since getting my note I have been looking for the best writing app for notes and doing homework. This is awesome with the paid feature of .pdf import. I have tried about a dozen apps and prefer Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfect for my Google Pixelbook and pen. Integrates with Dropbox seamlessly. Very pleased with it so far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is really one of the best note taking apps I've ever used. However, it would be fantastic if we could copy or cut parts or portions of one file or document and paste it on another file/document. similarly, if we could move and insert pages from one document to another. Also consider layering for those who do tech work or use this app for sketching/drawing and other art works. Thanks"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add double page viewing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have the paid version and I love 90% of everything on the app. I love the paper layouts, and changing size of paper, the color selection. I only wish there was 1) more pen types and 2) a way to erase by not just written lines, but my area. otherwise love it and would continue to pay a dollar a month."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm really enjoying this app so far but when I start writing towards the right edge in portrait, there's major latency with where I'm writing and where the words actually appear"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it everyday. Clean interface and recognition. Please, please make it possible to save docs to external local drives and be able to save more than one file at a time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fab tool. Couldn't do with out it now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"brilliant app.life revolving around it currently.preparing all my civil services notes upon squid.only suggestions though: 1.could .mp3 or.mp4 files be added to a page.would be cool to have that level of interactiveness in class notes. 2.the 'take picture ' feature could do with a 'magic scanner ' sort of brightening option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Would be better if there were more options for exporting different levels of image quality, to help manage pdf size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great handwriting app. I use it quite often recently. It would be great if the app have ""create folder"" function so that I can organize my note in different folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"trial versions do not allow for use of the platform without purchasing first."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The way it feels to write in it's quite nice. Also, the performance is good despite the two years old tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, I use it on my pixelbook and other than some issues I have with the pixelbook pen and hardware, Squid does work great. I'd really like to be able to work cross platform tho and to back up my files in the cloud, so like many people I'm really looking forward to that! ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app. only that it should be totally free, and should continue not having ads at all.😊👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"categorization of documents and handwritings is not good, sth like microsoft onenote would be better, but its great in any other field 👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it will be good idea to add different type of line ( for example, solide, dashed, dot and so forth)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Does not try to be too much. Extremely intuitive, enough to be used as my daily note/rough sketch app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best! No doubt that it's editor's choice 😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great note app for my chromebook. love the ability to mark up pdf documents and images. Love the ability to mark up computer generated forms like it was paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app takes time to adapt but quite versatile."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best writing app among samsung notes, one note (free android version) simply because I can set page size and organize my notes well.   UPDATE: After using this app for almost 2 years now, I must say that this is still my app of choice for taking notes in school. Nice colors, for smooth writing and prints fantastically. The biggest problem with other apps is their inability to provide a straightforward way to get notes into PDF properly for printing purposes. Squid is the way to go for taking notes in school, writing assignments and printing.  Only thing I would change in this app is a way to save my notes to the SD card. After almost 2 years, I am running out of space on the pre-installed storage. Also, the lack of a way to export an entire notebook means that I have to manually export each note as PDF to copy that notebook to my long-term storage. That is very tedious but looks like I have no other way to save my notes and free-up space.  My advice for newbies is to export your notes daily or weekly and at the end of a semester delete the notebook to save space. You will thank me later.  Thank the developers for a very useful note-taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It just works. I haven't had any issues and the monthly price is minimal for loads of features. I've been using it to sign PDF documents with a handwritten signature on my Note 9. Saves a ton of time and cost on printing contracts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"hi team, one small request, could you also introduce the feature of adding folders and create notebook inside folders.. folders inside folders which would help segregating class notes the better way...... means feature similar to what lecture notes app has....initially I have used lecture notes app... that was good as well.......but found squidnotes far better than any other note taking app....only feature, that we expect to adding folders within folder, notebook within folder etc...also annotating PDF works great, but if it still retains the contents page book mark it would be excellent.. Current status of my issue : hi team, thanks for adding palm rejection for my phone model... yesterday I got a new option in squidnotes... it prompted whether I use active pen... I said yes.. then palm rejection worked.. I also see options for input which says finger or active pen.... thanks a lot team for introducing this feature.... this is what I thought was one of the drawback previously... now the squidnotes application is excellent with this feature..... 5 stars for this app... even if there is 5 more stars, I would like to give.. I feel squidnotes truely values it's premium paid customers... My previous question: Is there any way to enable palm rejection in squidnotes... I use infinix note 5 stylus which had active pen with pressure sensitivity.. but palm rejection is not happening in squidnotes..any suggestions ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This was amazing. I turned my instructor's PowerPoints into PDFs and then took class notes right on the slides with my tablet. Absolutely the best for relating my notes to the relevant class material. No, more paper notebooks for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The is an awesome app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please, add an option to add voice memos and web links to notes. Would be very usefull during lectures to leave some voice memos for myself."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A4 Page option would be nice, no proportion"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I setup the page so it is Letter size, but when I type, it just puts the text out of bounds. Why doesn't it send text to the next line on the page or cut off my typing so I know to start at the next line? I also really dislike typing in that little box... It's so awkward and nearly impossible to edit as you're typing. It's a hassle to actually go back and edit text. Just not user friendly at all. NOTE: BEWARE OF THESE SCAMMERS!!!! I changed my rating to 1 star after their response to a big problem. The text feature is incompatible with their page setups, as well as on the letter, legal, etc. page sizing options. All of your text that you entered in the text box will appear on one line.There's nothing you can do about it. It's ridiculous though. You can't read the text either because it will tell you it's ""out of bounds"" and this is after you just spent all that time entering your notes. Now your notes and time are gone. If they aren't worried about their text feature working, why is it in the description or part of the app at all? They're just advertising features that they know it doesn't have? Oh well, guess your focus is on the buck you got from me, right? Now we really know your ""#1 Priority""! Glad I didn't pay for a year. What a scam! BEWARE OF THESE PEOPLE AND THIS APP!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: Export function can more customize, like export from page 2 to 4, that's better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm using this on a Pixel Slate, and it's a little buggy. There is an occasional lag when writing. There is also some issue with the way my hand writting is rendered on the screen. It makes my handwriting look shaky. I turned off the pressure sensitivity and it helped some. There are also some issues with palm rejection. laying my palm on the screen jiggles the page around making it difficult to write. This app works great on my Note 8. It's probably just not optimized for the Pixel Slate yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would prefer buy outright instead of subcription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Handy and simple note organization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app , could use more option for coloring shapes and tools like ruller and compas for arches. But simple to use app and does the job pretty well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for capturing my handwriting! I use it on a Chromebook Pro, and it's even smoother than writing on paper. I'm able to easily organize my notes into notebooks, add pages to my notes, and even change whether I'm writing with notebook paper lines, graph paper, or plane white. And did I mention you can change the colors and thickness of the ink? Now, I'm not a fan of subscribing to things - the freemium version of Squid will do almost everything you need for notetaking, and I'm very happy with it. I did some in-app purchases for typing on the screen and adding shapes, and those have been worthwhile and affordable. --- Update: I now also have the app on my phone, and alas there is no way to sync the notes from my phone and my Chromebook. However, both my phone and Chromebook automatically backup my notes to Dropbox every day as PDF's, and it's easy to export the really important notes to specific folders in my Google Drive (and other online platforms) as needed. Plus you can't beat the control for line thickness, color, and page background. Granted, you get even better backgrounds (including daily planner) if you sign up for premium, and I can't afford that. But with a few in-app purchases you can get PDF and JPG import, which will them provide any background you could possibly want. I actually use the app to take photos and then draw sketches over the photos. Once the sketch is done, I copy the lines over to a plain white background, and voila - a nice cartoon image. Do if you're looking for a versatile and dependable notes app with automatic backup, I think this may be your best bet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Some small improvements would make this perfect. But it is still very good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very nice. Some simple thing to add. Triangles in shapes. Create our own library of shapes. Also, is it ponible to have handwriting recognition inbuilt. To add-it does not have a rotate or flip function, & no snap to function. A rotate function is absolutely neccessary to make it usable. To add, it needs group function as well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best note-taking apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The reason I own a tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Moving the text once placed would be awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app. One of the most useful app for taking notes. Just one fault: it doesn't have multi-devices sync, not even with the Premium pack"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love Squid. 😍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good.. I can even do my calculus in this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"a good app is this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I thought this was a good program with smooth writing, so I bought it to be able to import pdf's and write on them. I paid the $10 for a yearly subscription.   Yes, it allows you to write on the pdf's, but the refresh is horrible, I imported a 10 page pdf, and the tablet slowly redraws each page when I move between them. Should not have half the screen disappear. No, it's not the tablet. I use One Note by Microsoft, and I have none of these issues. Honestly not worth it.   I would recommend One Note, which is free and writes smoothly (plus you have access to all your notes on the web for free), or Xodo, which lets you highlight pdf's (I imported a 2000 page document, no issues scrolling entire document), also can add text, draw, and more. Going back to that, should have never left. Figured a paid app would be better than a free one, I was wrong. Really would like a refund."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app turned out better than I expected. Good set of features and nice user interface. Also very stable; it has never crashed in several months. The import PDF is amazing as I can import a scanned document and mark it up. I use this for work and teaching. I got the subscription. Good value."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app have found so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is by far the best app for taking notes! Besides the selection of basic tools like pens and highlighters, there is a wide selection of paper backgrounds to choose from, even without the pro version! Pro isn't needed if you are only interested in using various grid or lined paper, but includes a wide selection of math and engineering type or musical note backgrounds. Whats preventing 5 stars? You can't turn the paper nor is there a stylus mode where you can rest your hand on like in other apps. Besides that out of all the apps I've tried, it is the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the go-to app for note taking on a chrome os device. Works really well with HP Chromebook x2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for drawing, pdf viewing with editing.... Simply awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best stylus note taking app on Android. Use every day on ward."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm sure part of this has to do with the device involved, but the handwriting on this with a Pixel Slate is phenomenal. Hands down the closest I've experienced to writing on paper even when compared to high end drawing tablets. I had to knock a star off due to not being able to switch pages easily in a PDF, but if you have a Slate, this app is a must."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth the money, great app on chromebook with stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's pretty dope"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I liked it........"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very Useful App Recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good app, I bought the subscription because of how good it was and how much it helped me. Lots of features. It replaced ONE NOTE for me. It's great as it is but if the developers for some reason see this and want to improve it a little, then I do have a few tiny nit pics. 1st. The selection too is nice but it only selects in a square. On one note you can select in any with weird shake you want. This makes it easier to omit things that would normally be in the square. Add that as an additional feature, just like the eraser. I love what you did with it. On one note, you only had the stroke erase. Which make 0 made it hard to erase little bits. I would love to be able to square select and free select. Both are useful 2nd. Additional folders. One note didn't have this and to my knowledge this doesn't really either. Just like one sub folder I think. 3rd. PDF export view. This feature would capture the screen or maybe a selection and export a PDF. Would be very nice. I do a lot of math on this and I would like to export my one equation to ask a teacher. Currently I have to copy, open a new page, paste and then export. I do not expect these to ever come to be real but if they do, Great! I have a 4 star because it's a great app. Put one of these features in and I'll meet and it a 5. But I don't that my one additional star means anything to anyone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've rewritten this review several times now before realizing that google play ui is poorly set up in tablets (the reason for my losing my review writing progress several times) so now I'm writing it elsewhere and pasting it in later. Anyway, I've been compiling a list of features I want from Squid, in a Squid note (for irony or something). But for this review, I'd like to suggest that the devs of Squid try downloading INKredible, the leading competitor for handwritten notes (on Android at least; idk for iOS). There are a lot of similarities and differences, and pros and cons for each, but ultimately I chose to keep Squid. It wasn't an easy choice though, and I hope for Squid to improve to a point where it /would/ be an easy choice. That is, for Squid to implement all the ""pros"" without adding any of the ""cons"" of its competitor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking abilities. Works very well with my Samsung Note pro 12.2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A couple of usability tweaks away from great I like Squid's 'write on PDF' capabilities, but feel that the page turn function is really lacking for reading PDFs. Reopening a written on PDF in a more 'read-friendly' app lacks the edits I've made, so this is important."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please make the feature of marking pdf in full screen mode and palm rejection feature. Otherwise everything is awesome about this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great app! You can QUICKLY prepare & edit in a freely way almost all your docs. I would say, it's a small magic tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app paired with an s-pen. I take notes for all of my classes and I've saved a ton of paper by importing PDFs and note taking right on the device!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With galaxy note 8, it is awesome. Squid has a intuitive tool. I use it in lecture. It is very helpful and approtiate fee."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Note-taking app I was looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very solid note taking app, love the different kinds of paper. Wishing there were some shapes that we're free to use (boxes, lines/arrows, circle)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Responsive a need works great so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would be nice with auto PDF export to google drive + selective OCR / text recognition. Excellent app though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"too expensive, subscription based for a simple note taking app, developer must be crazy or greedy, look elsewhere"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I do like the app, but I can't get premium features as I still DONT DO subscriptions (which implies an ongoing service) for apps like this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app I've found for handwritten notes on my Tab S4 & Note 9. Better custom templates would be nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"You can not scroll through the pdf easily"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for use with a stylus and tablet... great almost real writing and doodling experience..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good work, thank you :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"App works very well, except for portability. Positively the app does almost everything I want it to do and works as advertised. Negatively, the integration with google drive is poor which means what I do in Squid stays on one device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Just what I wanted for taking notes even on PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, I use it everyday. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is a reliable notetaking app. I just hope you can easily use your keyboard and also be able to type than just write the whole time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On high resolution screens such as on the tab S3, the vectoring is visible and there is a slight delay. Not as good as Samsung notes app in that regard. Also, the text tool is really limited and lacking. I wish the text tool was more integral so you could also switch to writing out some text that is integrated into the document instead of just ""creating"" a graphics of the text. Real imbedded text within the document that you can have more control over would be very welcomed. This app could then be a huge competiton to apps like OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very focused and to the point, no distractions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Difficult to use, resourceless. Either ypu pay or it doesn't have many options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best notetaking app on my Galaxy note 9."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I can't seem to figure out how to connect my Google Drive with this app. I don't use Dropbox or Box and would like to use Google Drive instead. I saw somewhere, where I could do just that, but I can't figure out how."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is probably my most used app on my pixelbook. I love love love taking notes, doodling, and keeping track of the lists that I usually write on paper and then forget somewhere. This is really making me consider trying to go paperless in the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love Love this app! Have bought tablets for all my staff and running this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"lag on chrome os after update on pixelbook very dissapointing i pay monthly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, but there's still much room for improvement :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A good app, no regret subscribing to it. However will be even better if developer can provide option to disable the finger eraser while retaining the eraser function at the blunt tip of the M Pen (huawei mate 20x). As of right now, disable the finger eraser will also disable the eraser on my pen. Its quite annoying in the sense that accidentally trying to scroll with one finger will erase what i scribbled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Plz keep a option of screen record..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and adapt to. However capabilities could be more, for example a zoom out box to inrease noting space for small parts of a text would give much more possibility for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exceeded my expectations. I wish there was an option to directly sync pdf files from a folder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best for hands notes, but wish pdf functions were better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply useful apps for taking a note with stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add the ability to change page background color from white to other shades. (the current templates vary in line patterns but not line/background color)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. The performance with Samsung's S-pen is just perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Disappointed. The app doesn't let you organise your notebooks into sub-notebooks or even rearrange the order in which your notebooks are displayed manually. With that inconvenience, you'd think they would at least have the option to search through your notes using key words (I am not talking about handwriting recognition like in Samsung Notes here - just a simple header search) - but they don't. All that results in a very messy experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Acts like notability for android. So helpful for my studies. I especially like how simple yet complex it is. And premium is just a dollar a month which is such a steal for everything that's included. So happy that I found this app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good stuff!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Need to pay more for different features i.e import pdf, and paper templates. It's not one time payment that includes all additional features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App is the best drawing app that I have used, and works great with chromebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for shopping lists and reminder notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Had to hard reset my device so I made a backup (because squid for some reason keeps it's documents in the app and not in the device itself which would have prevented this whole debacle). Of course the backup got corrupted and now I'm stuck with an ""invalid backup file"" and I've lost a lot of work. I still appreciate that it supports PDF import so it'll stay installed for that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since the update my ability to load pdf files from a SD card in my chromebook is gone! I have it set up so that all my downloads go to my card so if something happens to my laptop I don't lose all my files. Otherwise this app is awesome! Please bring back the ability to load from somewhere other than the downloads section!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than evernote for the price"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Useful app, but it has issues backing up notes and I lost months of notes. Active stylus works better than other apps like Google Keep. It's nice to annotate PDFs but tedious to read them! :-/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My notebook app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, use daily for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I still dont know how much Premium cost"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a terrific tool, but a few basic features are needed: rotate graphics, background fade, and custom pen colour."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I review my evaluation because I have been using the payed version for almost 1 year now, and haven't got any update... Nothing new or improved in 1 year??? Come on devs... (Handwriting recognition for example...)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"its really good for people in college and just for taking notes i just hope that very soon they will have an update for the writing portion where when drawing or taking notes the there can be a recording button to show somewhat a step by step review"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful and usually allows me to make notes and sketches with fingertips."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"O aplicativo é maravilhoso, uso todos os dias para estudar inglês e quando iniciar a faculdade em Fevereiro irei usar mais ainda... Peço que coloquem a opção de comprar o aplicativo com todas as funções por um preço acessível e justo... Sem a necessidade de mensalidade... Muito obrigada!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best note taking app out there. It's barebones, but it WORKS. the low-latency ink is a game changer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for all my admin stuff and for all my life stuff like Day of the Dead trip to Mexico. Peace."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for working on pdf files and when using the Samsung pen great for taking notes and highlighting sections. Didn't really appreciate how good it is until I started using it regularly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great on my Lenovo 300e chromebook! I regulary use it to take notes and use as scratch paper. The only problem is that the toolbar doesn't expand. If I want to switch between the pen and eraser or any other toolr it takes 3 clicks (open tool bar, select eraser, close toolbar)! Then 3 more steps to get back to the pen. I will still use the app but I really hope you can fix this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good support in Chromebook, but why cannot back up to Google Drive? I hope Google Drive Supported. Thanks for developing such a good application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The ability to annotate pdf documents is really useful. I like the large range of note paper and natural feel of the writing action. The experience is as close to a real writing experience as I've ever have with an app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for taking notes, and upgrading it is so economical and beneficial for me, since I am a university student. Loving it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very convenient"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless without paid subsription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an incredibly useful app for my Chromebook. Handwriting my notes has never been so satisfying--and, I can still doodle on my pages (this app is a very good double for a drawing one as well!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for all my notes and homework, support for spending makes this app the best in the play store"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its great! Works well for my needs as a teacher taking electronic notes to share with my students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect app for taking notes during class, but please add Google Drive backup for premium!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is perfect for taking notes by hand on my pixelbook, I love this app and use it in every class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lots of templates to choose from, sure to find the right one for you. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app functions like a dream as I take notes using my galaxy tab A. It's honestly just as good as writing on paper with the addes bonus of having infinite space per page and the ability to select around parts of my handwritten notes that I want to move around. I'm seriously thinking of getting a year of premium account but I need to know if this will give me a multiple device sync? Also, do you have a desktop or web bases app that will allow me to access my notes when I'm on my laptop/desktop? On my free version, I know there's an option to back up locally or export to my drive as pdf/jpg/etc. But I was thinking more along the lines of Google Keep's sync style."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Did what I needed it to do! No app shutdowns, very easy to use, and easily share and upload edited files to utilise on other devices as needed!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app for taking notes on pdfs. The app does work well for palm rejection and writing is smooth. However, I would like to have seen two improvements. One, a PDF search function so that I can search for typed keywords. The second improvement would be to separate the pen and highlighter. I take a lot of notes on pdfs a lot and I am constantly switching back and forth. Why can't the three major stylus functions be on the primary menu (pen, highlighter, & eraser)?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall functional. It would be useful if the developer would consider introducing note ""tags"" and ""Google Drive"" storage."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app has become very important to my work. being able to import pdfs and write on them has been a godsend! thank you so much for making this app! I just wish there was a faster way to switch between documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app is fantastic, but it doesn't support backup to Google Drive which I think is a MAJOR downfall. Otherwise it would be a 5 star app. *Sidenote* S-Pen support is fantastic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"it would be good if it has more data to a note, such as the date that note was writen, and organizing notes!!! put things in folders!!!!!! right now this apps works perfectly but as soon as i get enough notes, I will have to orgainze the notes!!!!! Please add a organize version!! and a google account backup :D then this app would be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great way to reduce paper usage"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's annoying not being able to rotate pages. No copy of pasting when docs are imported and tools are limited compared to a free desk doodling app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Latest version has significant lag when using a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this to make quick forms for customers to fill in. It makes documenting site visits very easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a little less functional than I'd like it to be, but for free it comes with enough to draw in different colors and thicknesses and embed images. The strokes with the Pixel Pen are pressure sensitive to increase and decrease the thickness too. You have to pay a couple bucks for the rest of the templates, but it's not a bad price for an app. You can increase page size and change the dimensions to that of different paper standards, add lines or grids, and export to pdf, jpeg, or png. You can also add multiple pages to a single note and organize notes into different notebooks. Works with just a finger too! Lastly, (and I like this feature a lot), you can import pdfs. Great for doing homework right on the assignment. Feature request: add layers for additional drawing tools. I use this app mostly for dungeons and dragons mapping (mirrorring screen with a Chromecast), and having layers would make it infinitely easier to handle fogs of war and the like."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take college level notes. It is the best android note taking app I have discovered so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I uninstalled it the very second I saw you had to buy the premium version just to add text. You have to pay money... to write decent text... in a notebook app. Frankly it's insulting when there are dozens of other options. Go elsewhere people."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing notes and drawing. Pixelbook Pen support works great. Text input tool could definitely be improved."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls add Calligraphy pen. That can prove very beneficial...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for two years. Use it for teaching my classes. Has some issues initially, emailed the developer and they were fixed quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only thing keeping this rating from a 5 star is often times on my Pixelbook, when I zoom the screen will go black and take a second before coming back up. I have to close the app and reopen when this happens because the pen will then have significant lag"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for notetaking. By reducing the input lag, they have really made it a smooth writing experience where you can almost feel like you are writing on paper. The tools are simple and easy to use, can edit and write on pdf and pictures. Really versatile, and useful. Definitely my favorite note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lifesaver"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the greatest note taking app ive used, the only thing i wish that they added was the ability to search for specific note titles and the ability to change the color of some notes, for example if i wanted to make some green so i could find them faster instead of having all of them looking the same, blue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool. Useful for taking and organising your notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app everyday, for almost all the things i need to write down. Beyond my expectations."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. Would like to see a more robust tool menu to make transition between erase, select and write quicker. Would also like to be able to scroll with 1 finger instead of erasing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use this for classes and work. It's pretty great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Poor interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a nice app with a lot of features that include letting the user take pics and add PDFs. I would give 5 start if I could add folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with the pixel book"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like writing on paper, but better..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The deal breaker is no zoom pad. The key point of zoom pad is that it is a good navigation tool. For example, if I zoomed in and want to change to the next line, it is so hard to find it especially this app has issues when moving the paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If a few more things were added (like being able to: label notes & search based on those labels, duplicate notes & notebooks, sync cross-platform/cross-device, use additional writing tools) this app would be an absolutely perfect one-stop-shop for note taking. As it stands I'm having to use other apps to make up where this app lacks. That said, the inking experience is without a doubt second to none and is the reason I love and continue to use Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There are a lot of times I feel like the app is not fluid ot what I need it for such as easy jpeg or pdf writing. It's possible that the premium features have this unlocked but so possibly a trial version maybe? Great App though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I found it a bit deceiving. It said I could use it to Mark up PDFs but it didn't say only in the upgraded version. I deleted it right away."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for college."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app out there right now IMO."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I never write app reviews, but I love Squid. I actually bought a reMarkable recently (a dedicated note-taking device), and having used Squid I just couldn't get into it... Works great on a pixelbook, super low latency pen integration. Love the erase w/ finger feature. Add a search feature based on handwriting recognition (I don't need to export to text, I just want to be able to search my notes), and it'd be perfect for me. Would also be great if the pinned orientation feature worked better in tablet mode on ChromeOS - I keep accidentally hitting buttons in the dock/tray (but this is more a fault of ChromeOS than Squid, IMO)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would give 5 stars if there was the option to import PDFs but with a blank page below/beside each page of the PDF. Or perhaps being able to set the page size as infinite when on a an imported PDF (so there's space to write about the imported PDF). I use this app for lecture notes, so I import the lecture slides into the app, but then there isn't any room to take notes on each page!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this app on the TabS4 with a stylist and I absoulutly love the hand written note taking capabilities. The app has a great selection of paper back ground to choose from and inserting pages is a snap. Best app on my tablet!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great but I wish it had google drive sync, magnifying writing and a non subscription way to get the full version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Lost all my data. No response from support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have to mark up PDFs this is a must have app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app when using stylus tool to write on pdf powerpoint slides for my college classes. this is fantastic, and i dont have to print each lecture for notes. I just use Squid!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for notetaking, general writing. I use it extensively on my galaxy tab for character sheets. Being able to manipulate and interact with what you've written in previous sessions is invaluable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs o365 onedrive support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Editor's choice, seriously ??? The very first time I started using the app, I wanted to open a pdf to take notes on it, and guess what ? It says you need to upgrade to take notes on a pdf !!! An upgrade offer without even using the app. Great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful for my crazy school work and life notes, beautifully and simply designed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for student note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please improve the part of page scrolling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app. I wish they'd add more selection options in future"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've started to use it in a Samsung tab s4 at work to replace for taking notes. The handwriting is decent still needs some work in the portrait mode. Need to deepen in special features capabilities of squid. So far is usable. One advice needs from the user to reorganize your way of taking notes as if you were using a couple of handbooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fab!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I try to draw a curve line with my bamboo tip but no matter how I do it, it's wriggly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very hamdy for my note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Essential. Not perfect, but it's the closest one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent digital note-taking app. I use it often and it has never let me down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good app for note taking and pdf markup"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for studying. I was struggling with reading my books but now i can just download them into squid and read them. It also allows you to mark, highlight and mark on the key points. Thnx"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's good but most of the features are blocked, so the experience is disappointing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"False advertising and overall ridiculous. Have to pay to import PDFs. Bait and switch"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I could use rotation of drawings, other than that, perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"so far i like it... i can only wish that when i write... it doesnt trigger other things outside such as other apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used this program for over a year and have found it very useful. I recently upgraded to the Premium version because I had become so comfortable with it that I found I needed the extra features. As a math teacher, I find it is the best tool for being able to move around the room and keep track of my students as I teach the class. Being able to save and review my work from the ""whiteboard"" is very useful for reviewing for tests."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This works really well with my Lenovo yoga book, and is great for taking notes by digitally writing directly onto a PDF. The scrolling can be a bit annoying and imprecise, hence the lack star review. Nevertheless, it's a really handy app and my go to for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I am changing my review score. I really wish you guys implement some feature for changing pages that make it a lot easier. Like why not changing pages like on kindle or kobo? Or maybe just the fact that you drag the page to the left you could bring the next page. It is frustrating that you need to click on an arrow to change a page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It gave all these features in the description prior to install. Beware... Roughly 2 of the 10 I liked were available. Was hit with a subscription fee just to use a highlighter. A highlighter? Really? No thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great for making lecture notes. Its made my 3rd year so much easier! I wish I had had it from the start of my degree! Cannot recommend it enough"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Everything that needs payment in this app is for free in the app called xodo docs. We will not pay for importing a pdf !!!! We are android users and not apple sheep consumers!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app BY FAR!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"If you wanna try the PDF tool you must buy the subscription, just to discover that it is very bad: not fluent at all and you can only see 1 page. If you have a note 8 or 9 the default ""Write on PDF"" is a lot better than this app. So don't buy it if you need this feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Decent note taking app. No discernable lag on normal handwriting but on longer strokes it does lag quite badly. Dropbox integration. Monthly subscription - but I question the value of this as squid don't actually offer direct cloudsync or device sync. One thing I wish they would fix NOW is highlighter function - this is just an adjustable opacity brush, it still overlays the text which doesn't serve to highlight, only cover the text. Should be layered under the text to make it pop. This is considered a premium feature and should be fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for drawing explanation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notebook app ever, particularly for s-pen, absolutely perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the lined paper design. This is the most satisfactory note app I've tried in regards to the feel. I hope to see more widget options in the future"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's simple and awesome. One thing missing is backup to Google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome on note 5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Tried a couple of note apps since getting my Chromebook Pro and Squid came highly recommended. The problem with Squid for me is that its text option (which you can use to type with your keyboard) has this outlined text that can't be changed to just a simple solid font. I don't understand why they made it that way. Another issue is that there are no options to help improve your handwriting through different pen types and strokes. Anyway, I prefer InKredible for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have had this for years but bought a S3 with the S Pen and takes it to a whole new level. It is like having a huge piece of paper with a lot of colored pens to take notes. Outstanding"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's 2018. This app is useless without multidevice sync and options for backing up to OneDrive or at least Google Drive. I hoped upgrading to pro would give me these options, but it was a waste of $10. If you don't mind losing your notes, the handwriting experience is otherwise nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great S pen writing program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this app for the sole purpose of marking PDFs as described on the title. Turns out it's a paid function. Uninstalling not 5 minutes after installing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wanted a straightforward note app and this is perfect. Simple to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this every day"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, was looking for Scribble equivalent on Android tablet and this more than met expectations. Thank you, Squid team!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"You have to pay to use a HIGHLITER"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Reliable notetaking and drawing notes app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Naaiiisss"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic program. Everything I wanted it to do and more. Totally worth the money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Does what I need it to. Great for taking notes in real time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very useful app to quickly jot down notes in meetings. I use it on Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and the stylus makes it even more easy keep up with the pace of speaker."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful, handy. Better with a pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Comfort tools"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really enjoy this app for notetaking, but it has a tendency to crash way more than personally acceptable. Still my go-to but really inconvenient when you're in the middle of a university lecture and you have to restart your entire laptop in order to continue taking notes :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such an amazing companion app for the Samsung note. Very powerful and responsive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"insert pdf must premium? i dont think so"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Okay, I am VERY thorough. I like to have the best apps for school and work. I spent SO MUCH time comparing apps and THIS... THIS IS THE ONE I LOVE. It works the best on my 2-in-1 chromebook with an emr pen.  The only option I wish there was, is a rectangle magnifier which gives you the ability to write on a part of the page but you write from the bottom of the screen (I don't know how to explain it very well, I am sorry). I really hope it's a feature I will see in the future as it would mean you spend less time scrolling / sliding and you can write even clearer and condensed notes :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app for managing my notes. Handwriting recognition is top notch, integrates well with s-pen. There is an annoying bug that when you scroll the page the new section doesn't load until you release your finger. Also a useful new feature would be fixed width infinite height pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easily the best note taking app. I use on my Pixelbook with the Pixel pen, and particularly like the PDF annotation ability (a paid feature, but well worth it). This is my go-to app for taking notes at seminars, and I love the ability to snap a picture of an interesting slide, immediately import it, and then add my notes. Just a great app all around - and works fantastically well with the pressure sensitive Pixel pen (and much better than using a stylus with Google Keep)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Literally does not offer one of the headlining features without a fee."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good and helpful for its help or tutorial. But for all features you have to pay more money. Why ammeture users pay for that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty much the best Free handwriting app, and believe me I've tried them all. This is prolly the first time I've thought about buying the an apps full version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"INKredible is a much better & cheaper app check it out guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, easy organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Support rotating image and selected object please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this daily. Best by far! I really really wished it synced to my pc tho."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app for doing my homework and taking notes over teacher provided lecture slides. Definitely worth the dollar per month"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for school. You can organize every class in its own folder. My only gripe is that when you add something to a previous note, it changes the date to when you made the change. Otherwise, it's great for class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I gave it an honest shot. While it is a beautiful app, it lacks the basic staples needed for success. No collaboration, no ability to rearrange notes within a notebook, and most importantly, NO SYNC. This is almost laughable! What powerful note taking app doesn't sync? Doing manual backups and restorations is not only archaic, it is a major liability. How easy is it to lose an entire year of work by accidentally resorting an incorrect backup? Come on guys, this is a no brainer. UPDATE: I dropped from three stars to two stars. I have lost numerous documents because of the lack of syncing options. Also, there has been more than enough time for Squid to update their app to allow automatic syncing. While I understand you can set an automatic cloud update, this is still not helpful because you have to manually restore a backup EVERY SINGLE TIME you use a different device. It is ridiculous."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it is my every day tool in work. i dont use paper anymore. It has 4 shortcuts when push the stylus button. Excellent program"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notetaking app on ChromeOS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app! It's the best for note-taking, especially in school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried multiple apps for making notes / lectures on my tablet, this is by far the best most user friendly app out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably one of, if not the best note taking apps for chromebooks. It's easy to use and there are many different useful tools. Spending the $10 was also an easy choice for me, because the tools that come with it make note taking much easier, and I'm able to replace physical paper notes with notes on this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I just wish it offered hex graph paper for organic chemistry."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for notetaking in class. It's easy to snap a pic of the whiteboard, put it into squid, and take side notes off that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I usenit for teachjng and it works amazing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super useful for saving money on textbooks for classes. I still get to highlight and take notes to my heart's content, but I avoid the costs of traditional college textbooks. Win-win."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"When I want to write the paper always movement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this for school notes and homework. I've used it for the semesters now and I love it. Way better than anything else I've tried. Onenote used to be my go to app. They changed it a while back and made it awful for tablet use. So I went searching for a new notes app. I tried all the big names but when I used squid I instantly fell in love with it. Its simplicity is the key, I think, but you don't have to sacrifice some key features that you need in a note taking app. The only thing I would change would be able to access one drive as a cloud bank up, or really any cloud backup besides the ones they chose for you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of my favorite apps. Functionally essential"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Suit for taking a note in class, solving problem, or writing down your ideas. Work best with stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So flexible and so much fun"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hi there, not sure who to contact. the app recently uninstalled on my computer. i dont know how or why? i am trying to re-download it, but it says it will be loaded soon. are all my files on the app now lost or deleted? is there someone that can look into this or fix this issue. i would hate to see anything deleted. other than that this app is truly amazing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would rather have the tool bars from top and bottom of the screen disappear while editing my pdf files. As these occupy precious screen space on mobile devices. Much of the important screen space is thereby lost. Otherwise I find this application very helpful. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a very well app with just only three flaws ... three big flaws ... first the grid/line color should not be blue! Too much blue and it interfere with my eyes when using black or similar ink colors. Second flaw is the way the stroke rendered on my device (Tab S3). It so bad. Please take a look how Inkredible or even OneNote renders the pen strokes. Third is the pressure sensitivity. It's too sensitive like I always need to put little power everytime I want to write. Yes I know I could disable the pressure feature. Please take a look at Bamboo Paper or OneNote for comparison."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app! I have a Tab S3 and the app works flawlessly with the S Pen and I use it all the time in class to write notes. A few suggestions: add more shapes to the shape tool and add the ability to rotate shapes, other than that I am completely satisfied with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm generally not that organized, and this keeps all my notes in one place. Plus it saved me from having to get more graph paper 👍 I'd definitely recommend the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application is alright I suppose actually to coin a phrase"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this App! I've been looking for something to replace notability since I've moved to Android. This does pretty much everything. The only thing I'd like to see improved is when I do a lot of typing on the letter page setting that it would Carrige Return automaticly to stay on the page. Thanks guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app I've found yet! I've tried at least 5 or 6 others that didn't have as good of interfacing. Plus I can import PDFs so I download my assignments and write straight on them. It saves tons of paper, tons of space, and tons of time. 10/10 would recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yuh"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what is days and does it well. No bugs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like, but want to love. Needs better cloud syncing between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing tool for reviewing and taking notes on PDFs! Extension well worth it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The basics are okay. Making notes at a basic level works good. Importing pdf is good and writing over it is okay for basic work, however, loading the pdf from the drive is a pain because it takes forever to load and there is not a button to sync or force sync when new files are loaded to drive. The pages can be pass as a book but have to go to arrows and/or select from the whole sheets but difficult to see them properly. In general it is okay to do basic work and deal a little bit with finding where each button or task is located at. Just some things to improve and I bet it will be great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for quick handwritten notes and handlettering layout planning."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bought this as a PDF markup tool for $15. Can't get a refund an no trial option. Very poor markup for pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay in order to use your pdf's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a PM in the construction industry and this app helps me mark up drawings on the fly. It's a great tool when you're out in the field! Definitely worth it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is my top app since I take a lot of notes every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Was learning to draw a perfect circle free hand and this app helped a lot in that😂"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love this app !!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple notetaking app. Works great with PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A good app but should be better. Your handwriting is not as nice as other apps. It's rather shaky. Also, you should utilize more space on the toolbar. I mean, it should show more options like Onenote, which present to us 4 pens (with diff strokes and colors), the eraser, the selections, etc. shouldnt be hidden. You may also have an option to hide the toolbar when needed. If possible, please give us more pens like fountain pen, pencil, etc. The option to change paper rule line is more than welcome, because blue is so tedious. Im an subsribed user of you guys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice, but I'd love to be able to rotate objects."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"usefull and great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"pen support on the pixelbook is great, writes much more smoothly than in keep. However, many critical features that could make this the perfect note-taking app for chrome os are missing. For instance, you cannot scroll continuously through pages of pdfs, and you can't have more than one note open at once (for instance, marking up a pdf textbook and taking notes at the same time). The app also does not have access to local files on the computer, although I have read that this is an issue with android apps in chrome os. Squid does not support syncing to other devices or to Google drive. I have also been experiencing some crashing while working on larger notes. Otherwise, out of all the mediocre/broken ways of taking notes and drawing on chrome os that I have tried so far, this is the least mediocre/broken"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is really helpful for annotating PDFs and is a good note taking app. I think it is definitely worth a dollar a month for the expanded features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Convenient, easy to use. Does what i want it to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Only useful if you use with pen like Samsung smart pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"gap between marginnote of ios is big"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is one of the best at detecting handwriting and displaying it accurately on the page. 5 stars With the ability to add AND delete pages in a note, reorganize pages in a note, and have notebooks inside notebooks. Would love to see ability to easily sync notes across devices. Then it would truly be the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"T IV E B M E B E EV P DO F P L S"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful for reading and annotating text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has been the perfect app for me to create my homework solutions and screecasts for my students. I use it in tandem with screencastify to make helpful tutorial videos for my students and they love it. I love that it has a bunch of different background options (like graph paper!) so that I have everything at my disposal whenever I need it :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most useful notetaking app I've tried. Brilliant interface and PDF import function if you pay for the subscription which is worth it. Fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using the Squid app with my new ASUS Chromebook since Christmas 2017, and it has been a wonderful experience. The app is by far the best one I was able to find during my research and testing of others, and I would recommend it to anyone needing to shift from paper-based notes to a digital form."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Need Screenshot for images in pdf document. Need a simple way to pass pages in pdf documents"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry the people that like this but I hate it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easily the most intuitive handwriting app I've used. It also is the fastest performing one by far. It is very smooth even on my 4 year old tablet. The only thing missing is automatic two way syncing, but the app can automatically export PDF's of all of your notes to both Box and Dropbox at set time intervals, as often as every six hours. That is sufficient for most of my needs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great tool for writing on PDFs and images cheap and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does as advertised. Works well and the ability to insert pdf into the notes is a thumbs up for me. However, I wish they could have added backup to Google Drives."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's good, but the subscription feature just to get other important tools you just might need to use is a turnoff for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"looks like a nice app. I would have purchased BUT. I do not do subscriptions!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"there is a few glitches here and there but for the mkst part it works well; I would like to see this app being updated more often sk the latency lag is less likely to happen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it, so good for taking notes during lecture, split screen with power points all day long! please add compatability with googl drive!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, but not all the way there yet. Its hands down the best note taking app on Chrome OS thus far, but still pales in comparison to One Note on a Windows device. I love what the developers are doing though. There needs to be a better implementation of typed text to written text though. For all the bells and whistles One Note has, thats the are where it is far superior to this app. Not having to type something one sentence at a time or convert something to PDF just so I can import it into Squid keeps it second place for now. I hope Google reaches out to Squid and help provide them the resources need to make this an even better app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is actually a great app and I bought the paid version. Pressure sensitivity, easy to change thickness, color, good templates, intuitive. If you have a stylus, it's the note taking app to have. IMO."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a really outstanding note taking app for android, if not the best. Taking notes with an active pen is really easy and practical. The interface is really nice and simple. Also a fair price for premium options which really are usefull. The fact that pdfs are exported without being splitted into a4 format (or any format for that matter) is really nice, something that can't be done in onenote for example. Some functions, however, could be better. It would be nice to import PDF files within a note so that you can annotate the PDF file (instead of importing PDF pages seperately as a new page). Also, it would also be nice to have some more figures that you can draw besides the line, square and circle (for example, 2d or 3d axis, triangle, arrows, dotted line etc.) and the option of filling a figure with a certain color. Another thing that can be better are the sync options, OneDrive or GoogleDrive are currently not supported for example."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really cheap for the whole package and great for taking notes! The stylus system just isn't that optimized yet so the writing is a little off."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app for anybody"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't understand why this app doesn't have a desktop widget that pins a not or a list of notes to the desktop."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad experiences"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my Chromebook Pro, I use it all the time for taking notes in class. Only wish it went full screen so the bottom dock bar would go away, as buttons sometimes get pressed! (EDIT: I realized you can press the full-screen button on the physical keyboard and the dock goes away!) Pro version, which includes importing PDF files, is $1.00 a month which is well worth the cost of paper for notes I would normally be buying. 😁"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Loving the features, however using this on an Tab S4 the ink comes out wrinkled not smooth. Also the selection of tools is tedious. Imagine doing math on this making tons of mistakes opening closing a drawer isn't efficient. Support for the a pen button would be amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Good but overpriced. Autodesk sketch offers more writing tools for around 1/4 the price this app wants for just a measely 4 extra tools. Support is also not the most helpful, choosing to ignore me after they got their point across and wouldn't listen to further feedbacks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm having problem with the paper. Everyday I always study about math and circuit topics, and i needed paper to use as scratching paper.Using paper as a scratch is consuming a lot.So I decided to search for this app and it has everything i need , everything bro!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app was charging my account without being installed even. Highly fake"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is This is good for phone pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Doesn't have a subfolder. Its hard to order the stuff I write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best sketching and note taking app I've found. Perhaps some extra pen styles would be good for sketching diagrams, but I also get the minimalist focus on simple, effective note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool for taking notes - zooms, and erases nicely! Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is definitely the best note app I have found available for android or chrome os, but it still has nothin on notability in the ios store. It would be nice if squid would try to emulate some more of what notability got right. All in all though, great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Paper, accelerated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"PALM REST or PALM REJECTION ,pleaseee"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add an infinite page, so we can add pdf file and write on it as onenote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really wish there was a 'bin' button on the bottom or top bar that would enable you to quickly clear the current page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I need. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app wish it could transfer data to my phone on which I have Squid as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Absolutely rubbish! The only good thing about is the low latency hand writing. The rest is to rip you off! Who could have thought that you have to pay on a monthly basis to use ONE of the additional papers! There others around the corner that do much more and at a far more sensible price!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app. I use it a lot. Thanks for providing it for free. Good fob"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Honestly a Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This really is my #1 s-pen app for both my galaxy note 8 phone and s4 tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"possibly the best note taking and organization app to use with lenovo yogabook or similar pen focused devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I use it on my pixelbook and my phone to take class notes and highlight our pdf readings for classes. it's just what I was looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its the best note taking app I have found for handwritten notes on a tablet. I use it for everything. The importing PDF feature is especially nice for taking notes in class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best one I've tried on Android. Good Note structure, good tools, good palm rejection (if not perfect). I use an Spen and prefer this over the two other major contenders. Premium features are meager compared to just buying the tools and manually backup to a cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app when compared with all the other apps that I've used for notetaking on my tablets. I use it all the time to take notes during class/ doing assignments/ doodling. One of my favorite is that I could use my s-pen for writing and erasing, and also my fingers to select portion of the notes. Worth paying for the premium for importing pdf - it was able to import my 1000 page textbook without trouble; and premium didn't even cost a cup of coffee. Love the app. Something I would love to see in the next update(?) would be a button where I could save the preset of the ""default pen"" that I use often so that I don't need to scroll on the pen thickness to get the exact thickness I want during classes. (for me it 0.5mm and 0.7mm thickness difference matters haha)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its a very nice app, really help me with every kind of anotation. I would like to see a directory sistem. Instead of see my documents i could see the directories, something like that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The PDF importing function needs to be more streamlined. Squid should take into account that many of the people using this app (especially, especially the paid version) have many PDFs to import at once. A multi import would be useful, as would a setting for default sorting of the PDF selection menu (instead of being sorted by name). Turning pages in a multi-paged PDF on tablet should also be more streamined. Currently, the button is small and I often tap the page selection button accidentally instead. Other than that, it's a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for note-taking with my Pixelbook. Infinite pages are awesome. Marking up a multi-page PDF is also hard to find in a notes app, but Squid makes it super easy, and it works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for pdf markup to test it and it isn't very good. I'd request a refund since I couldn't try it first but there is no function for that! One star will have to suffice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love handwriting but I hate paper, this is the perfect solution!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Convenient, easy to use, saves automatically. I like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"tis a good notetaking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"very awesome on my laptop for school work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's easy to operate and also to locate your notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Impressive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BUY FOR CHROME OS. WRIST CONSTANTLY OPENS MENU WHEN WRITING."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very simple and fun to use. It is the closest thing you get to paper notebooks and I use it every day in college with my samsung tablet. There's no fancy calligraphy pens but makes for it in practicality. I highly recommend this to anyone new to tablets but is trying to go paperless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is like drawboard PDF. it does everything I need with PDFs and annotating on it...just perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recently switched over to digital note taking for college and this app has allowed me to take even better notes than I could by hand. I use the Samsung galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S Pen (which I highly recommend as a cheaper work/school tablet), and the stylus support with button and finger tools allows me to never really worry about switching between tools, as it's all contained in one hand.There would definitely be a benefit if they allowed multiple device syncing, which they don't have yet. This hasn't held me back at all, though, so 5 stars right now! I do highly recommend upgrading to the premium if you plan on using this for class or work like I do. It's more than worth it for the price!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Needs spell check but other than that, best note app I know."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app works very well with my chromebook and also offers several stylus settings to make taking notes easy. i love being able to make annotations on pdf documents. my critiques are 1. i wish it had integration with google drive. 2. the text function is not at all user friendly. i paid extra for this feature and was trully disappointed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it forall my notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love this app, it is so helpful for taking notes in my college courses. There are, however, a few features that I wish could be added/modified. It would be nice if you could erase specific areas of something you've written or drawn, instead of erasing everything that I wrote/drew prior to lifting my pen (ex: cursive). I also wish that it were an option to turn handwriting into text and be able to convert it into a Google Doc for easier edits later on. I love handwriting notes because I feel like I can retain the information better, but sometimes, I like the look of typed notes better and I don't always have time to type my notse after writing them. Lastly, it would be really nice to be able to multitask while using the app. I often watch lecture videos and read my electronic textbooks on my Google Pixelbook while taking notes on the screen, and only being able to do one or the other in tablet mode is not very efficient. I would really appreciate it if some of these concerns could be addressed. I think a few adjustments would make this app even more awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great premium features and a smooth experience at a fair price. Some features could be added to improve user experience, such as the ability to add a page to the middle of a note, instead of having to add the page to the end of a mote and then moving it to where you want it. This can be a hassle when you're dealing with 100+ page PDFs. Also, we should be able to export multiple notes at once. Overall, good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it, pressure responsive and great writing tools. Wish it had ppt editor so I didn't have to download a whole seperate app for it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish it would sync with my other devices. Otherwise amazing program!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app, handles the basics nicely. I'm definitely able to use this to get work done and for the most part it stays out of my way. I will mention, since sometimes the devs read these, that I find the UI to be a bit clunky at times. For instance, I am often transfering between different modes (pencil, highlight, etc) and each transfer takes two button presses followed by a menu-clearing action. I really feel like this should be doable in a single action. Additionally, I am often times switching between different colors/thicknesses or have things that I am copying and pasting regularly. Two very useful features would be (a) color/line-thickness presets for both shapes and writing, and (b) a 'palette' where figures I have drawn can be saved for later use. A walk through of (b) would be: i. I draw a figure and decide to save it for later ii. I highlight the figure and touch button 'add-to-palette', adding the highlighted figure. iii. Later, I want to reuse my figure. I select the palette icon which presents a dropdown of thumbnail icons of each figure. iv. I select one figure and it pastes to the screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have already paid for this! Why am I being prompted to pay again"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great for taking notes on an android or chrome OS device!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use note app. Tried other ones before this one but the seamless erasing with the finger is awesome. The only thing missing is sync across device but the backups are pretty easy to make so it's not the end of the world or anything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is outstanding for handwriting notes, HOWEVER, its lacks multi device sync which is nearly a deal breaker. I bring my tab s3 everywhere now because if this. I haven't forgot it it at home yet, but that will only be a matter of time. Because of this limitation I would be hesitant to recommend this app to other power users. If you don't mind this, this app has great s-pen recognition and the notes look beautiful. I would recommend adding a tagging system. I will delete evernote if this feature is added."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not so good..as I taught"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well on the chromebook x2. I can now take notes and brainstorm without a paper notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most useful app I use for work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app functions well with the new pixelbook and is so far the best app to use the pixelpen with. While I would be more than happy to pay for added features, I am unwilling to subscribe. Subscriptive services is one of the reasons I no longer use microsoft products, I would simply like to buy my software outright. That being said, given the quality of software, I wouldn't be apposed to paying for premium content. EDIT: Read their reasoning on the website and can't really say I blame them. I would argue that I paid $50 before for far less useful software and I would gladly pay upwards of that for Squid, but I suppose markets change, yeah, oh well. If there's a suggestion box, add notebook covers to the UI in recent notes, so that I don't have to open the hamburger menu to sort."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic writing app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The pdf editor is definitely worth the money for the pro version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On many devices I really like this app and heartily recommend it to friends and colleagues. I've noticed a bug though that only seems to affect the Acer Spin 11 (with the ""feel"" by Wacom stylus). If you move out of the app to say the notification bar you get awful flickering and colour changes- made me think the screen was broken on the laptop! I have been unable to reproduce the effect in the other apps I have installed. If this bug is removed then its five stars from me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Cost $$$"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"almost perfection, needs to work easier with google drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I tried to use this app on my chrome book and it ran well, bur it wanted to to pay just to type."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best note taking app because the subscription is super cheap and there are so many page types that you can use according to your need. I Love everything else but we need it on windows as well and we need ""x and y coordinate"" graph in shapes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app with lots of options. I use it for class and it works very smooth. Highly recommend."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. I use it almost every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"In short, this app is amazing, but only if you're willing to pay for the premium features. If you don't you get an app that literally does nothing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is one of the best note taking apps for Android because it does allow PDF insertion into notes and the skeleton of the UI is quite well organized but colors used for UI design will definitely make some users look for other alternatives"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish you could edit text after typeing but overall best note app ever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good, but i little expensive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredibly useful, versatile, and easy to learn. $1 a month for all premium features is very fair. Highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my favourite function. I can sign Pdfs without needing to print and then scan. Also use a lot to annotate notes and give my students feedback. However can't give 5 stars, as I originally paid for the full version, but subscription mode has changed to monthly or yearly and I have lost out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente para las notas de la universidad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Upgrade to premium to unlock pdf features, isn't worth time to do that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"We need drive exporting. My university, and many others use GSuite. That's unlimited drive space. Unfortunately this app doesn't let you utalize it at all. You can't even export in bulk locally to select Drive on your own. Come on!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome App love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app of its kind in my opinion; still room for improvement. I use it every day and glad it's there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's just like drawing. It does not resize, place your text, it doesn't tidy it. It's literally just a drawing app. & It's not sophisticated enough to even mind map/ drag & drop gobbets of text onto a single page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for annotating pdfs on android or chromebooks. Nothing else 
comes close. My only wish is that it were easier to access my library

missing it?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be a 5 star app (in my opinion) if I could scroll the notes down 
instead of having to make another page each time I run out of space... 
Despite that, it's my primary note taking app for my Note8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app was good for alike minded people like me because I love to make 
quick notes every time but I have to open book and write stuff. This squid 
take notes app helps me a lot... Thank you ppl for your work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love the handwriting. Really needs to sync across devices, Google drive

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Okay, I might not be the best candidate to write a objective review because 
I've been using it for only 15 minutes. However, I've gotta say YES THIS 
APP MEETS ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. As soon as my stylus touched the screen and 
I started writing, I knew this has got to be the best handwriting app out 
there. Premium has some features I really want, but giving the fact that I 
send you guys feedback earlier this morning and it's now available in my 
country, you guys have just won all of my confidence. Imma be paying for 
premium for sure and help this app become even better!!! I am way too in 
love with this app. THANKS A LOT!!! I LOOOOVVEEEE the pressure sensitivity

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful and easy to use. But it should be more effective if 
this one can edit page with photo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The note taking app I've been searching for! This app includes support for PDF markup, pressure-sensitive styli, images, geometry (rectangles, loops & lines), selection tool, infinite canvas, and tons of other options. My only wish was that this also came on the Windows Store so I could view/sync my notes on my computer. The premium version is easily worth five times the price they charge. Notes never become blurry thanks to the vector-based build. It would be nice if it were possible to pin toolbars (like the color and tool picker) open so that changing ink color—or switching between the pen and selection tool—are just one tap away. Such a feature would be fantastic for taking detailed notes during more fast-paced lectures."

for better funcionality 1. ability to rotate pages in PDFs. Often times I 
get PDFs where the pages are rotated every which way. 2. Ability to resize 
and edit text boxes and the ability to move them after they are placed. 
Once they are placed they can't be editied. 3. Ability to copy markups and 
text. My markups are very often reoccuring. 4. Wishlist: Add layers. I 
often have comments that are for myself and comments for the intended 
recipient. It would be great if there was a layer I could turn off / turn

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste of money - the tutorial shows that it can highlight and type, so I 
purchased the PDF import option. However, to highlight or type in the 
imported PDF, I need to buy another add on. I've already sunk $5 into this 
free app, not sinking anymore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Need to be able to change background/ page Color!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Seems like a useful app, but advertising that it can markup pdf files as a 
free app is misleading. It can, but it's an in-app purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I tried this for about five minutes. To use text or eraser you have to buy 
the full version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easiest app to use with Spen for taking reviews"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the most comprehensive note taking app I have used. It works well 
with my Galaxy tab with s pen. I use it in place of a notebook for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Lack basic features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great but I think it neads a keyboard mode"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried them all and this is the best. Regular updates, handles large 
drawings easily, great cloud sync. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple controls and a clean layout get out of the way of your drawings and 
notes. One feature I love, is that you can use a single finger to pan while 
still allowing drawing input via a ""pen"". The cloud sync backup/restore 
works well and different devices can have sperate backups, such as tablet 
and phone. Cons:Shape support is limited to circle/oval, rectangle, and 
straight line. While you can scale a selection, there is no support for 
rotating selected objects."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, works great with Pixel Chromebook stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best not taking app. If you have a stylus on your Android device, get 
this app. This app is the main reason I now am saving up for a galaxy tab 
3. Need the impressive functionality this app gives you but on the big 
screen. Best app for brainstorming, note taking, idea generation, 
wireframing just an all round amazing tool for creativity."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed to take notes on the go effectively. Love this app and 
use I think everyday. No problems with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing replacement for hand written notes, with writing that looks like my 
own with a stylus. Great for going paperless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think the functional aspect of being able to write on the documents is 
great. However, there is limited organization available. There is no 
ability to put a subfolder inside a main folder which really limits how 
well organize you can be. Additionally, as far as I can tell there is no 
option to view a list version of your documents. It only allows for 
thumbprint images, which means only a few documents takes up a significant 
amount of space on your computer screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is working on mi phones also"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app easy to use has all the basics but I feel like there should 
be more features to help you manage your notes and notebooks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app is great but there are small things that makes the note taking 
experience worse, such as not able to scroll to other page rather u have to 
press the next button to go to the next page. Most important lack of proper 
subfolders, tags etc to organize the notes. Also the UI needs some 
improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Im really satisfyed with this app but i have one gripe. I own a chromebook 
pro and samsung galaxy s7 and i want to use this app as my primary note 
taking app but as far as i see there is no sync between accounts and 
devices which is the only thing that is preventing me from switching"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app to sketch, note, and work PDFs. I always recomend it and have been 
using for years and will continue"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Please add a page mode called vertical infinite that only lets the page 
scroll vertically. (let us pick the width in pixels) 😔 I've been a paid 
user for a very long time and this is the feature I've been missing the 
most. 😒 It's such an easy feature to implement but would make the whole 
note taking experience so much better for me 😑 5 stars as soon as this is 
added!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"How to use palm rejection?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it's sad to have to pay for insert texts"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like ur notes app because it is very likely to use and to get satisfied ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best way to study on Android. Premium is accessible and has a lot of 
great features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't have a feature to convert hand written notes into typed 
text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It was a very nice looking app and the features appealed to me but after buying the subscription and importing my PDF (a custom planner) it was completely unable to load more than one page at a time and crashed repeatedly. The links in the PDF that were meant to help navigate didn't work either. I know I only spent a dollar but I was really hoping this was what I was looking for. Very dissatisfied that I couldn't use it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good than others"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"it was the only reasonable app for note taking that i can find. fluid with 
stylus until recently.. what's wrong?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"the was good. if this was one time payment only to access prime features it 
would be great. why not make it one time payment?. i dont like paying apps 
subscription every month or every year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"１００ of 10. The best!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app that is well supported by the Pixelbook. I wish it had 
integration with the lockscreen to quickly create notes, support for 
typing, and support for writing to text recognition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for notes and writing on documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for what it aims to do, which is being a handwriting app. The 
writing engine is the most responsive that I've used, at least on my 
Chromebook pro. The online integration is not great (you can sync to 
dropbox, but only at regularly scheduled intervals) and there is no 
handwriting recognition like Google Keep, but the pen support is so much 
better that I've replaced Keep with Squid for the most part. Worth the 
subscription!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notetaking app for chromebooks with stylus, without question."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would be helpful if you could have customized pen options do that it is 
easier to switch from one preset option to another. Like a yellow 
highlighter to a red pen. Also... A calligraphy pen would really be loved..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Can't imagine what I would do without it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what's required of stylus app. Minimal ink 'flow lag'"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. It makes got taking really easy and colorful. I 
just wish changing pens and colors was easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app for taking notes with a stylus. Would be 1000000% better if you 
could organize your notes into a folder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have used this forever, love it!!!! I have the premium subscription 
allowing me to sign PDF's!!! Awesome app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Subscription model for a note taking app!? Really?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Would love for it to sync between devices and have a 
collaboration tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Be perfect if it synced to one note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Notes or doodles, this app does it all! I loved using it for school. Pretty 
much my only notebook all throughout college."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty easy to use to annotate or sign PDF docs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this. So helpful in so many ways. Plus super easy to use and navigate 
through."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty sweet handwriting app. Thanks for the hard work at making this so 
perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you own an android tablet that comes with a decent stylus and are 
looking for a note taking app that handles handwritten input well, look no 
further. This app will do what you want it to and more. The subscription 
payment model is annoying but given the abysmal ecosystem of android tablet 
apps,I understand the developer's choice ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love this app. Very fluid writing with the s pen on my Note 8 & 
Chromebook Pro. But there's the biggest problem... NO SYNC BETWEEN 
DEVICES!!! Or at least being able to backup to Google Drive would be nice. 
This lack of easily working between two or more devices is what is keeping 
this rating at 3 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think this app is awesome! I love that it has (1) the option to buy 
outright only the upgrade options you require, (2) the ability to create 
folders for notes (3) the import pdf option (I used that straight away!) 
(4) Saving & exporting WITHOUT re cloud - essential for those of us with 
confidential info, (5) great export options, (7) page sizes that expand in 
any direction you want(7) easy change in colours (8) lots of options to set 
how use gestures & stylus, & (9) fantastically small export file sizes. I 
would have given a 5 star rating if you could (1) choose the default folder 
you could have it open in, (2) have subfolders (3) be able to see the full 
name of a note when in a folder (4) choose to see the notes as a list 
rather than a thumbnail & MOST OF ALL, (5) a textbox where can wrap text & 
adjust the size & shape of the entry. This problem with the textbox going 
off in one line ad infinitum is a fault at needs to be corrected. 
Otherwise, my team have all chosen Squid as their default work tool to take 
clinical notes with clients in the field using their Samsung Note8 phones. 
If the textbox issue was fixed, the app would be perfect for our needs! 
Thanks for having the best option available."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to upgrade to markup pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Was looking for an app that actually allows me to make handwritten notes 
cause i learn better that way, but i mostly use my tablet to study, and I'm 
loving this so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's not free You should have said so I'm poor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. Although I'd like more organization similar to Onenote. Can the 
folders have sections? Feel like I need another layer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very large ""paper"" make it usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredibly easy to import PDFs and sign or otherwise draw on them. Export 
function works like a charm. Using with Samsung Chromebook Pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the best for taking notes on a Samsung Chromebook Pro. I wish 
it allowed me to set a separate action for mouse clicks as for pen touches. 
I'd love to be able to have clicks insert text rather than use the primary 
tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I WANT TO TAKE IT FOR PDF MARKUP...BUT AFTER INSTALLING IT SAY UPGRADE 
VERSION AFTER PAY 330 RUPEE.....SO AMBIGUOUS ADVERTISEMENTS..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is beyond amazing! Only few hours using the basic pack..... and I just 
bought the premium service. Not regretting the decision at all!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used this for years on an old Galaxy Note 8 tablet with S-Pen, and 
it has served me well. But I recently got a pixelbook, and wow, Squid is 
the perfect pen based note-taking app for it. Somehow they've eliminated 
the latency and made it feel exactly like writing on paper, only better. If 
you have a pixelbook, get the pen and then get this app. And by the way, 
the premium subscription is worth it just to be able to have stationary 
like engineering pads (which I use every day)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Reminds me of Microsoft Word, with a million features that no one will use 
and an inability to do the simplest things adequately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app with fluid pen input on Chromebook Plus. Only two issues/requests 
is to reduce the rendering time when panning, and if possible provide 
folders or organization within a notebook? I.e., separate out pages into a 
sub group within a notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, very useful. I use this everyday. I'd have a difficult day 
at work without it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is great for everything you need it for i love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! The pdf overwriting is great for school!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool for note and draw your ideas."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have loved and used this app for several months. I used it daily! I woke 
up this morning and it was wiped clean. Signing in was like for the first 
time. I could find no way to restore it. I am so beyond frustrated. I will 
go back to using a trustworthy store bought notebook. Never again. I lost 
it all! Everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thats What I wanted!...I paid for pdf import and works fine.Thank you very 
much and i am sure that squid team will keep on latest and improved updates 
on regular time for more better experience..I just want full screen writing 
mode for better teaching"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note app, vector drawing help for engineering student"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is bitching, in a good way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app to import and markup PDFs... and love it! In 
addition to being able to write and highlight, I can add pages at the end 
for additional notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Boo!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bakwaass"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this as a teacher on a Samsung Chromebook Plus with an S-Pen. It 
works great for what I need it for, and it is lag free which puts it ahead 
of the Samsung apps for the chromebook. If there was a cloud sync option, 
this would easily be a 5-star resource. Please add this feature!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After using the app for some time, all my notebooks just vanished. No idea 
on how to recover them... Certainly not what I expected from a rather 
expensive app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great for taking handwritten notes, but convoluted syncing and no Google 
Drive support hobble this otherwise useful app. If they added multi device 
syncing and more 'one tap' controls on tablets this would be a must have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Amusing, but not quite useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great handwriting app. Easy to use. Stylus is pressure sensitive. Five star 
at what it does. Could improve backup for just selected notebooks or add 
mirroring. Could add organizational system like OneNote given how poor the 
android version of OneNote is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be 5 stars if you included sync a s part of the features. 
Currently I am using the backup and restore function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It would be simpler if you could just buy the templates you want to use 
rather than having to have a subscription. Who wants a subscription?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great notetaking app! I'm using it to do math questions for the GMAT prep, 
and it's saving trees! I'm no longer using pads and pads of graph papers! I 
love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Misleading. Unable to mark up PDF's unless you pay monthly or yearly fee."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used this to take notes for classes and meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant. I am loving my paperless life!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I take back my old review. picnic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Opened pasted requires premium uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is overall great. You can import pdf files and markup if you get 
the premium, which is worth it if you are reading a lot of pdfs. My only 
complaint is that the pressure sensitive pen option is not as good as it 
can be. The useful pressure range remains small and most of the time you 
end up writing either very thin or very thick. It would be great if they 
could more options to the pressure setting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gooo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is the only non Google app that seems to be optimised for the stylus 
on the Google Pixelbook. It is very smooth and a great experience to 
write/sketch/diagram with. The negatives for me are that you get a limited 
set of backgrounds to use. If you want to use more or import your own, you 
can't just upgrade to a one off premium version. You have to purchase a 
monthly subscription which is just not worth it. This one money making 
measure for me limits the usefulness of this app. I have purchased the 
tools upgrade for £2.89. This lets me use all the tools (highlighter, etc.) 
I would have like a similar upgrade option for the backgrounds too but 
sadly not the case. I am still therefore on the lookout for an alternative 
that offers more freedom for a one off upgrade cost."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Works with a pen or your finger"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bought the premium version for a whole $10 and I can't even scroll through 
the page; I have to tap the arrows (which is really annoying). The 
highlight feature that I paid for ends up looking really messy and doesn't 
isolate the text for a clean look for my notes. Can't even annotate with 
text like I hoped. I want a refund."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on a Samsung Chromebook Plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for studying and tab s3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried lots of different Handwriting programs. Squid was not my first 
choice, but it did a few things better than all the others. The main thing 
was that it worked tolerably at a high resolution on my tablet. Others were 
far too slow to work at my top resolution. The second thing that it did was 
that I could import and export PDF's. Other programs had other features 
that I wanted, but did not need. For example, Squid did not zoom, but that 
really did not matter because I did not need it. Still others handled 
drawings better or had more robust file management, but these were usually 
coupled with intolerably slow Handwriting rendering. Squid had the features 
that I needed and worked fine at high resolution. I have used Squid as my 
Handwriting program for several months and I have grown to like it quite a 
bit over time. There are many improvements I could suggest, but nothing I 
suggest would matter over what it already does and does well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"helping me a Lot. my homeworks have been easy to do"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for quite some time now and it is awesome. I came 
across another app (LectureNotes) which is really cool too. I think i'll be 
switching over to that app because they allow for me to create a Notebook 
WITHIN a notebook - which makes university life so much simpler. I will 
switch back to Squid when this feature is added. Any idea of when (or even 
if) if its going to happen?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and works great! Some minor functionallity missing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not very sensitive to the s-pen, which makes writing very thin lines, 
regardless of the width. The add-ons are expensive if you don't want to do 
a subscription service. I would recommend instead the s-notes and 
inkredible apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Doesn't allow simple cut and paste. Makes it worthless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Changed my life as a schoolkid with chronic pain. No more 
carrying around bulky notebooks, just my Note 8 and Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect, easy to use and incredibly useful. I subscribed for a 
dollar a month and I can put PDFs of all my textbooks on it, take notes 
right on the books and insert pages wherever. There are TONS of page 
backgrounds, and tons of colors and options to write on them. I could not 
ask for a better app at a better price. 100% worth the money for the 
subscription, no question. This app is the only writing app I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for field reports write on templates t if at are pdf awsome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for university study - being able to snip diagrams from lectures

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"downloaded the free version and could not even open a pdf in the app 
without paying for the premium version. This should be advertised as such."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app really. I really enjoyed my bullet journalling using this 
app. It's almost perfect. One thing that I would want to suggest though is 
that maybe you could add more text font to it or atleast we can download 
and customize the fonts because it only contains only one font. Maybe it 
will be better if will have some options to it so as purchasing the 
additional tool will be much worthy for the price. Plus, a lasso tool that 
makes a copied picture text to make it transparent would be nice too just 
like the goodnotes app in ipad. ☺"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic when taking notes! It's very organized with various 
and useful tools making note taking simple and easy! Highly reccomend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just bought the tool pack on my galaxy tab s3, but i dont know how to

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good! Pen to draw, finger to erase just like real whiteboard"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this one! It is simple yet has nice little features to 
make my writing it's best. I use it to take unexpected notes at work as 
needed and I don't Lose them anymore! as well as use the grid to produce 
hand written to scale flooring drawings. Nice replacement for Samsung S 
Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best handwriting app that I know of on Android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I use it for all my highschool notes. It is by far the 
best writing experience on an android tablet that I have seen. But there 
are two things I would love to see done better. First I would love it to 
have more options with notebooks, maybe having the option to create 
multiple notebooks within notebook. I also feel the tools could have more 
customization, for instance, what if I want the square template but also 
want the pen opacity to be down? It would also be nice to store different 
pens that I use, I like taking my main notes in black and then adding Sub 
notes in pink but also with a smaller pen width, I don't want to have to 
toggle both of those when trying to change pens, especially during class.it 
would be nice to all my favourite pen set ups just a click away."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best nottaking app ever! I use it on my chromebook with the chromebook pen 
and it feels like real paper. Super easy and intuitive, pressure sensitive, 
and it knows the difference between the pen for writing, my palm when it 
accidentally touches the screen, and my finger when I erase! Amazing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It isn't perfect, but it offers a lot of cool things, and with a few bucks 
you can have all you need. I tried numerous apps for taking notes during 
lectures, and this one is the best one so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love the options for page layouts and how similar it is to writing with pen 
to paper, but the fact I can't use the same account on multiple devices is 
having me look elsewhere. I write notes on my Chromebook then want the 
ability to view those notes on my Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It would be great to change page more easily, either by swiping or as 
continuous page. Then it's 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Marking up a jpg/png is what i am looking for, this feature is missing in 
chrome default picture editor. This product has that, without asking for 
internet or cloud signup. Good and handy one for the purpose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"love its responsiveness and accuracy. i just miss the feedback of an actual 
pen otherwise, it is near perfect for my needs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty accurate writhing and fast app. The best android app I've found. 
Some constructive critics: But I would like to see a easy way to cut and 
paste image parts, maybe integrated with the s pen. Need more pens and 
maybe some shortcuts for them. Other thing here helpfully is a box to 
writhing in the tablet button while the text appear above. The upad app for 
ios does a great job with that, and if well done is super usefully. 
Continue the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The scroll does not work.. Even though it's mentioned as an infinite 
scroll. Or rather if it's there.. It's not intuitive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No. The app says it is easy to write with like a pen and paper but it is 
like using other apps nothing is different. And u need to pay to use paper. 
THIS APP SUCKS AND I HATE IT. Get better apps that will help >:["
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App, needs synching, otherwise good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best in whole lot. Very good and simple design and work 
flawlessly on my tab s3. Only issue is that there is no sync option between 
devices and we need this for sure like if I need to sync between my tab and 
note devices or with my chrome laptop etc. Rest is great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works well, I just wish it work offline with Google drive. Right 
now it only works with box and Dropbox which I don't use. I also wish you

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried a few apps and I find this offer the best writing experience. It 
would be nice if this app can add one more level of category / 
classification like oneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"help stay organized"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would absolutely love this app if a few things were changed. One: 
highlight could drop to the back of the text being highlighted, two: option 
to move the shapes to the back of the text (i.e. When used to underline 
text), three: cover options for the notebooks, four: ability to back up 
with Google drive and one drive. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs page scrolling"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A very intuitive app but I have you can add palm rejection mode so my hand 
can rest while taking note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use for design the shape drawing tools are usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app for taking notes on my tablet. Better than default version, 
for sure"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app a lot. Really good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Smooth usage for Pixelbook and Google Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Meets all basic note taking needs but could use some extras, like different 
kinds of pen or brushes for the more artsy users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would get 5-stars if it integrated with cloud storage options more easily. 
The note taking capabilities are out of this world."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app, very useful in class. The text tool could be more useful though. 
I bought it with intention to swicht from MS Word android version on 
Pixelbook, but instead I just draw graphs and write math in it and then 
insert the screenshot of it into MS Word. definitely can't replace text 
note taking apps, but for stylus is perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, Easy to use and very effective with a great pen interface for 
chromebooks and tablets"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"what it does do, it does well. I am annoyed though at the lack of an 
""insert audio"" function on the android version. It should be able to do all 
that Google Keep does for free, and more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good support for handwriting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy to use app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An incredible app. It is very quick and stable. Even at ""infinite pages"" it 
maintains a fast load. I just wish there was a sync function like a sign-in 
to a personal account so that when using other devices the notes are 
available. Besides that I am very satisfied!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it ❤❤👍👌"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Reading a PDF is simply terrible. The app can't read the index table of a 
file, you can't touch the links inside a file so you can navigate 
throughout the references, you can't bookmark pages... You have to pay for 
the option of importing pdf and when you pay, this is all you get: a reader 
which lacks all the basic reading features. I'm very disappointed with this 
app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The handwriting is pretty identical to my own, there isnt a lag between 
strokes and response, placement is very accurate, and you can add PDF pages 
into your notebook which is great for being able to write on your docs!! I 
love it. I'm definitely subscribing. $10/ year is nothing compared to what 
I wouldve paid for notebooks/printing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to be able to type. That's not free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think it will be a great app, no, the greatest app ever if it works"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's pretty great. My hand accidentally erases what I write so you have to 
be a little careful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great notekeeping app. But it does not have a proper lasso tool. The lasso 
tool selects everything in a rectangle even if we draw the lasso in some 
other shape. Please fix this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very well done infinite digital canvas!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, I use this on a Samsung Galaxy tablet with an s-pen. It's my go 
to app for note taking. The infinite page option is great for diagram 
sketching and then pen sensitivity and tracking accuracy beats the built in 
S Note app for my purposes. Being able to zoom in and annotate in fine 
detail is a great feature, as is the high quality export. The only areas 
where the Samsung app wins out are in more advanced page indexing 
facilities, and built in sound recording. Plenty of app store options for 
audio recording though. Highly recommend if you use your phone or tablet as 
a productivity tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Lowest latency stylus app I've ever used on Chromebook plus. Absolutely 
phenomenal input. One star off for no outright purchase option on premium 
features. it's reasonably priced but I don't like paying a subscription 
forever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Started using squid with my first Android Note tablet. I have tried other 
apps that are similar and ALWAYS come back to squid. I pay for the yearly 
subscription & I am confident that I will never leave. It is the best app 
for using the s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note.Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Writing is smooth unlike evernote and the app has never crashed. Importing 
Pdfs should not be a premium feature, Xodo offers it for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app cannot yet sync between devices, but I love the tools and paper 
size that is really easy for me to make MindMap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for college. It works great for submitting pdf handouts 
with handdrawn figures for class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note taking app. Can handle pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Taking notes and drawing pictures just got a whole lot easier, thanks 
SQUID!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app out there. Probably should only use with Note series 
tho."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It says u can edit pdfs but yoy have to pay for it why though?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note and Hw app for school. I'm doing engineering and this app is 
perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"New update force closes on start, app unusable. My device is samsung galaxy 
s3 tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As a math professor, I downloaded this app as a way to workout homeork 
problems for my students, and to take notes during meetings. This was an 
okay app until I upgraded to premium. It now allows me to take my quizzes, 
tests, class notes, power points, pdf, etc, open them in squid, then write 
over them. Couple this with a screen recording app, and I hope to greatly 
expand my reach as an educator (woe be unto my students). Also, couple this 
with a document scaning app, and now you can scan/import meeting handouts, 
add notes/write over them, and squid will save it as 1 file. It is a great 
way to actually digitize meeting notes and keep your office from getting 
over cluttered with handouts. As a note taking app, the writing reconition 
is very good (just set your s pen button to the eraser); however, I have 
not tried out using pressure sensitivity to adjust writing thickness."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I used to rate this 5 stars but then things that I was using got put behind 
the premium paywall, meaning I now have to pay to use them. As a teacher 
this was instrumental in some of my lessons. To have that removed was very 
frustrating. They do have an EDU licence but the fact it was free to begin 
with was the worst."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Works ok. Just very basic unless you want to upgrade to premium, which it 
kindly reminds you on anything you want to change up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It does a good job, but REALLY needs a search feature. I mean REALLY REALLY."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Is easy to use and convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for quick notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this apps. Thank you Dev. You make me write back. This is apps very 
light and make my write very smooth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app with my Chromebook! I use it for general note taking and 
PDF markup. Great business tool, but I would really like if it could sync 
notes across devices :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A very good notekeeping app; premium version gives plenty of useul tools 
and layout. Easily the best note app for a Pixelbook, which is what I'm on. 
It has crashed a few times though and I've seen others with this device 
have the same issue so for now, 3 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Great to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish it can backup to google drive. Right now, I can see only Dropbox and 
Box."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An awesome app with one drawback currently. Great pen options, reasonable 
premium structure, captured my handwriting exactly as it appears in all my 
pre-teen notes from high school through grad school and beyond. The one 
somewhat misleading element is recognition-turning the chicken scratch to 
text as shown in their videos online. This functionality is apparently only 
available in the Windows version, not Android (or Apple). Rather 
disappointed. I*WILL* be keeping tabs on them though to give another go 
when this comes to Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. It's easy to use and amazing to take notes and do markups with."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The cloud backup needs a lot of work.There should be a simpler way to sync 
the notes than waiting for it to automatically do that at a particular time 
during the day.This is especially problematic when you aren't always online 
throughout the day.A simpler solution would be if the app syncs itself 
every time you open it.Taking away one star because of this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good App. I love how it particularly works with my Samsung Tab A 10.1 using it's built in pen. If I didn't have this pen, I would probably not use this app as much. But that's just my preference."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good, it is quite handy for my chromebook hand writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Definitely worth the subscription! Everything is super seamless and looks amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would definitely buy if premium was a one time purchase rather than a monthly cost. Oh well, time to fix something better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app for taking notes on my lecture slides. The problem that I 
keep having is with slides that have a lot of pictures on them. I end up 
having to wait a long time for those pages to lead, which makes me miss 
some of the notes I want to take down. This is very important to me as 
university classes are very fast paced and profs don't wait for anyone. One 
suggestion would be to have the option to flatten the document as you 
import it onto the app. I personally don't care to have my pages be 
flattened, as I won't be needing to export text or images from my pdfs. I 
understand that some people might still need their content to be separable, 
so I think adding the option to flatten your pdf is better than making it 
the default. Please address this issue this app is extremely helpful 
otherwise."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app , very impressive app to make notes in your own way!!. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I hope only to change the background color but until there I really do love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for samsung galaxy s3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nothing in this particular app raises any red flags in my opinion, although there is room for improvement. Inserting pages for one. Especially  when you forgot to add a few notes in between pages. Yes I know you can zoom in and out, problem is it's time-consuming.   There is a positive side as well, this is by far the best app that I have found on Play Store for my Android device. Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for Android HANDS DOWN"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with lenovo yoga book. Has a preset mode for it that uses touch screen as eraser while you write on the digitizer and it feels really nice. Can use a function that changes page setting for an entire note document(have to do so page by page for now) and an eraser that erases a selected area would be nice as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Failed to work on at all with stylus on pixelbook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great on tablet S3 with pen. I use it instead of paper 100%."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I ♡ it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"what an amazing app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Will give 5 stars if support google drive backup&restore :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I first used this with a Samsung Chromebook Plus and the low latency is truly impressive.  For marking up PDF or simply writing notes, it is fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app still needs work in chrome os"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has done everything I need it to do. Really practical, not stand on your head, hold your nose and write like you don't normally, but a real world writing app. Use it everyday. My go to writing app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. But my issue is that it has this annoying background when you are scrolling down. Please fix this. You have me looking for other apps because of this and somehow I keep coming back to you and deleting all the other apps that I have downloaded. Like I said before I really do love this app. Can you please do something about this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great way to take notes on any phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid on my Pixelbook with the pen. Incredibly low latency. Absolutely exquisite experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Revenue Stream for a app?  Especially one as simple as this?  $10 a year, or $1 a month...  What a joke, and a bad one at that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a PhD candidate in economics, and I could not live without this app. It runs flawlessly on the Google Pixelbook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app there is for writing, taking notes or organizing. Deffinitly upgrade to the preminum subscription. it's worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is just amazing!! Perfect layout, lots of features, lightweight... it's  definitely a must have app for S3 tablet users. My productivity has increased a lot since I started using it. You can pay 10 bucks annually for some extra stuff, and I gladly did so just to support the developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool. Application for many uses."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy using this app for my digital planner. I bought a pen sized stylus to use with it so my handwriting could be more precise. Sometimes when I try to zoom, it writes on my page but it's easy enough to undo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Too many issues, at least on Chromebook Plus. Frequent freezes, black screens, screen flickers. Let developer know about these multiple times. None ever fixed. Consistent across new versions of ChromeOS and app updates. Going to look for a replacement app next semester"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE THE BIG PAGES"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Supports amazing features such as using only the stylus for input combined with using your finger as an eraser. The lasso tool is a winner, better than OneNote's, with it you can change the color and the width of previously made pencil marks. It has a wide array of paper templates, color picker. Its fantastic. Also, you can change the size of the paper, facilitating export/printing, something in which OneNote has greatly failed me before. There is PDF import/export, and editing. 4*only because the writing is pretty clunky, needs smoothing, and there is only one kind of pen. Also, I would like to see notebook subdivisions! Premium subscription is totally worth (10/yr approx 0.83¢/month, Bargain!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Decent app for making notes and drawing. I mainly use it to import screenshots of important pages from ebooks so I can annotate them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this. I brainstorm better with a pen/stylus. Each page can be as long as I need it to be. I can add more pages. Organize them into notebooks. Use tags. I've tried a lot and this one is the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing drawing application!  Zero lag with a number of tools at an very affordable price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid has replaced my paper notebook on my Samsung Chromebook Pro. The writing is very smooth and there is not much delay at all. Writing feels natural. The tools are powerful and easy to use.   I have already recommended this to multiple people and will continue to do so."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app,  it's perfect for writing my school notes on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very stable and intuitive. It's my favourite not taking app on Android and Windows."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking notes.   I only wish could purchase some of the pages instead of an annual fee,  but $10 a year is pretty good if you'll use this a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super convenient Note taking with good editing features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Need pdf transfer even if it's locked"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, well done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's fast and it looks fairly good too. I just wish it had an option to go full screen and hide the titlebar + toolbars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for marking up architectural drawings, it works great.  I'm using it on a Samsung Chromebook Pro and the digital ink is fast and accurate.  Much better than the Adobe Apps.  I also like the variety of notebook backgrounds especially nice having the 4/ inch and the 5 / inch divisions makes it easy to sketch in both arcitectural and engineering if I need to.  Only future suggestion so far would be to allow the grid to show over PDFs  Aside from that I love it.   Easy to learn & Use with just enough options.  Great App,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I recommend it for the Samsung Chromebook Plus/Pro!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I hate this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app  out there. If they had a dark theme this would be the perfect app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you are a student then your NEED this app. (Disclaimer it works best on a phone or chromebook or tablet with a stylus)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for working with PDFs. Only reason I did not give five stars is that there is only continuous scroll with mouse/fingers or next/previous page with the arrow buttons. It would be much more useful with two-page view or a scroll mode that allows swiping/clicking to scroll a whole page at a time. Right now, trying to read using Squid requires careful scrolling to advance to the next page, or constantly pulling down the toolbar to get the arrow buttons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app BUT seriously limited due to the fact that it doesn't play well with google drive. It would be nice to actively save your drawings on drive and work on them from another device. There is some sort of global backup system via drive but that cannot be used to share files. For now you have to create and use your drawings on the same machine unless you save them as png or jpeg and then transfer them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Used to be one of the best. Now it started charging for most of its features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really love this app, the only problem i have with this, is the lack of constant backup on services like google drive or onedrive, and another small thing.. When i upload a notebook as a pdf, the ink is pixelated its not a deal breaker but in a whole, i really love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Una sola pecca, manca la possibilità di scrivere in un riquadro più grande che rappresenta una parte di foglio zoommata in modo da scrovere meglio e mantenere il controllo su tutto il foglio"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would really love if we could put notebooks inside of notebooks. If they acted like typical computer folders it would really help with my organizaion =P"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this on Samsung 12.2 note pro for 4 years. Now looking to move to another tablet but this is h one app that is a MUST use case in deciding which new tablet I choose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect note-taking app; works well with my chromebook plus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for writing math, and public demos (via chromecast)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for handwriting and journaling but poorly handles pasted text. This premium feature is useless for text that is more than a few words long because it doesn't adjust to fit the width of the page. Please fix this feature for a 5 star rating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would get a 5 from me if you can sync back to OneDrive and not just Box or Dropbox"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it esome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"$10/year for a subscription? I'd rather take notes using toilet paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Definitely useful app, but since it charges for the best features, it is a shame you haven't added scrolling with touch screen swipes rather than using press buttons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best ( lowest) latency for Chromebook plus. better than  Google keep."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I have a question..is the tool pack a onetime payment? Or do i need to pay for it on a monthly bases"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I used the paid version of Squid to sign a password-protected PD form.  When I exported it, none of the original document showed up on the pge -- only my signature.  Re-started the app, used different export options, and yet no export with both the original document and my signature.  The only reason I even give a second star is because (1) the note-taking is pretty good and (2) the Active Pen on Pixelbook worked well on Squid.  Don't bother with the paid version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best note taking app around!  More offline templates please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's better than most, maybe the best.  Tired of having to use multiple apps to get all the features I need. There is no note taking app that has it all. It's 2018, come on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is the best app for writing and making notes.... and the best part is its habit saves paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. It might be useful to introduce the button that blocks exiting the app, opening left menu and everything else except pen input."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great app, and especially useful with the use of a stylus. Highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid app    Edit: developers got back to me and lied about it not being a paid app   Edit 2: the simple drawing on the app is free. But there are thousands of free drawing apps out there. If you are trying to edit schoolwork, or write on PDF's, it is not free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"set a one time fee for premium rather than monthly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Hi I can't work out how to change the orientation off the text I'm inputting to the same as the existing text on the pdf? If this is not possible it makes adding comments on to site drawing look very unprofessional. This was the whole reason I subscribed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have and 5 stars to make a difference. Still needs enhancements like total page size, presenting mode, sliding menu bar to see 100 total page. But i have tried them all and from this app I am totally convinced. Well done! Would love to see the ability to add pages everywhere and not only the end of PDF writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Claims to be a PDF annotator, but you can only do that with a annual subscription. Lame. I would buy the app, but not shelling out $10/yr for an app that I use only once in a while"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than a paperback notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Import PDF is not free!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gud😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"On my Samsung Galaxy Note 4, which has a resolution of 2560x1440 and a Super AMOLED display, I use the ""Squid - Take Notes & Markup PDFs"" writing app from the Google play store. And I must say, the writing experience is the closest thing to actually using pencil/pen on paper of a number of popular apps I tested; even better then Samsung's own S Note. The Squid app, which used to be called Papyrus, has near zero latency when writing or drawing. And when comparing Squid to other apps such as Autodesk SketchBook and Wacom's Bamboo Paper on my Note 4, Squid wins hands down. The latency in the other apps is very noticeable, when coming from a Squid writing/drawing session. I use a Staedtler Noris Digital Samsung Pencil, which is sold on Amazon for $19.99."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the app, it does well for certain things. I like to use it for taking notes on floorplans while building homes but as a pure note taking app it has some lacking features. I would love the ability for it to either/or search my handwritten notes or be able to convert my handwritten notes to text. Not the perfect app but one I enjoy using."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic APP, best writing experience on the market!!! I'm waiting for Google Drive support and Real Time Multi-Device Synchronisation to add the 5th star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Premium is totally worth the dollar a month. This lets me take notes on pdfs just like paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb. Simple, effective, easy to use. Would appreciate autosharing across devices and more Cloud support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app really helps me with high school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Pen input apt for notes and PDF annotation on Chromebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the way this app allows me to make notes on pdfs and saves it even when I'm offline. One suggestion I have is to have scrollable pdf pages - ie: not have to click arrows to go to the next page but rather scroll from one page to the next."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's alright for annotating pdfs such as lecture notes but useful features are behind a paywall/subscription. Free version doesn't allow typing which is pretty annoying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Love the photos showing what it can do. But if you want to inport anything guys itll cost you $7 for premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic! I have used most of the note taking apps on Android and this one stands out. It has great spen support with the alt button, great cloud sync functionality, somthing many apps in this category lack, and a nice UI. I use this app regularly everyday for notes in class as well as from a textbook and have no major complaints, only that I wish the resolution on handwriting was a bit higher. Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only real issue is that it tends to erase waaaaayyy too easily. Bumping the wrong button, swiping the wrong way can cost some important work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE it :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use, wonderful for a stylus, and cheap!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All is well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful, easy just to turn on my tablet and start taking notes. 📝"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"University Student. I use this with my chromebook - Samsung CB+. I only wish I knew how to change the size of the eraser, and to set my own finger gestures (I don't like scrolling with 2 fingers in edit mode, not sure what the better alternative would be however). None the less this is excellent and allows me to leave my paper and pen at home."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A fantastic mix of simplicity and power. Perfect for noting meetings, reviewing PDF and creative mind mapping."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great functionality. Very versatile. Love the engineering paper template. Very quick and efficient use of the eraser and lasso tool. Onvenient for lecture note taking and great orginization. Quick and easy PDF saves. Only con I could say is there is not a rich text assistant. Overall a fabulous app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app does everything I want it to - but please add the functionality to select multiple notes and batch-export them (eg. Exporting a collection of notes to PDF and saving them to Drive)"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried lots of handwriting apps, and was never truly satisfied. Finally, I think I've found the one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As a teacher, this has been my go-to for creating answer keys without the hassle of scanning or wasting paper!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has changed the way I grade student work. It's improved turn-around time and helped students improve their writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using Squid for several months.  I think it is excellent.  I wish there was a little more organizational features, like folders inside of folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for stylus notes, but 2 main things are missing for me.  1)  The ability to have notes backup to Google Drive in addition to Dropbox and Box.  I'm a teacher and my board uses Google Apps For Education and use Google Drive.  2)  The ability to auto sync between devices, I own a PixelBook and Android Tablet with Pen (Samsung S3).  I move back and forth, as I sometimes need the smaller tablet for notes and other times the larger PixelBook.  Would be nice to have them sync to each other."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for notes taking on the planet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app, along with a stylus I use to ""write"" on the screen of my tablet, has become an integral part of my work day.  Handwriting notes cements them better in my memory, and the ability to import a PDF and mark it up is immensely helpful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app at work for my daily note taking.  So far my only complaint is in the inability to open two notebooks at the same time.  I take general notes and project specific notes in separate notebooks and would like to be able to have two open at the same time a sometimes I need to reference information from one notebook to the next."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using this on my Samsung Chromebook Pro and I've not had one issue. I'm a first semester law student and I'm already getting so much use out of this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using with Samsung Pro chromebook, works great as note takng app and as well to do my homework assignments."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recently got a Samsung Chromebook Pro for school, and I absolutely LOVE taking notes with this app.  I can have separate notebooks for all my different classes, I can use their infinite pages to fit an entire lecture's notes on a single page, making it really easy to find the notes from a specific day.  I'm pretty sure my classmates are all really grateful that I can easily turn my notes into a pdf that I can email to them too.  Lots of customization in how the pen works (I've found that 0.3 without pressure sensitivity works best for me).  I love the zoom feature.  It's really nice when you want to write small notes about something but you don't want to take up a whole line. I paid the few extra bucks for the ""premium"" upgrade, which if I remember correctly included the highlighter option, which is quite nice as well.  The premium package also has a bunch of other page templates like graph paper and stuff which I'll probably never use, but I'm sure would be super handy for someone else.  Honestly, I think my only complaints is that the highlighter doesn't look right... but that could just be that I haven't played around with the settings enough.  I've also had a couple crashes, but I've never lost anything and it's pretty rare and doesn't even take long to restart the app. I definitely recommend this app if you have a tablet with a stylus.  EDIT:  I can't believe I forgot to mention my absolute favorite feature!  THE UNDO BUTTON! I use it so often that I've actually found myself reaching for it when I make a mistake on actual paper!  The eraser is really nice too because it can get rid of an entire penstroke at once (though you can swap so that it only erases what you want too).  And I use the lasso tool a ton when I want to move things around, or copy and paste diagrams and stuff.  Honestly, I love how clean I can make my notes with this app (and how easy it is to do so)!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful for taking notes in class"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Shave a Samsung Chromebook and at first  Iwas dissapointed (using Onenote) I had a very noticeable delay in the stylus writing strokes.    THIS APP changed everything!! no lag in the stylus writing strokes  YAY"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I send Screen Captures as PDFs after I mark them up"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Note Takin app so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app works nice but it'd be nice to have a multi sync to other devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good but still lacks a couple of things: - On tablet there are too many clicks involved in changing color and/or tool, when you consider the amount of unutilized real estate in the top part of the screen in landscape mode. Would like separate direct access buttons for the different tools and recently used colors in the top of the screen. - Google Drive sync - Importing specific pages of PDF - Basic shape recognition/conversion - Would like a toolbar in the side where you can save a couple of shapes/etc for reuse thought the note. E.g. if I'm drawing a circuit it would be nice to save a couple of gates in a side toolbar for reuse. - Adjustable smoothening. Some minor smoothening would makes most of my notes look prettier :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for our application. Marking up pdf plans to show works done."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE THIS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I REALLY wish I could synchronize all my notes on the cloud, so that I could access anywhere and they would be safely stored. For me it's priority and it's not cool this app doesn't have this basic feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can't write outside of the pdf with stylus. It would be nice to utilize all the extra space"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Realy bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking notes. Also works well with S-pen and provides all the essential layouts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would've gave it 5 stars except that its missing text selection and copying which I find it pretty basic for a PDF reading and noting app and also very necessary and also if it saves the files automatically on the local drive the syncing is not working properly that been said the app is user friendly especially when u erase stuff using finger which I find it pretty thoughtful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent !!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Says it's free until ypu download it and they want 5 bucks to use it, and i dont even know how well it works.  Edit: after recieving your email about my review, I asked an office buddy who paid for your product. He said it's just as good as some of the free products on Google Play that were free but he considered it a learning point to not do it again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly on my Samsung Chromebook. Doesn't automatically sync to cloud, which is a feature I was looking for in terms of privacy. Overall the best note taking app I've used for Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most responsive note taking app ever. Using an spen, it has almost no lag, which feels amazing and is very important for fluid hand writing, sure the lines are sligtly jagged, and less processed compared to one note or something but its much faster and feels way better - I can actually use my spen on my device now!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but missing a few things that would make it perfect for drawing and note taking. First is a rotate feature for objects/text written and drawn. Kinda essential to a note taking app in my opinion. The second is a magnifying/grouping feature that gives a more natural feel to handwriting for people who write big like myself. This one isnt as important because I know it's more of a personal issue but would still be awesome if somehow implemented. Other than those missing features, it's a great app that I use almost daily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the ChromeOS support! A wonderful tool for marking up papers with the stylus on my Google Pixelbook!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works without fault.  However should sync notes to Google drive account!!!  Please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for note taking"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love to use it. User friendly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As far as operational smoothness goes, it is phenomenal. I give it 5 stars cuz it's truly done well. Im grateful for the effort put into it. The zoom u can do and the ease of use is awesome. HOWEVER, developers, it's been a very long time already since u first came out, it's time u add these feature already: Please, augment the pen selection - now there is only 1 pen style. Most every other similar app has that. The color match feature is so critical that you're missing. The writing needs to be smoother as well. Right now it is very choppy, perhaps because it is vector based. Also, subfolder/directory ability, to be able to organize better.   02/14/18  Update I think it's time you integrate these critical things I've asked for for months. We're paying for this app you know, and I can't remember when you had the last meaningful upgraded. I still think it's a great app but next time I write a review I'm am going to give this app a 2-star rating and will definitely stop paying for it if there is no improvement as there are other apps out there now compete very well with this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app, super helpful for note taking, the only reason I don't give it 5 star rating is because as for now I don't like the font that they use for the adding text tool wish they let you change it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Integrates amazingly naturally with Samsung pens. Is nearly identical experience to writing. Has finally broken through the barrier, and is superior to taking notes on paper. Have completely transitioned over, and look forward to never losing notes nor conversation threads again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I was a little skeptical when first trying it, however I needed an alternative to OneNote for Android (which is aweful). My favorite feature of this app is either the ability to import PDFs or the exporting feature (which works flawlessly). There are a few things that I would like to see in this app. 1) more brushes such as a pencil. 2) password protected notes. And 3) s pen tilt sensitivity (e.i. when the pencil is tilted make the stroke wider and fainter)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried several note taking APPS. this is the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Downloaded 10 or so note taking apps for my Note 8. This is the cream of the crop. I've opted to pay the $1 monthly to improve things even more and to support the app and hopefully it'll get even better! There are a bunch of options for backgrounds and pens, and highlighters. I also like how the notes are saved and accessed. It's easy to organize everything.  When on phone calls that I need to take note of the date auto populates and I can place on speaker and open a note and jot down everything I need.  Truly enjoy this app, it's my most used. It's also one I recommend if anyone sees me using it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I paid for this app. Its working beautiful with my Samsung TAB S3.  Features i like most in this app are: 1. Best palm rejection with saperate pen and finger mode. 2. All variety of colors are available. 3. Simple app environment. 4. Most important pattern of pages  are available.(after purchase) 5. Fix zoom with adjustable ratio. (most helpful)  After using this app, i think these features make its even more better: 1. Color fill tool within closed boundaries. 2. More shapes like. ( hexagon, Pentagon, all direction arrow) 3. Table feature with column and row. 4. Add video file with supportive extension. (it can make notes more alive)  Finding some bugs like: 1. When i do zoom in, i could not write on exact location, mean that if i try to write after zoom in, stroke is delievered at different place.  2. Every time zoom in and out working with slight delay which is annoying.  Overall experience is best. Thank you Squid. 😀"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good pdf editor I just wish the pen and erasers weren't under the same tool. I go back and forth between these two tools, so it's annoying to have access the drop down menu to select the previous tool.  Please, just make the eraser accessible as its own tool right next to the pen instead of having to turn the pen into the eraser. This adds an extra command every time which adds up when you are marking up pdf for hours. Had to go with a different editor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app! I use this every day on my samsung chromebook plus, and note8. works seamlessly with both s pens and allows to write over top pdfs easily (premium, cheap) I am thrilled tom see what new featurs could be offered in future. developers respond to questions quickly and are very helpful! Im thrilled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this on a lenova yoga book. I'm a huge fan of traditional pen and paper. This has been the closest thing to using traditional with the benefits of digital."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"You have to pay extra for cloud backup! I lost all my notes in a jiffy! Now have to coughup 200rs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has everything I need. Tried several apps before finding this one. Easy to use UI, can draw on images, easily rearrange images and drawings, and many options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love how it lets me take notes. When they add support to rotate pdf pages in premium, I'll up it to 5 stars!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app...just wish it had the ability to convert script/handwriting to text.  Would make searching easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great app for note taking especially if your notes are in pdf. $10 a year is more than fair for the level of organization this app allows. Handwriting looks a little off but that is my only complaint."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for handwriting.  It would be cooler if you type text too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Asking for money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"They shouldnt make this a free app because you cant do anything until you pay  for the premium version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When I zoom into my ink, it is very crank and not precise!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow this is an underrated app. Perfect app for S Pen, I'd say it's even better than its main competitor, especially in terms of editing PDF. This app made it light and easy. I'm loving this. Keep it up! -- Can I request theme tho? Would be nice if subscribed users could change theme"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best writing app Needs rotate option  Needs more vector graphics feautures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the tools and the ability to import PDFs for markup.  Also great for planning."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using this on my Samsung Chromebook Plus, and the effective 0 latency is wonderful. I love writing out my thoughts, meeting notes, etc. on paper - something about typing just makes me forget everything and doesn't have the same weight. This app lets me use the method most useful to my learning style while not killing any trees. Highly recommended!   Also has a ""Notebooks"" organizational tab, so no worries on having a bunch of random notes strewn around."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need improvement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I liked trying this app out a lot. It worked very well with my Samsung Chromebook Pro as an Android app. My handwriting wasn't what I hoped it would be, and I struggle with the keyboard on the back of the Pro, but I think it would improve with use of the app. Unfortunately, the author wants a monthly ongoing fee for the app, or you use the ""basic"" edition. This would be a great $4 or even $5 app - but they want $1/mo or $10/year. In its basic form, there are other great apps that do as well, if not better, and are also free. The free version is fine, but again, so are others that have features this one charges for. (You can pay to upgrade individual add ons like PDF import and eraser tools, but that is more than the app is worth.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish it had Google Drive backup so I can keep the same notes on my Chromebook and my phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still the best available natural handwriting app for Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for the app already, and more than many other apps cost,  and now I am supposed to pony up $3 more just to be able to save my notes to the cloud? And a subscription fee? I used to use Evernote and see where this is going.  No thanks. Update: seems I was right. Now requires a subscription to save to the cloud (my own cloud)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Unfortunately writing in pop up view on a Galaxy Note 8 is buggy...I made the developer aware of this issue and he had promised to look into a fix!  Fingers crossed!                                                    Excellent app for some good brain maps.  I would love to see the Dev add native Chromecast support too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with my Pixelbook + Pixelpen. 100% approve for college note taking!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I had this app pre-installed on my Nvdia shield(cannot uninstall). I was interested in trying this out only to find there's no trial for the PDF importing. I could subscribe or buy the add on but it's the fault of the Devs and Nvidia for preloading an app without being able to try out the functionality before purchasing. 3 stars for a cool app with a user hostile business model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works nicely."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"We need to sort our files. We want to create folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not perfect, but easily the best option within either chromeos or android for taking notes.  I entrust squid with my postgraduate education."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good for note taking, but lacks tools for drawing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing for note taking.  I use it for all of my hand written notes, annotating texts (I download PDFs and can mark all over them!) and solving algebraic equations.  Thanks Squid for an amazing note taking experience!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well. Love being able to see my hand written Notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is excellent on the  Pixelbook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Boleh"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best note taking app for school! Only things I'd love is google drive cloud backup and convert to text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for hand written notes, I use it for all my classes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for what I need it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it everyday this week replacing my paper notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has revolutionized how I teach. I have a rubric open, make my comments, upload to Dropbox and then clean off the comments with my finger and start again. It is honestly amazing. Teachers who see what I'm doing on my Galaxy Tablet in conjunction with this app are green with envy and are in shock!! Best app out there. I test 60 kids every week, for 14 weeks. This has saved me so much time and paper it's unbelievable!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have almost entirely replaced pen and paper using this app on my Chromebook, the one exception being post its. wicked good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used a lot of note taking apps and this is the best because of all the page sized note sizes, with all the time of ""paper"" templates and import pdfs is so easy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A really cool app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"in-app purchases extended even to things shown in the basic tutorial and tools i downloaded the app for. need to buy expansion to use text input"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for what I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This would be my go-to note taking app but for one flaw: no word wrap. Pasting text is a nightmare as words run off past the margins. Samsung Note and Ever Note word wrap perfectly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for notes and studying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"hard locks the  Google  pixelbook  on occasion, but overall a good note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Monthly payment just for importing pdf. Stupid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for notes & signing PDF documents without having to use a printer!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Look for reasons to handwrite notes. Perfect for filling out non-fillable pdf's. Suggestion: native sync across devices. I dont use drop box or box. Add support for google drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've never liked and enjoyed taking notes as much as I do now!! It is pretty easy and it has lot of choices. The downloading via dropbox is very easy. ABSULOTLY RECOMENDED!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just great for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly.  Love the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has all the best of writing by hand, but with so much more! I love using it to reorganize and format my notes. The best part is how it supports a Samsung stylus which features an erasor along with a selector button.  This app doesn't have all the fancy syncing features other apps do, but it has all the core features other apps are sadly lacking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Over all great app. Would like to syncing between multiple devices and hand writing recognition. That would move it to a five."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far best note taking and PDF annotating app for Android!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works pretty good, better than google keep, Allthough it did freeze a couple of times on my pixelbook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"bait and switch, says notate on pdf and cannot do so without fee"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"5 dollars to import a PDF is pretty crazy for a ""free"" app. Definitely not worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"a+"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still the best. I bought Premium version a long time ago and it was best money ever spent. The only thing this amazing app is missing is a big widget showing the latest current note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best in the  world"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It has the best handwriting and pdf support of any app I have tried so far, but the slow load times when scrolling make using it a chore. I would rather deal with harder to use programs that require lengthy setups but then work properly once I begin writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best handwriting app on the market. Period."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think this is a good app thanks to the inventor"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I keep coming back to Squid but a better tool bar and dark theme thats eassier on thee eyes would make this app perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to make math videos and I love it. The ink speed is the reason I downloaded the app. I purchased the annual subscription so I could upload PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add handwriting recognition"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic for note taking, planning, etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish I could give 4.5... great for now taking, however I wish I didn't have to go to a different app to type notes. If you could integrate a basic type box for when hand writing just doesn't cut it,  it would be great.  And maybe flow chart tools????"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I started by using the free version on my pixelbook and really enjoyed using. The free version is perfect especially if you just want a note pad. I decided to buy the full version because I decided I wanted to start using at as a full replacement for paper notebooks. This is a great app for students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app on my new Chrombook Pixel with the pen and it has been a dream. Very easy to uplaod lecture slides and take notes directly on the slides or to use the lined ""paper"" and take my own notes. The highlighting feature is very nice. Overall I have had no problems with the app and it has been an awesome tool for juggling multiple different college courses"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for college student..... I have the galaxy tab s3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a few apps. This one is by far the easiest to use and free version has all the features I wanted."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely perfect UI. If you'd asked me what exact UX I wanted from a simple note-taking app I couldn't have told you before using this. Great job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice for taking handwritten notes. Doesn't have cloud sync with Google drive which is  unfortunate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is making easy to put down the and paper when taking notes in meetings.   One suggestion would be to offer alternate views for the list of notes,  like a list view with no preview.  Otherwise this is great.  I would love to see this available on Windows.  I just got a Lenovo 920 with pen, and would like to be able to use it in the same was as I have used my Android devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is almost a great app with a few frustrating flaws. First, its really great to have an app that allows you to draw and ""paint"" right over PDF's. I use this for marking up landscape drawings with edits for the drafting team. I also use it for responding to questions from contractors. In this, it works well - it's very well synced with dropbox, Google Drive, and any other way you like to share. A few simple problems, however, are VERY frustrating. 1. From my experience and research, you cannot erase part of highlighted areas (which I used frequently). It is an all or nothing delete. 2.  With no confirmation for closing a file, I sometimes bump the back button and the file closes. Auto saving keeps me from losing the file, but I also lose the option for undoing. Not huge, but definitely frustrating. Add a confirmation screen for exiting and the problem is gone. More to come..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for active styluses with quick responses"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"What a scam! Forced to purchase the ""premium"" version upon opening."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice note apps with lots of template and functionality to work with general purpose notetaking, academic, or even drawing. Still, the only issue I have right now is when scrolling in a zomed in page or infinite size page. It takes time to render the new section page and you can't directly see the new section as you need to wait until the page to stop moving. I will give 5 star if the scrolling  in a page is as smooth as OneNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"By far the most versatile note app... & I've tried just about all.  Only needs widget, and an attractive pen like calligraphy.  Then it would be perfect. A first page clickable index would make it even better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs Google drive support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I liked it when I was going through the tutorial, but after that I clicked the true eraser tool and it said I have to get the premium. No. Just no. Other than this it is a good app to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I bought the premium version so I could markup pdf files on my chromebook. It doesn't support chromebook. Google is usually goof at refunding for situations like this. Yea Google boo squid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"(Update) Subscribed to Squid even though I ""already paid"" yrs ago. I care that much about keeping this app and developer in business!  I've been using Squid for over 5 yrs in my business and could not function without it.  Better than SNote, and better than all the other note taking apps by far (purchased many). Squid is in a class by itself when it comes to hand-written notes, docs to pdf, and even graphics (yes graphics - think workarounds). Squid is fast and super functional in a work environment. It's just better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and very effective if you want a simple program to take meeting notes. Inise onenote for heavy project tracking, but use squid as my go to note pad."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Vector based but no SVG export options. Without subscription upgrade, and without a proper stylus, functionality is too limited to offer any advantage over free alternatives like Keep and OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since you guys updated your app to better support Chromebooks, I am giving you 5 stars now!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Unbelievable!!! Thank you so very much!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its awosome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Tried virtually every handwriting app for Android and this was the only serious and usable app. The only issue is the lack of options for changing the relationship between pressure and line thickness. The implementation seems to be a naive linear approach which results in too wide a range in thicknesses."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It was great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My son uses this to do art and loves it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app to use with stylus (Galaxy Note 10.1). Upd: works nice on Galaxy Tab s3 as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great nite taking app. Best on market. You can select text and move or copy  recolor. Erase is great, only wish the erase square could be size customized for when zoomed in. Moving and panning or extending the size of paper is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add more pen types  like lead pencils, fountain  pens, calligraphic pen etc so far so great note taking app on play store."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very flexible and easy to use note taking app. Very good for handwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a good app but I'd like to see tap/swipe to flip page in read-only mode."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yesssss"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best note-taking apps out there for Chromebook, works great and latency is very low on my Samsung Chromebook Pro. One thing that would be nice to see is being able to import pictures from the app instead of having to press annotate image on the screenshot notification"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Clearly an app after my own heart, this feels like the way it should be done as far as handwritten notes go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved it.....it helped me arrange my day......"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good quick Note With endless Paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful like natural paper. Keep going."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Ready to use but requires a very very expensive monthly fee to use all of its features. If it were a one time fee for maybe $5 or so, then I'd buy it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on Samsung Chromebook Plus! I use it for all of my meeting notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The text just keeps going on the same line forever. It doesn't break the lines, so there's no way you can see all of it without scrolling on and on to the right. Even if I change the page size. I would absolutely love the app if it broke the lines to show it all on one page. I just wasted three bucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Writing with your finger is never as pretty as the samples, but it works at all zoom levels. Erasing is easy and intuitive. I have a Samsung Galaxy J7V (low end galaxy from Verizon) and it works pretty well. I tried a bunch and this is best. It does use more battery than internet, but less than gaming, so there's that. Totally recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great but still no google one drive back up?? Now does not upload to one drive so utterly pointless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Praise the sun!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really like the app but its a start up when phone starts app and runs in background hmm"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Some tools only available on paid version. Better look somewhere else"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app is amazing for those who want an iPad pros pen functionality on the cheap (a touchscreen ASUS Chromebook flip does the job)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like that I can use my stylus to highlight papers. Also its great that I  can write notes in the margins or separately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Saw all the great reviews and thought this might be a great app. Unfortunately I did not have the chance to find out because  Importing PDFSs would actually cost $4.95"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After download, it forces u to buy the premium. You can't open a single file without buying. Waste app and misguiding people to download.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"search function please!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"squid means stupid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very good product"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"EXTREMELY responsive to stylus on Chromebook Plus. Were this app to have automatic backup to the Cloud, it would be absolutely essential."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish it had reminders and subfolders. Would also like an integrated calculator and reminders capability.  While you're at it, add flashcards as well. I love the page templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does not fit LG Stylo 2 handwriting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fun"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very good app, simple to use with a clean interface. I originally gave it a 5 star review but I haven't  seen much development of it in the past year. It only has 3 available shapes (line, rectangle and oval),  and you cannot select a non-rectangular area either. I wish you could save shortcuts to pen types and shapes commonly used (with the color and line width combination), instead you need to change each property separately, which makes it a lot less efficient to take notes than other apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I honestly love this app, writing is great and its so easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app for everyone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awsome app, use it daily for construction survey's, highly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Woo! Just Wooooo! I don't ever need pen and paper again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It works very well, and it's free unless I need additional tools. But once you want that,  it requires huge cost. Monthly subscription? No thanks. Way too greedy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beautiful. Just beautiful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Think this is the best note taking app for Android. Just like writing on paper. Would be great if there were a version for Windows, or if notes could be exported in other formats such as Microsoft OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Good work on it. Helpful in making notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Okay so I do love this app &think it's great, my reason for Only giving 4 Stars: 1. It would be great to have more than one pen type 2. It would be really useful if you could save your notes using one device& be able to open on another. 3. Is there a way to print things direct from the app or share Particular notes via email etc? (I haven't been using the app long so Maybe just that I haven't found this feature? 4. My main reason I guess, The price. Why does it have to be a Subscription? Why can't it just be a one off payment? Unless ofcourse It's About making as much money as possible? Personally Apps that require a Subscription put me off. Iwould much prefer a one off Payment.  Please consider adding extra features &The payment method. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for productivity and document markup!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It will be a perfect tool if there's unlimited space to mark up pdf!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good One for my little son"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even includes manuscript template!! top notch app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far loving it. Writing instead of typing really makes a nice change and more likely to get stuff done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid is a solid little tool for getting the most out of your touchscreen. While I'd love the ability to create your own templates (a digital lesson plan template, for example!) and would love to see better functionality re: ways to save/share (direct to email or Hangouts vs. just Skype or to a device), it's does what I need and makes note-taking during boring meetings tolerable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent writing experience!! Need custom page templates  and ink to text conversion"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Changed the way I do pretty much everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Cannot open 200MB size files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's quite compatible with my Chromebook plus, I just wish there was finger touch page flipping instead of pushing a button. Nice stylus sensitivity though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Based on the name it makes you think you can write on PDFs, but that's locked behind a paywall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's very bad. I hated it. You have to buy premium to use most basic things other apps do got free. It is good app as long as you pay for specials"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, Really like the autosave function. Worth paying for subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please approve. When i need to type on the paper. It is not easy to set the line up. Please do not make the pop up for type. Just give us to type on paper directly. The othe is very good for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great, I love using it to draw things like hamsters and stuff. Just wish you didn't play to pay all the time 4 the extra tools"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Notes aren't very visually organized. I wish there was color coded notebooks and put as the home or default screen rather than recent notes or all notes page. I have so many singled notes there is no way I can efficiently look through the all notes tab to find what I want so to me that tab it's a pointless and stressing thing to look at"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really? You are charging that much for such a simple note taking tool?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No multi-device sync. No direct Google Drive backup option. (Box and Dropbox native support only... Really?) Palm recognition is abysmal. Has a Pen only mode you'll have to use to avoid screwing up drawings so it's at least got that over OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for note taking. Easy organization along with the ability to import a pdf. It is also easy to have automatic backups that can be opened on other devices.  A link to upload to one drive along with more tools would make this app awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth paying for the upgraded version.  It's incredible,  I use everyday"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Have to upgrade just to get a hilighter. Nope. No layers. Nope. No selection of images after insertion. Nope. Pass... S Note and OneNote work just fine for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this on my galaxy note and it world like magic.  I like how you can buy the set of features you actually need individually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Had to read through all the more info to get to the premium section to see that you have to pay to markup PDFs. Don't advertise that as a key feature in your app if it's only unlockable via in app purchase..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After  paying  for Tools, I am not able  to open any PDF file in SQUID. It is forcing me to me to buy Premium. It does not even allow to open the file"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app Is truley fantastic, I bought the basic tool package and would gladely pay the yearly subscription if only I could choose to save the document in a Png with a clear background, and if I could choose a different eraser shape (Round). I cant wait to see the further development of this app and hope my suggestions were helpful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best S-pen note app I've found.  Free to start, and you can buy additional features if you like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. Use it all the time, i'd give it 5 stars but the color of the app is ugly. We should be able to change the theme of the app. Picky yes but appearance does count.   I still love still app and still waiting on a color change! Please? I'm begging for color option for this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Low stylus latency, infinite canvas. Amazing handwritten notes taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic. It has multiple paper templates, excellent palm rejection if you have a stylus, and importing PDFs is a breeze with the premium subscription.   Worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app for the Pixelbook. Works great with the Pixelbook pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Practical application to take notes and share"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I am using it for all notes and lists"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Decent app. My only complaint would be that you can not create your own backgrounds. For teaching, it would be great if I could set lesson plan templates as my background."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Actually a paid app, don't get pranked"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much faster than snotes.  Great organization.  Love infinite screen.  Works great with stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a great note taking app, I love it. there is no lag with the stylus and this app is fantastic for taking notes on PDFs and making easy fliers and stuff. its great however, I have 3 major issues with it.  1. it is super annoying that i cant edit text that i type in after it is set.  2. i can only have this stuff on one device, which is super annoying as well, i want to be able to open all my notes and edit them on my phone and my chromebook. 3. Also, why cant i back it up with google drive? thats stupid please allow google drive back ups.  regardless of these issues, i use this app every day for notes in class, i really love it. these issue obviously arent a deal breaker. however if these issues could be fixed that would be excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's not perfect, but one of the best, that's why I bought the Premium Version!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect for editing PDF files. One problem though, is that you cannot swipe through pages of a file using your fingers; you need to use the arrows at the top of the screen. I hope this gets better and more approachable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app was exactly what I was looking for to be able to annotate my professors` lecture notes and it works very intuitively. I am very satisfied."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No manual save"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You can't even type notes without paying 10 bucks a year for premium. Wow."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This could have been a good apps 12.27€ for having function of the apps is clearly a joke.then they'll add new function, and pay some more.look a lot like a demo, disappointing and ludicrous...the additional tool for text who have been stripped would be there by default"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing and totally worth paying for. I would love to get more different pens. Good job devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is very useful for writing things down, but some of it is not easy to figure out-I am still just using its basic note-taking feature as I have no idea how to use the rest of these supposed options"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to pay for PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome, very handy with note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really well done app for note taking. It'd be awesome if there was an easy way to have a few present pen setups (size, opacity, colour...) to allow for faster switching. But even without that hands down the best note taking app on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great in most respects, needs gesture based page changes especially for imported PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for drawing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I always use squid to take notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just let me pay for premium once, the subscription model is nonsense when I only need to features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I pay for the features when it was papyrus, pay for the subscription when it's now squid. It's not really worth the cost unless you take a lot of notes or do a lot of pdf edits."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great. Near-perfect virtual notepad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easily the best android note-taking app, especially on the Chromebook Pixelbook. OneNote is technically better, when on a device that it's optimized for -- but the Pixelbook is not one of those devices, yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works with the Samsung Pen; great e-paper choices; easy to  backup your e-notebooks; awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Import and markup PDF?  Only after in app purchase for $6.49"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very handy and convenient app for lecturing, note taking. Love the feature that you can use your finger to erase right away (while you are using s pen) instead of having to tab a few buttons to complete the task. It'd be great if i could embed a web link and create video icon when pasting youtube link that i could just tab snd heading to web browser right away."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"best writing experience for simple note taking out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"this app is pretty good. would be better with a night mode and full scren mode..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has made my work much easier.  I have almost stopped printing anything. .....anyone want a laser printer?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome App for taking notes directly on a powerpoint .pdf. My professor lectures a million miles an hour so this has been a savior! Also, there are tons of awesome layouts to help organize or personalize anything! Would only suggest a little more ability to organize folders & how things are put in them. Maybe a ""folder within a folder"" feature to separate different aspects of the subject."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ausgezeichnet!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love it can't wait for more features!   I can't seem to take a screenshot and paste in the document is this a future feature? :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using with my new Pixelbook.  It's certainly the best app available, but not perfect.  The tools in the UI should be quicker to access and get rid of the drop down menu.  The drop down adds significantly more time to switching tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my default memory. Being able to insert photos and use cut and paste is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best writing and organising notes and such for school for Android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for the S-pen. Allows you to completely ignore touch. Vector based with smooth inking. Keeps things simple. Missing sync. That is my only complaint."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hands down the best writing and note taking app that I have come across on android. Use it with active pen on Samsung note tablet and it works great for my daily lecture and homework needs as a college student. Only thing missing is the ability to type. Otherwise, nearly perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for all my school puposes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for all of my homework, and its awsome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Can't import PDF unless you buy full version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very Good and easy app . Would be perfect if could open app on Pen removal .for note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"After trying a fair bit of stylus compatible apps, this one is by far my favorite. Works great, has pressure sensitivity and many options for inputs. My biggest complaint is panning the notes is very slow and only loads the new parts after panning stops. Incredibly annoying and  unproductive when you want to read a note or search something fast. If that is fixed, 5 stars for sure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I feel like I'm actually writing on paper, but I get all the convenience of working digitally. I tried a lot of other programs before Squid, and I didn't have any of the glitchy saving problems with Squid that I had with others. It's free. It works. I do everything on it, from my lesson plans to my journal. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lowest latency of any notetaking app on a Pixelbook. Feels noticeably faster than Google Keep."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"After trying all the top rated note taking apps with stylus support, this is my favorite. Superb touch accuracy and the great user interface. It's lacking some little features here and there, but makes up for it with excellent execution of the ones it has."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app that I use for all my school work. I convert the PPT to pdf and then edit them on the app. The handwriting part, which I use almost all the time, is perfect. My only complaint is I wish entering text was similar to onenote where after you type you can adjust the text box to fit how you would like. Often times I have to go back and press enter in the text or else the words will run off the page. For this reason I gave it 4 stars instead of5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Super app I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is perfect writing app ever I made a stylus for my self , take pen roll a foil paper over it then your stylus is ready this app is perfect ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note-taking app for hand writers I've yet found for Android.  It really shines with my Samsung Chromebook Pro using the S-Pen.  A really nice feature is the ability to import a pdf, sign it with my S-Pen, and export it as a flattened version suitable for sharing.  No more need for those silly signing apps, none of which ever did that great of a job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing note app. Works so well with note 8. Must have the college students with note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"it make my note forever strore... Thank you so much..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Hilight tool on pdf file should auto correct to fit the text like goodnote on iOS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bad bug. Couldn't even get started. When I try to open a pdf, a window pops up asking if I want to use a stylus and before I can say yes, the box disappears and app closes. And they charged me $1 for this disappointment!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent as a blank paper or whiteboard alternative"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easiest painting, drawing and working out math equations ever!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Expensive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think it can be the best application for drawing and writing if developer can little changes in it..the biggest drawback in this application is whenever I change colour of pen or switch between pen and eraser it shows every time dialogue box which is really really very irritating for me I think it should be just like page insert tab ...and one more thing if possible please add full screen mode for drawing with hidden tools but active...so please kindly make these changes I would give it 5 star and start loving it thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"ITS almost paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love squid because it helps me a lot. And i can make my coaching or institute notes easily and everywhere but the app still needs some updated   Tools ,😃"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, no lag with this app using the S pen in my Samsung Chromebook Pro"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for classes. Once, I deleted my files on my tab but I saved it on Squid and still had my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app on Android, but still not as good as NoteTaker HD on iPad Great, clean interface, but it would be great to have a double pane view, where we can be zoomed in on the section that we are writing, while still being able to see the rest of the page on a second pane."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! Very simple and direct to use. Wins over all other not taking apps I've tried due to its simple and clean UI.  This app needs proper milti-device sync though. Nobody is on one device only anymore.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple, easy to use, and intuitive. great for a college students such as myself"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple and practice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Cool features like shape and text are not free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome sauce"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Its OK. But is a bit buggy on note 2014 10.1. Would be nice to have an svg export feature that mirrors directory structure within squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well for college notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have a tab s2 and I am not able to open the app. Crashed every time I open it. Please help. I really like this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very powerful tool. A tablet is incomplete and ineffective  without  it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note taking on my Samsung galaxy tab s3, very much satisfied with its performance,, there is no latency , it's very smooth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have the paid version, it helps me a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's quite great, I Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great app that allows gou to tale notes like the real one. With unlimited page number and without using any single ink or eraser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a paraprofessional at the high school level. I love being able to use this app for work. I am able to help students take notes and send them to teachers. I can take a photo of the worksheet and work along side the students to help them learn. I am able to file them into notebooks and categories that keep them organized. This has been the best app ever!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great improvement on my Chromebook Pro! one of the best apps for note taking out there!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Overall, I really like this app and I use it for a variety of notebooks. The issues that keep this from being perfect for me is the finger eraser feature on pen-enabled devices, as I often end up erasing things just panning (laterally or zoom) about the image, and the lack of a cloud sync that makes my notes accessible (even if not editable) across different platforms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wold like more tools"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Missing small QOL features, but otherwise a solid app. Haven't crashed, can work with pdfs. Basically my paper now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app that works with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the basic functions of this app. I mainly bought the yearly subscription because of the S Pen integration but I find this app could go so much further in user friendly interface and adding Google Drive as a backup source. There's a few things that could be done to make it a 5 star, I think it would be easily acheivable. If you want the full list, just PM me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helpful but I wish that I can have files to sort my notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't use keypad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app I've found for active stylus like the s-pen.  I was also just able to restore my notes from my old busted tablet because I had backed them up to  Dropbox previously. Such a life saver!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When move around in paper notes disappear until stop moving I think it must has a cache memory. its very disappointing problem in this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried several apps for note taking with the stylus.   This is definitely the easiest to use and most effective."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Adaptable note app. Expand and contract pages. Very workable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app. Somehow more responsive and accurate than stock's. Chrombook Pro user btw."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very easily! Perfect to add lecture notes to a pdf file."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I wish I could create a folder within a folder. Other than that, I like it and use it daily for school notes."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"SQUID -- ALMOST PERFECT REPLACEMENT for S-NOTES:  ××××  Squid needs 3 FEATURES to become the best successor to S-NOTES.  1.  Export Squid notes to the S-Notes file format.  2. Import S-Notes &  Samsung Notes into Squid.  3.  Support for One Drive & Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this for school, chromecasting my notes on the smartboard. Great app, writing is superb with my chromebook pro. Could do with better functionality arranging notes, but sinks to GDrive and GClassroom, edits pdfs easily, what's not to like!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for taking notes. Love the wide variety in type of paper . Would love it more if the pen came in different styles too (brush stroke, pencil effect, marker pen effect)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have app for Samsung Note owners. I did not like the new S Note app so I tried several apps and Squid beats them all. Thanks to the team behind this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Works for taking notes, but I found there were too little functions available. Also,I'm not going to pay for the premium version to be able to take notes on PDFs, it should be possible to try this function out before paying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great notes taking tool. Just don't expect a lot of updates"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best , but please add full screen mod. . Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"We need pen stabilization!  The update was really nice, I do appreciate the material design. I love that it works with my S-pen. I would love for you guys to add a tagging system, some things just don't belong to only one notebook and that would be so helpful! I love the ability to export my notes and download pdfs, it comes in handy much more than I thought it would. I'm subscribed to premium after already buying everything else. I just want more pens guys.  A fountain and Calligraphy pen would be nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the most fully-featured-yet-clean 'e-paper' app that I have used. It's very intuitive and user-friendly. The only thing that would make it better is integration with handwriting-to-text recognition! Great job, devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You have to pay to can text so dumn!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No Google drive sync. No ability to write on a magnified pane separate from the slide.  Needs to be more like Notability"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Obviously you don't need anything else, this is what I wanted"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"When you dont have pen and paper around, this app is invaluable. Its also nice to jot things down from the net. And keep one from having to get up and find a pen. One of the best apps I've used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add feature to eliminate margins. It is very annoying each time to zoom manually to the text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For Galaxy Note this app is just superb!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Full of nice features. Backup/restore helps a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app for s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Actually a good app, especially with S pen - but it doesn't support printing. Huge downside for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Overall, the best Android hand writing notebook app. I would love to see some features added (erasable highlighting, easier page turning, multiple pen memory), but this app still beats out the competitors for both aesthetic and functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I would be able to draw texts it does not allow if you have a app that does that I will take it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it! But want to have preset pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a very good and useful app. It makes PDF annotations and hand written notes and letters simpler. A app I will described as fantastic! Loved it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Free app does nothing. Only download if you want to upgrade to premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for making  college note taking and organization so much easier for me. I would absolutely recommend this for any one with a Samsung S-pen or Chromebook plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been wanting an app on my new computer and I finaly found one I like I mean love thanks!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It's not free to edit in pdf! That's why I installed it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall this app is working great for me. Would love the option to upload our own backgrounds - then you'd have my 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works awesome with an Nvidia shield tablet combined with a Adonit jot pro with pixel point. Pressure sensitivity works without having to pair the device via Bluetooth. Only turn on the stylus and you have pressure sensitivity enabled :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I bought a subscription to exit pdfs but it won't  even open them, just got a message saying ""unsupported file type""."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a very nice app, but the company does not have the power to improve it in the same pace as users needs. I very important feature, sync with cloud/multiple devices, does not exist for long time. I really hope that company grows up because if not, I ll need to change do S-Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than S Notes or Onenote for me.   Greater functionality and customization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the reasons I am still on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is quite possibly the best ""note-taking"" app I've ever used.. but it's so much more than that.   It's a very powerful vector drawing tool, with an extremely simple but powerful interface. If you have some text you've hand-written, you can then go and select parts of it, then change the size, or the color, or the brush stroke thickness, or even duplicate it several times then slightly modify each one, rather than having to write something from scratch several times.   And since it's vector-based rather than rasterised, there's no quality loss to writing/drawing something at one size, and then later resizing it, or dragging it around the place, etc. <3  Basically, it's a really fantastic app. I'm very happy that I stumbled upon it however many years ago when I first got a tablet with a built-in stylus, and it has served me well ever since.    Probably the one feature that it's """"""missing"""""" (and I say that in the sense that I have absolutely no expectation of it being a feature) would be being able to choose custom typefaces / write with a monospaced font (and beyond that, being able to write syntax-highlighted code....) -- it's a very specific use-case :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for Math notes only thing to make it better would be to add audio recording while writing but still great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love using this for highlighting passages in journal articles while working on my masters program classes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is a blessing if you have a laptop or tablet with a pen to write with. I use the Samsung Chromebook Plus and it has replaced every notebook I have. The only gripes I have with the app is that I wish I could use it like Microsoft Word when I have more lecture style classes (I use Evernote for those) and I wish there were some more organizational tool. Other than that I can't recommend this app enough. If Evernote and Squid had a baby it would be perfect. (Also its great for doodling, add some more art tools if you can!!!)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful to my academics. Great note taking app. The tool kit was a worthy investment since I draw a lot of pictures during scratch work and meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for all of my classes. Very handy. I wish i could backup and view via desktop but it works either way. Best purchase I've made from the app store."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall I am loving this app. I mostly use it on a Chromebook Plus, and out of all the apps for usage with an active stylus, this by far works the absolute best. The reason for only 4 stars is that there are a few items it's lacking on. While integration with Google Drive would be nice, the bigger issue I find is that there is no option for syncing across multiple devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I used to love Squid and use it all the time. I subscribed so I could choose other backgrounds for my studying notes. However, since I've paid for it, adding pictures became much more difficult, as it crashes and warns me documents has stopped... I haven't had any problems with the free version. Is there a solution for me?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Well,  tried it again 3 years later... some improvements,  but still,  I want to see a Zoomed writing window, so that I can write large and neatly with stylus... and still have normal notebook view/feel when page is zoomed out. And to make matters worse,  now subscription for pro features... uninstalled quicker than last time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful notetaking platform - works great on my Samsung Chromebook Pro for annotating my digital textbook and taking notes during class.  I would like to see Google Drive offered as a cloud backup option in future releases as well as the ability to seach PDF files."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect paper and pen :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to understand interface, unlimited paper size is great but: You can't rotate a selected set of lines - you can only resize. After resizing, the undo button won't undo the resize. I then tried to exit without saving to get around this bug but that's not an option. I drew a complicated shape but messed up a tiny amount at the end - the awkwardly square-shaped eraser would only delete the entire shape (unless you pay) so you have to draw it from scratch or just leave the error in there. There's also only"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"elegant allow u to write infinite endless note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good notes taking with my Samsung tab s3 !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very lightweight and responsive.  Responses to stylus pressure, which makes writing a lot more natural"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ideal for furiously scribbling notes on provided lecture slides (on pdf) in grad school.  This app is helping me stay ahead of my classmates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for note taking. i do all my notes and homework on this app. this app work perfectly with my chromebook, definitely recommend it for college students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On a Note device, any drawing app must measure up to S Note. Squid has infinity scroll, but less tools - this is worth money, but no subscription (hello?!)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I draw diagrams frequently for blog posts and to include in training materials, and Squid helps me work both on my phone and my tablet. I love the drawing interface, particularly the ease with which I can zoom into an area to draw smaller, more detailed things."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's saying 504 error and can not install. Any solution for this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pain in the butt to import pics."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app with an awesome writing experience. However Text Mode does not have autocorrect, and there's a lot of lag when dealing with PDFs that have many images."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"垃圾"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's good, but they really should add a full screen mode for the PDF files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good productivity app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I like this app but I have to give it two stars because it can only import .PDFs, wish it could import .PPT(X) and images. Also when I download a .PDF to the folder on my chromebook, the app can take up to 30 minutes before the PDF is available in the Squid file browser even though I can view it in the native file explorer and even 3rd party file explorers. This is very inconvenient in classes when I need to quickly convert a .PPT to a .PDF and I can't even work on my notes for class."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, user-friendly, does what it was meant to do with a few extra features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome functionality, just wish some of the more useful features weren't behind a paywall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for adding images to PDF files. I have personalized many brochures to send to customers with my business card attached on the document"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for the Samsung Chromebook Plus, and other similar Chromebooks. Really excellent note-taking tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for notes and marking up files, very fast and convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still learning how to use it.  Easy to use so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"First good app for editing PDFs I've come across."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"love this for my lettering, but I am so disappointed that I can't zoom in on my drawings anymore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app because I'm always taking notes during class or doing homework, and It works great with the s pen. However I would like some features added. The first feature would be to have folders within the note books. For example have a circuits note book and some folders in there, one for class notes, one for homework, and one for practice. This would greatly enhance the app and would definitely make it 5/5.  Another feature that I would love to see is to have a ""night mode"" where the background is black and the lines in the paper white so it's easier to write and not shed too much light in the room if it's during a presentation with the lights turned off.  Another feature I would love to see would be top add different backgrounds. Finally I would love to have the option to add pages in a pdf, not just at the end but between pages so I can take more explicit notes.  All this features would make this app be on top for a long time.  However, even without them this app is amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The infinite canvas feature is outstanding."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GooooooD"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am try this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awsome. Next update must be a GIF animation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is great on chromebook!! I just have one suggestion: can u guys add a catalog of pdf so that it can replace my other pdf apps?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I do like the app, but one downfall is the lack of bulk import and export of .PDFs. this is a known topic in the forums and it doesn't appear to me that this is on the list of additions. Not having this feature is a tremendous inconvenience for me because of the multiple journal articles I read on a daily basis; have to import separately... In 2017..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beats S Note anytime. And it keeps improving. Kudos. Update: I'm still using it in 2017!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does almost everything I want it to do!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app and use it for school assignments, there is some things that needs improving though,  like you can't  rotate an object witch is necessary for the work I do. Bought the program and can still not rotate.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Should type directly on worksheet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love everything about it and the pro version!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would give squid 5 stars because it  does serve as an incredible platform to use handwriting on touchscreen devices. However this app could use some minor tweeks to make it comparable to platforms like evernote.  If the creators of squid do not intend to make this app to wholesome, by updating the app to add features such as typing word documents and organizational tools like sub-folders. Squid should expect that users will want to  combine their notes with the other material on a platform that provides these details. The app does allow for exporting or backing up documents using drop-box or box, but there is no easy way to quickly upload to other platforms like onedrive or the google cloud.   This app is great if you're just trying to jot down some stuff on a touchscreen device. However if you intend to use it as your primary tool for school or work, the app needs some help before it can provide as a good platform for all of your work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. One issue I'm having is as a left handed writer I keep hitting the back button when writing at the top of the page. When setting the sheet to letter format it's pretty unavoidable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I find the zoom feature really disappointing.  The paper background gets really blurry and distorted when zoomed in.  I also don't like how i always have to scroll the page myself when zoomed in.  A zoombox feature would be amazing.    For about the same amount of money, I ended up switching to Notability on my sister's old ipad.  Works like a charm."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"My squid has stopped working on my tablet and I paid for all the extras."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use on my Chromebook plus and the pen input and tools are fantastic. Only missing feature is ocr."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice for S Pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it to make notes for my table top RPGs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"If we have to pay for every single fonction/feature on the app just make it a paying app instead of free with in-app purchases."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"ALWAYS have an error that the app quits itself immediately eithout any explaination"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"would have been nice to know that the pdf importing is an in-app purchase"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gave it 5 stars because as of 3.2.2  itˋs  perfect for what I do - taking notes during lectures, importing class notes and marking them up. 3.2.2 introduced the ability for external keyboards to enter a newline in the text tool, so I can switch easily between power touch typing for the bulk of my notes and pen mode for graphs, illustrations and formulae. (I use a combination of the Galaxy Tab 6 and the k780). A fabulous app that I use constantly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I'm very confused about the business model. I got this on the play store. Unlike most apps, this requires a subscription to use different backgrounds, as though that were some great feature. The question is, unlike play store apps, I don't know that my subscription can be used across devices and OS upgrades and changes. I had a subscription at one time, but that disappeared when I reset my phone. What's the problem with using the play store normally, offering an upgrade, and let me use it on my devices. After all, we're just talking about extra backgrounds."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was very much for this app, I even submitted feature ideas and bug reports.  Used it for a long time, but 5 dollars (in app purchase) is too much for me for a still unfinished product.  I switched to Lecture Notes, not as elegant, but has everything which Papyrus still lacks for a little bit less.  I'm still on the lookout for a sale, I will buy Papyrus when it goes down to 2-3 dollars and has more bangs for the buck..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent, I'm a college student and it's wonderful for writing notes on the pdf the professors send via email and it just makes college much more fun and easier. Many great features also."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app. I would love to be able to change the background color to black. Very good for night writing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, simple and useful tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my tablet.  Use it to import the agenda and take minutes on the agenda"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad asks for money only to import your pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does everything I have needed so far ... Be nice if they added a signature feature for the PDF documents ..  Other than that have to say it's perfect for keeping track and editing PDF documents and keeping notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I wanted to make this my noye-taking app instead of using a PDF reader as my primary app. Unfortunately (and contrary to the name and description), it can't do PDFs without paying $1 per month. I can't really justify paying for a recurring fee for an app that doesn't really provide more functionality than what is offered elsewhere. And I can't even try out the off features due to the upfront cash grab"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good in theory but I haven't found a stylus that works with my handset"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gets me through every quarter...easy and effortless. I usually don't pay for apps but this one is definitely going to be a long term relationship."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very handy little app for making and sorting quick notes for shopping lists, memos, reminders ... anything you might use a paper notebook to track."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried a lot of different stylus apps and this one works the best for me. Lots of options, solid performance, and a great interface!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very Nice application, thanks & Regards"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's a great app, i love the infinite canvas. A missing feature that is very useful would be a palm/touch resting are or another solution to avoid the multitouch interference between the pen and the hand/fingers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite note taking app for use with galaxy tablet and s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was wanting an app to take handwritten notes on my Samsung Chromebook Plus. I experimented with a few from the Play store, but this app has met and exceeded my expectations. Writing with it is just like writing on paper, and I love the ability to use Chromecast to project it onto my TV. If you're looking to take handwritten notes on your computer, this is the app I'd recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for Note 5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Data goes hell every time I re-install application. 5 star if as good as AK Notepad without cloud storage."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its really good, but I wish it could sync to other sources of cloud such as Google Drive and Onedrive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I installed Squid on my Chromebook Plus and it's by far the best note taking software that I have used on this device. It behaves just like writing with pen and paper. I've used Squid to take notes, signing PDF files, and drawing doodles without any lag or any trouble keeping up with the ""pen"". I usually can't give apps a full 5 stars but Squid deserves every star! Installing Squid on my phone is just as great but the Chromebook's pen is far more fun to use than my finger or stylus. Squid, an Android app running under Chrome OS, is marvelous and adapts to the large screen like a native app. I recommend!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Falsely used PDF markup to lure others to download. The reason to download is for pdf markup. to not have the feature available freely, is a lie. to not mention the payment is a lie. negative 30 stars. enjoy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Strange purchase policy. No sync."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Osum app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app,  subscription model seems a bit much for incremental improvements over other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works beautifully on chromebook pro. stylus fast and accurate"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app... Five stars.... Easy to use..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it mainly to annotate pdf, which it does. But when I go back to review I cannot swipe to the next page. It will only let me click a little arrow at the top."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It was amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I use for everyday writing at class, office"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would be better with syncing between devices but a great app all the same"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for a while. Finally need to sign a pdf contract but found that there is no way to save as pdf or export it. I'm sure it works great if you don't want to do anything outside the app but for my application it was a fail."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only searching notes feature is missing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Now they took some things out and now make you pay extra 'premium' for them. I understand adding things and charging but literally taking features out and then charging for them is unacceptable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note app for note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love a pen and paper. This is the next best thing, and no trash;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Grate application and excellent support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even the free version is wonderful. I take all the notes in the class with this app and save them as pdf and add to dropbox for later use.  It also gives many editing options and a number of colorful add-ons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For the Asus ZenPad s3 10 with a stylus, this is not the most accurate. PDF import is a 5$ purchase. Split screen works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me organize myself like never before on a digital notebook. I use it for everything and it's awesome."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Offers the features one would expect from an app for note taking, very extensively, nothing more, nothing less."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best of all I tried"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The selection tool could be improved. As now it only selects rectangles even if you carefully cut across exactly what you want. The way it is sometimes I can't move only what I need and have to re do and erase"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App to take nice notes and export them as PDF files. Only things I'm missing is a feature to autocorrect geometric figures (straighten lines, correct circles, triangles, etc) Also a table creating tool would be handy and to set highlighting markers and as background layer to keep colors true  Except for those few improvements I'm very happy with this app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it would be very good, however export capabilities is not perfect, like I can't export or share with todoist, and if we can have better integration with evernote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I could accept subscription payments if it was a new application. But to lure people providing them with reasonable app and then - after they are used to rely on it - to change name, add some rather secondary features and require periodically (!) amount of money comparable to the price appropriate for previous version lifetime licence?

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I don't like a premium subscription. I prefer to purchase apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, with an excellent handwriting interface.  The one drawback that would take this to 5 stars for me is  between-device syncing, ideally with a web interface so that I can access and edit notes from a desktop or laptop, similar to how I use Evernote or other popular note-taking apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is the best sylus application on Android for both phones and my Samsung Chromebook Plus.  I love how you can add images and resize them on your note page. I upgraded to the premium because the ability to add PDFs and the premium note backgrouds are worth the annual subscription. I rated this as FOUR STARS because setup menu for backup and cloud storage, the application is limited to Dropbox and Box.  As a Chromebook User and Google Pixel user, I am immersed in the Google Application environment. The ability to backup notes on to my Google Drive is virtually nonexistent.  I will edit my rating in the future when the option to do so is there...."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"App is good. Practical and good functionality for work. However saving the work as backup is only limited for Dropbox.  As a user I need to be able to backup / save my work on hard drives, flash drives or whatever other preference I have. This is the only issue I'm having."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Change it from 5 star to 3 star. Overall is good, I use it for note taking at class using my Samsung Galaxy Tab A 8.0 With S Pen. Problem is, when I writing at the lower end of the screen (wide ruled, A5, potrait), typically at the last line, the ability to write smoothly seem to decrease and my writing become ugly. I try One Note for comparison, and there is no problem at all. I really dont want to change to One Note because of this, cause Squid is easier to use, so please fix it will you..? Just contact me for screen shot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I dont like to pay monthly nor yearly, i want to own the app not rent it."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Can't sync with Google drive, and syncs by period of time rather than by when you edit a note. Suggestion forum is ignored by developers and is filled with spammy adverts. Can't move or resize a photo after initially importing it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for taking notes and making drawings as notes.  Use with a screen recorder and you can create effective hand written lectures. Like a prof on a whiteboard"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect needs a better widget though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The grid background is pointless without the ability to snap the grid intersections. I guess it would be an okay app for drawing or taking notes, but it has none of the important features required to do precise work (rulers, snapping, line segment bisection, and angle rotation to name a few)"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The eraser wipes out the entire page writing when you touch the page. Why can't I  just erase an area or section?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I recently switched to squid for my work notes, because of its ability to work offline, edit pdfs, save directly to my phone (note 4), work with my stylus, and locally backup notes.  I've used a number of the more popular notetaking apps for work or personal notes, and so far am pleased with squid's capabilities.  I think it is definitely a developing app, with a lot of room for improvement, but most people would find it useful and user friendly.  A couple freatures I would like to see is the ability to have notebooks within notebooks (for better note storage) and a close-up mode similar to snote or inkredible (I like taking notes on letter sized paper, which is a little frustrating with this app.  The infinite page works well though).  Would definitely recommend giving it a try!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Easy to use and features are great. Would be even better if there was a more quicker way to include screenshots or maybe import a word document without having to screenshot it. Also would be easier and quicker if you could just swipe to go to the next page instead of pressing the arrow on the top corner of the page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I tried to install it on my Samsung Tab S3 three times.  It would download fine, but then got stuck and not install.  The last time I restarted the tablet first, no luck though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to purchase the major features it advertised.  If you are going to make me pay 4.99 to write on pdf then state that in your description . Other than that is just a note pad"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Most of the features require to upgrade to the paid premium version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Paid user here. This app has so much potential and is so useful, but it is hurt by a few key problems. If the following could be fixed, it would be one of the best apps on the Play Store:  1 - Please add continuous scroll for PDFs, like in Adobe Reader / Foxit.  2 - If you add continuous scroll, please allow PDFs to still be editable in continuous scroll! 3 - Please allow default widths to be applicable to imported pdfs, whether in portrait or landscape; it's a huge pain to have to continuously zoom in or out for every page of a document I'm reading / scrolling through.  4 - Please enable full screen with no toolbar up top; maybe a single finger tap could call up or hide the toolbar, like in many other apps? 5 - please enable inverted dark theme for text / white background! For example, if I'm reading and annotating a screenplay, especially at night or on an AMOLED display, it would be great to be able to make the white PDF background black.   I've been hopping between Squid and Adobe Reader on my tablet because both apps do half of what I need. If squid could add the above, it would be great and I would keep paying for it."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the response devs! I really enjoy this program. I use it for creating music charts to practice along to and also scanning my existing music into PDFs for mark-up. It's really useful for that. My only suggestion would be a single touch page turn (maybe an option in view-only mode) to make it easier to turn pages while playing. Right now, I have to export and use Kindle to have easier page turns."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"muito útil!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Honestly my favorite note taking app. I wish there were numbers you could enter for the size instead of the sliders."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As Chromebooks gain touchscreens and Android apps, this app will set the standard for those note taking on those devices.   I downloaded this app for my Samsung Chromebook Plus and, within 15 minutes, decided to get the paid version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This program has become more indispensable the more I use it. Just wish it had better sync across devices. Would like to be able to delete pages with a file (only available on a Windows phone)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a good note taking app as far as handwriting with a stylus goes but the typing feature is a little unecessarily poorly formatted. Also it doesn't save directly to google drive but you can still save it to your chromebook device another way if you have one. I think its great for if you want all your notes to be digital."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This was lit"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good, 5 stars, this app is great for pdf files, excellent for hand writing and just a great all around app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing for on the go"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Paid for version of app crashes everything I try and perform a back up to PDF.  Used to work in earlier versions but not anymore."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app if you work with PDF reports!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it.. Most useful app while using Spen.. Small suggestion just to make this awesome app even better would be to add thumbnail view on the side, so that we can easily jump between pages. And an option to customize the tools layout would also be pretty useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app that supports the active pen. Premium purchases are worth it. Much easier to use then LectureNotes, but not as customizable. There is no latency in regards to pen input. The pen chooser is quick and intuitive, but there is room for improvement. I purchased all the premium features and among them my favorites are the highlighter and PDF import. Premium paper patterns are only available as a subscription service. The cloud backup (also premium) implements Dropbox or Box as the backup service, which works fairly well as a backup tool. However, I would like a cloud sync feature (like Dropbox on the PC or like Google Drive) so that my notes automatically sync across devices. Right now, it works more like a backup service then a sync service even though it uses Dropbox. Your changes on one device will not sync to the other device, you have to do this manually by restoring from a backup and saving a backup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for notes, could ďo with a page widget for 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Most functions are ok but the bad thing is when we slide the screen with single finger supposing to slide the screen, it unintentionally becomes deleting pencil lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great Features,Easy to Use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"4 6/12. Please add seamless scroll and continous pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This would be a 5 star app. I love all of the options. It works fantastic except for one major feature that keeps me using other apps. I need folder support. So until they have it for this app I will have to use LectureNotes or searching for another app. I have bought all of the options in this app and love what it provides, but I can no longer use it until they have organization options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Ability to mark up PDF files is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very nice! I bought the tool pack, was disappointed that only one font was available. Would be very nice to have fonts and some other basic text editing within text objects, including changing size & color of individual letters.  Also would be great to be able to create custom colors & save palette."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I cant put in words how I just hate this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was using Squid free and it worked just as well as Premium, however, I did update to Squid Premium to unlock the import pdf feature. I absoutley love this application. It has done wonders for my college studies. I am able to save to my Goggle Drive which I love as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's perfect for taking note, but... 1.The backup option never works completely. It always terminates midway 2. Only the ruled and blank background work 3. No audio recoding option Please fix the first two problems and add the audio recording option... I might go back to lecture notes of this continues :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredible"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the simplest and easiest one I've found to use with my Tab with S pen. Everything is easy and seamless, and you can export straight to pdf. I love it and I've only used it for a couple hours so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's an app with alot of potential. There is some useful features as well. If they get better cloud syncing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app to take handwritten notes in. Although typing with text can be improved. It would be cool to have the text boxes support bullet points so it's easier to take notes while typing. Also it would be nice if the cloud storage it supported was more than just DropBox and Box (Google Drive would be much more preferrable). Otherwise, I love everything about this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only thing that I would change, make images editable after you put them in the notes"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool for students!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Galaxy Note 3 with Lollipop on T-Mobile.  This is a good s-pen optimized application with Chromecast support.  Being able to draw with the S-Pen and erase with a finger is handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"And ANOTHER app that goes to a subscription model... No thanks. Find some other suckers for that. Goodbye."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I wanted to buy it because everything that's useful here is not available for free, but I found that I cannot buy it, I have to subscribe. What is this a dating site? Get out here! I recommend INKREDIBLE APP - great app, much better than this scam."

I have lost all my notes multiple times now because this is the only app I have that doesn't sync with drive! ahhhhhhh please fix this..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tried it first and liked it! So paid for a subcription and been using this in my note-taking. Thumbs up, 5 stars!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very helpful for hand writing Notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. First missing option for me is write on image without using background.. will be awesome when it let me open png file and add some draws and notes to the picture. Important is to do not loosing quality . Otherways is great app and is not that big minus to give only 4 star. So strong 5 ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. World be great if there was an arrow tool and a multi-line tool..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Fiinote app is better than this, note taking is easier in fiinote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app - I have yet to find one that works best for the Samsung Chromeboo Plus.  Only think I'm hoping for is cloud synchronizatoin with onedrive or google drive in the future.  Other than that, it's pretty much my ultimate note taking app for my classes!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why should I have to pay to be able to use such a basic function such as making text on my notes?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app. I'd give it five stars if I could scroll through the pages, like an endless list, instead of having to flip through pages."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app but missing some important features. Sync across devices for one. But more importantly, the back up to cloud never works. Every time I connect to wifi, the app tries and fails to backup. I can't even export a pdf backup. Would be nice if the app worked seeing as I am paying for it..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it on my Galaxy Note and find them an excellent combination. I looked for a zoom feature where a page I zoomed opened at same zoom settings and it was added. Developers listen to users feedback and act on it quickly which is great to see. Simply the best"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works really well for PDF annotation, but it would be nice if PDFs were searchable. Also, it needs to use the system clipboard, not just an app-specific one!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's perfect for engineering"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bought a windows 8 pc just for the handwritten note taking features with stylus support. I needed an app where you could copy areas of hand written text and then paste them and resize them if needed. Papyrus does all of this with aplomb. I have since ditched the pc in favor of a Galaxy Note 2 and Note 8.0. This app has changed my life as a writer. Please do not take away any of the current features and please keep flourishing as a company because I truly love you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Was the best note app. Recently I just lost my phone and can't recovery any notes (premium option). Migrate to Google Keep now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ten stars for super app 💝❤💝🌷"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very handy for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Note 10.1 and this app made me ditch all my notebooks, u literally have a nootbook of infinite pages. Editing is easier than in alternative apps. Big thanks to every one in the developers team."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful classware"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best noting app so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very impress.ls time the app-developer add keyboard as alternative use..must phone don't have stylus pen.hence virtual keyboard is essential as compensation. Hope you take this piece of advice  on board. Thanks and keep the good work going.( Customer )"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app that could be a lot better with a couple more features. Namely: rotating selected object(s), directly accessible drawing tools, grouping of objects (or layers). It would also be nice to be able to draw a circle with constraints (so that it is 100% circular) and from centre. I use Squid for technical DIY concept drawings and features I mention would make the app a lot better for this purpose. Selection is also imprecise at times - it's really hard to select a line even when you zoom in very close - several taps are necessary. Oh and automatic synchronization/backup across multiple devices is badly needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the quick loading. It's a never ending handy tool to have around me when I'm thinking up stuff on the fly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for note taking at work during document review and client meetings. It is a killer app when used with the s-pen. I like it so much I have bought a second tablet with it to help boost my paperless efforts at the office."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for taking notes, summarizing / annotating a book, lecture or online course ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Was here since the beginning with the HTC scribe pen. It was pretty sweet then and got even better. If my files synced to a Windows 10 device too, I'd use it more than onenote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I rely on this app to take all my school notes. Clean layout makes the work flow very fast and effective. Only improvements I would like to see is notebooks graphically displayed as tiles as well as the ability to create sub folders in notebooks and groups of notebooks (binders?) to keep things organized. A handwriting to text feature would also be very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is really great if you have the Lenovo Yoga Book. The app will recognize the stylus and then treat your finger as the eraser. I also appreciate the options for grid and rule styles.  Of all the apps I've looked at for note taking and sketching, this one has the best set of features and an interface that mostly stays out of the way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"full screen portrait 3:2 ratio  on chromebook plus worked fine now it doesnt...trash"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As this is a subscription service you would expect significant upgrades each year to compensate for the premium price being charged. On some things, as pointed out by many people, there is real room for improvement. A good app with potential."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would give a 5 star if able to rotate object (really need it though)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its actually quite convenient for marking pdf documents but sometimes when i opened  pdf with it nothing shows up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is by far the best whiteboard program out there. Too bad it's subscription based for all the extra features because I would definitely buy it for a one time price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good app for handwriting notes.  Only wish I could make sub-notebooks."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I have a Samsung Tablet and I have this app loaded on it. It's wonderful for taking notes in my lectures. It has great zoom capability and ease of writing. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Onenote has better multiapp sync support ( also can be accessed in browser ). That makes other apps like this inferior for my purposes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have app for Samsung Note users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best. Even free version is intuitive and useful. Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app.  I recommend the premium adders that let you draw squares, circle, strait line, etc; as well as the upgrade that lets you back up to your for service.  This is one of my most heavily used apps other than Gmail and Chrome !!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I need to pay money to start typing text using the keyboard !!! It is a note taking app !!! LOOOOOOOOOOL !!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A handy app for writing quick notes, or marking up PDFs. Could improve on the typing functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app very convenient already in its free mode. Unlike most of its competitors it has no annoying ads and writing with a pen and insertion of screenshots works with particular ease. I also like that it supports various sheet sizes like A3 and A4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Has a subscription. I have issues with every software developer wanting to charge subscriptions these days. This is a bloody note taking app, let me just buy the damn thing.  Edit: Versioning lets the user pay for the app on their own terms and when they want to pay. If you keep designing a great product, people will keep buying newer versions. It's essentially the same thing as a subscription, just much less aggravating. It's just another bill to pay this way, and since you deal with bills as a developer you can respect not giving people another bill."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Get pro for android it's worth all 600 pennies"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's a pretty good app, especially if you lack an external keyboard. However, I wish they implemented the keyboard better. I would love to use arrow keys to switch between slides and scroll on my trackpad to pan around pages. I also commonly get errors when opening a pdf from an external source (like my files app). Overall though it's quite useful! I would rate 5 stars if the above features were added."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP. Even if you cancel your subscription they will continue to charge you every month. Cancelled my premium service on 10/23/17 and found that ""Steadfast Innovation LLC"" has been charging my account for November - February. Sketchy company probably sell your data to anyone that will throw them a penny. Greedy bastards refund my money!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You have to to buy something to use text, ugh"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It triggers wifi everytime I launch the app. May be the only problem of the app but if you fix this (and probably add a cloud saving feature) it's going to be the best note-taking app ever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great app with very handy features. A little more versatile than SNote in my opinion, I still use both, although you do have to pay for some of the more useful features I think it's well worth the cost to transform your phone into a very useful tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app. So much you can do with it. Very versatile."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for fingers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love how this app provide smooth writing and processing while using with PDF files. However, there's some smalls stuff that should be improve. It should be able to import multiple PDF at once. And need Search feature in PDF file! I focus on PDF since I am a student who have tons of PDF lectures. So please consider my review."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dose exactly what i need as a student, would recommend buying premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You can't delete a page. You can't reorder pages. It is very difficult to even reach a page you need in a large PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Went searching for a drawing app with good pen/tablet support. I was amazed at how responsive squid was to any gesture I wanted to try."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Used to love this app, but the little bugs and requested features never get fixed or added by the developers. The Dropbox back up on my device consistently fails(especially in the pdf back up mode,) and the ability to have infinite scrolling with a set width has not been added even after being request by many users for what is going on years now. I put almost $15 into this app, but the culmination of the above and some serious stuttering while scrolling is making me look for an alternative until these issues are fixed. I hope to come back, but it is up to the developers now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really like this app for note taking, homework, and teaching on my Chromebook Plus. My only really complaint is that I wish I could have multiple tools accessible through one tap on the main toolbar, instead of having to tap multiple times to switch tools (multiple pen configurations would also be nice to quickly change pen size)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"kaisi you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Littil More Originality"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I honestly love this app for almost every thing that it is. I only wish a couple things were different.I wish there was the ability to search for words or phrases in my notes and I also think that you should put the ""View- Only"" option along the tool bar for easier access. Other than that this is perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, been using it on my tablet (with s-pen) for quite a while, great, very very useful and intuitive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for making this beautiful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app definitely worth getting the upgrade"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Unable to cast to chromecast  (Android 7.0, Chromecast (2015))"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really like this app so far. My only request would be to add arrows with the shapes menu then I would give 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish it had cut and paste feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have used this app Daily for about a year now. Must have for note phone users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is good but it did not allow me   partial copying. Is it possible to copy part of notes into a full page?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I thought it could be used to upload a pdf and highlight things on it... It can, if you want to pay!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this App! Highly recommend for any student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There needs to be an easier way to change pages, maybe a keyboard shortcut. (Chromebook Plus)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There are only a handful of Android apps that run well on a Samsung Chromebook Plus, and Squid is one of them. Takes full advantage of the built-in stylus, and much better than Google Keep. Great job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done. Very organized and easy to use interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I use my tablet for note taking for university and used it during a levels. In the past I gave this app a 5 star review saying all it needed was a writing input zone (something I know many many other users would agree with). I am extremely disappointed to see it still hasn't been added as a feature, especially as users have been requesting it for such a long time. It would make writing in this app much much much easier. Something like what lecture notes and notability have in this regards would go a long way. Also having endless scrolling for your pages (again like lecture notes and notability) rather than having to press between pages would be nice as well as it would be quicker to check past lines of works when doing long equations and such. Add these two features (preferably as one time pay features seeing as they feel like key features to every other good writing app) and this review would instantly be changed to five stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, I enjoy very much this app...I Wish more feature can be added to this app, like pallet with more color,  I wish there is fasterway to switch from pen to eraser on panel or other feature,but overall this app just great.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The pdf annotator needs lots of work. Highlighting can't lock into a straight line, text entry/annotation is clumsy, changing between colours is time consuming. Not at all practical for the amount of annotating I need to do on my documents. I honestly can't understand how making a decent pdf annotator is so hard. Cancelling my subscription. Am close to giving up on finding a decent pdf annotator for Android. The developers of this app should check out GoodNotes for ipad, which I would give a solid four stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would love that the premium subscription worked over all platforms"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Disappointed in how many features require a subscription... Even the highlighter pen tool. Beautifully designed app with great features, but so much is behind that paywall. I don't know if I feel comfortable paying a subscription for tools and layouts that basic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best whiteboard app I've ever used!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app. I use it as my note taking book at university with the Samsung tab A6. It only could improve if it had tools like drawing 2D/3D axes for math and other things that simplify our lives as students -- not just squares and circles ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"LoVing iT.. 💤 💤 💤 💤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very usefull if you can by the premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just installed it and I love it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the first note taking app I've used that's better than pen and paper. I use it for studying all the time now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good enough"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dropbox backup works well now! the new pdf import style is nice. What would be nice is having a page spacing tool like one note. As well as a auto correct shape tool like one note as well. All in all a very useful app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the idea of having infinity paper. App is integrated with my Samsung Note' s-pen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Unable to load different type pages.Just ruled and plane pages are working."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a graduate physics student and use a tablet and stylus for on the go computations.  This app is the best I've found for simple and effective note taking. Good job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for taking notes at University. It is the perfect app and I love how everything looks. I use it with my spen and I love the fact that I can erase with my finger instead of switching to eraser everytime. Please keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I saw that this app changed to a subscription model so I didn't update the app. I understand and can relate with the need to change the financial direction of the app. However, comparing this app to a Moleskin is not buying you any points. Choice for me? I'd rather purchase the moleskin.  There is a tradeoff for electronic notes vs traditional notes - there is nothing like a good pen to good paper vs flexibility for manipulating electronic notes. How much of a boost to the finances will subscriptions bring?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything is awesome when you can write it down with pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"once I paid correct tool, able to use for Japanese kanji mnemonics; should be useful if you do Korean or Chinese, Vietnamese etc KitKat still fails to write backup to ext SD Card"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I already payed for the app once... And it used to be premium.  Now it's no longer premium and have to pay again for special paper and cloud backup functionality..... Rip off... Squeezing as much out of us as you can... Shame!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app for note taking...  purchased ad on to make it even better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great at taking notes, I use it all the time, however it would be better if developers could fix the following 2 issues for the samsung note 10.1:  I am unable to insert images, I never have been able to, and it would be very handy if I could add diagrams to my projects and notes Secondly, when I write that grow large, squid simply closes the note and I am unable to see what I wrote in it, effectively losing notes that I need. This bug needs to be fixed, thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Eh"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs table option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid works with the S-Pen!  It should be expected, but Evernote is laggy and Google's Keep,  which writes beautifully, is so rudimentary as to be useless. I did get the paid version to support the developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A godsend for taking notes on the go!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, best app for stylus that I have ever used, far superior to S Writer,  the Samsung default app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"NYEH HEH HEH! I, THE GREAT PAPYRUS, MY NAME IS THERE! nope."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Just Dl'ed and haven't used it yet. Will change review to +/- after I've used it a few times."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great but hard to back up & move notes to another device"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best note taking app I've used. The pdf feature is a must"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful, clean, and minimalist."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great good work, But not good pay month or year, No way, No thank."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I often forget to use TWO fingers to move the screen up and down, would prefer to use my stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app & valuable tool for Note. I use it for school especially for note taking on class slides. Unlocking pdf import is cheaper than printing slides. Awesome features when everything is unlocked.  An annual subscription rate  sucks. Better to pay individually to unlock  features than subscribe. Please rename as ""Squid"" and lose the ""formerly papyrus"", clutter. Wish there was a $6 fee to permanently unlock all the features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Allow people to try all feature for some time..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"baru saja instal, langsung jatuh cinta, ini yang sedang saya cari cari, belum nyoba banyak sih, tapi so far oke lah dan tersedia fitur standar yang cukup baik. tinggal beli stylus nya aja agar menulis jadi lebih enak."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs Google Services Integration Like G Keep and GDrive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You should put a price on this and use it to fund further development - this is a near perfect app! - UPDATE - in-app purchase of cloud services well worth it! I worry that some documents get corrupted or become otherwise unopenable - lost one doc this way, but it's a beta - UPDATE: Fixed in .23!.  I love the ""infinite"" page size, and the copy/paste. Storing individual strokes as vectors or otherwise independent objects makes them easy to work with, and they look great at all zoom levels! Rating bumped to 5. This is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Seems well supported by devs, cloud backup is nice, I like the pressure sensitivity feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for taking class notes. I've tried several others and none compare to this one. It can be put on an SD card so it doesn't blow up your memory."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the pdf functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Update.   I did not understand how the premium features would show up.  But they do and work well.    Upgrade to 5 stars!  Love it.     Old review: ""I like Squid,  but can't get the premium features working.   I have an Nvidia Sheila tablet that has Squid pre-installed,  so I suspect that's the problem.   But regular features are good and work as advertised."""

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for drawing things I need. I've been using for 2 weeks and has more items than SNote (love SNote). Recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great annotation app.  But If I'm paying a dollar every month, I should have a search function.  This is ridiculous that it is not included."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My most used app.  Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I downloaded and tried dozens of other apps and this is the best by far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am using it as a daily journal so as not to mix them in with my S notes, which are business notes. Haven't printed them yet, but hope that is easy also. If it is, then I would possibly rate this 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can't incorporate typed paragraphs because of the lack of text box customization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I find it very useful for brainstorming, note taking, cartoon drawing, and composing music. Specially with the premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is ever best app in android. Specially in Samsung note tablet so the one thing I have  thought missing is so missing felt. Dual page view,, Please make dual(two) page in landscape mode like moon reader or XODO. Then your app is no flaw. And minor request also I think floating pallet option that would be very useful in pen note, 2 requests i want maybe everyone who using tablet want. Regards"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent handwritten electronic notes. Simple and easy to use. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I had rated it 5*, but it keeps freezing and now won't open my note. Also, it is pretty unbelievable that you still haven't added the ability of scrolling between pages and writing on SD in lollipop (xodo has that, no rooting required)"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bad hiya"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Шкарный блокнот для работы со стилусом. Лучше всего мне подошёл. Наличие безразмерный холст страницы — просто киллер фича. Учдивительно, что ни у кого её нет. Скуповатый набор инструментов по сравнению с другими, но это всё равно позволяет делать больше и удобнее чем вы сможете сделать на реальном листе. В принципе даже доп набор инструментов можно не докупать (мне хватает вполне ручки, посимвольного ластика и вырезания областей, но купил чтоб поддержать разработку)…"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app that beats other apps such as evernote and onenote. Only bad thing is that the app lags on really long stokes so writing in cursive is a bit difficult."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,",BOX"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you need to do math or diagram something this is the app for you. Unlike most apps, your work is not constrained to a certain document size.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had the free version for week then decided to try the $6 a year ""premium"" subscription and man is it worth every penny. Many tools, formats, backgrounds, workflows... the best note taking app I've seen for mobile. Works best with stylus, if you are wondering, but it is possible to take typed notes too... I like to open 2 windows sometimes and take notes in Squid while watching a video or something all on the same screen. Android is more and more impressive by the day"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice but add 3D shapes. I've been looking for them in every app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works well on my Samsung Tab A and I use it for work notes.  I recrntly backed up from an old device to the new one and the feature worked seemlessly. It's worth paying for the premium version once you're familiar with the free one."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have a note, without the fine point stylus it's hard to use without a bigger screen but I'd buy the full version either way. I use this to track my progress in my knitting patterns and write journals etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for taking hand written digital notes. It works well with my basic capacitive touch screen tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than one note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Rubbish design"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not impressed that I bought the Premium subscription for the Text feature which I could not even test before buying.  Then I found its a text ""box"" that has a pop up window to enter text which is awkward.  BUT you cannot go back and edit any text.  Really.  ALSO if you enter a lengthy amount of text, it does not wrap. You would have to 'know' where the page ends and put in ""returns"". Really???"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After installing I went to import pdf to write on and it says to pay $4.99 to do so!  Uninstalling now!   Don't promote writing on PDFs as free.  This is only reason I even downloaded. I found one for free that does what it says... write on PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I went completely paperless with Quid + Nvidia Shield. Now the main concern is to remember to charge the tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I had bought the in app premium packages and now after I reset my phone and tablet under the same account and device, it wants me to subscribe to premium. I had this app when it was called Papyrus and was annoyed when it updated to squid and I had to pay for stuff it should come with. Now it wants me to pay again?!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Says its free. But in order to do anything other  than android tablets can already do, it's $5. FALSE ADVERTISING."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would buy if it had OneDrive support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"-2 stars because cloud sync between microsoft store and Android doesn't work. Great tool otherwise though. Works offline! Draw on screenshots, pdf files, then export and send!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could you enable share to squid from other apps, which is immensely useful.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Lost everything after reset because they do not allow for data to be backed up using standard Android/google backup. I have my phone set to backup using Helium and standard Google backups. All my other apps resorted fine except this one. Please take note this if you have important notes you do not want to risk loosing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it often."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nuff said! What more is there to say, really?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good features, allows you to insert pages within imported pdfs which is the winner for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The apple created notes and notes it way better than this. You only get 3 free items, with the notes you get it all! 😝😝hate this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for math"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have two galaxy note devices and one more that i retired a while ago: Galaxy Note 7, Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 edition (tablet), and a Galaxy Note 2 (retired). In each instance I feel that Squid (formerly Papyrus) has dont a much better job at note taking than S Note could. I feel that Squid at least acknowledges that you are writing with a stylus, and S Note merely makes the S pen do whatever a finger could do, just with better precision. For serious note takers, Squid all the way!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Doesn't really come with all the listed features. Need to pay/upgrade."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think the app is very good but the premium features are confusing to get and the subscription can't use Google account balance. I wish there was just a simple premium version app I could buy in the store with the extra pens, PDF import and backup. -------------------------------------------------------------------- I still feel that it would make things easier to have a premium app version available but I think it's a great app and I really appreciate the assistance and feedback. Changing to five stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for quite a while & love it!  If your Personal Electronic Device has a stylus, you need to try this handwriting application for taking notes.  I wound up purchasing the PDF add-in so I could import PDFs &  write on them too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time, for the most important note taking. Infinite papers are my favorite! Being a serious note taker, I've loads of stuff I compile and keep meticulous record of. Squid is great! Happy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it would be perfect if can import bookmark from pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An improved text tool like the one in snote is required."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"awesome this app even has cornell temp,ates onl thing missing is index cards and mind maps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Well done!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"But until they add more cloud service providers for backups it's not worth paying for premium or five stars, for that matter"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. Very dependable and easy to use but I wish you could choose different types of pens. inserting an image acts a bit funny and draws up the image blurry every once in a while but its still a very cool tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I had to change from Samsung 8 which used S-Note. I  am looking for a new handwriting note taking applications. I loved this, loved the reviews, but with out palm rejection I cannot use. Too bad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"BUT I won't pay for subscription services! Sell it one time only and I'll consider, but there are plenty like this that are single payment only."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Could really use the ability to have the app open with folder view ( as it was waaay back when...) rather than recent notes. Maybe a toggle so users can decide???"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Stylus is paid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if you could log in in order to have access to your accounts in different devices or even your PC"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can we get MARGIN please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app out there. It provides a more natural note taking experience. Of all the note taking apps out there, Its the closest  one too actually mimic writing on paper but with so many powerful tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works very nicely. The only disadvantage is that you cannot manage your documents with folders so that it soon gets hard to find what you are looking for. Also there seems to be a bug with indefinite pages so I actually  lost some of my notes once. Apart from that it is easy to use and very handy for taking notes in lectures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Accross platforms from Android to Surface....excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It seems like a really good note taking app, but it does not let me click on anything.  I am using my stylus, but it will not let me change colors or select anything because the app does not register there is something to select.  It actually continues to write behind the color panel, or even the tutorial dialogue box, instead of selecting the options on the panel. I really want it to work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"a good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an update on my previous assessment. Squid is without a doubt, at the top of its class. This is the writing app you must have if you own a Samsung Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this primarily at work to take notes while meeting with coworkers and my bosses. I use a Galaxy Tab A.  Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yo la uso todos los días, ya no necesito cuadernos, solamente tuve que conseguir un lápiz táctil. La mejor aplicación de escritura cuando no tienes un Galaxy note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"loved it just hope it was all free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Squid to take orders at my job.  One click on my home page widget and boom a Squid note opens and I'm ready to take down info.  Fast and feature filled.  I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Looking for a note taking replacement now that I have to give up my Samsung Note 7. This app fits the bill perfectly. Why didn't I know about it sooner? Nicely designed, great features, works like it should. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this almost every day at the office. Simple,fast and flexible app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best products I've used recently. It's superior to Samsung's own note app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Now I can keep, organise and update my notes very efficiently. Thanks a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfectly useful in a tight spot for notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I especially love how you can use your active stylus to write, then your finger to erase a mistake without having to Switch it out in the menu, just like you do with pencil & paper.  One thing that would be great is if it would work well with pdf files with link (interactive pdfs). The program lags terribly when attempting to do any markups and the hyperlinks don't work at all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Man I tried lots of note taking apps on my tablet by far this one is the best. Beats OneNote effortlessly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very little to add, except perhaps for palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I've used it for years. I just wish you could change the page background to a pic from your gallery."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple n practicle!! accurate in writing using my s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally able to sketch pictures I want with the pressure sensitive stylus the can with my Samsung Galaxy Note tablet. And being able to export a note as a PDF to my Google Drive for  easy sharing is fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Loved the features enough to buy the subscription, user interface is really good and does not interrupt work flow. The only flaw is that pen tool leaves a lot to be desired. There is only a highlighter pen and ink pen and the ink pen in particular is pixellated at all magnifications. Ink smoothing or adding additional pens would make this app perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for Samsung note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app needs  highlighters"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I already purchased a subscription in April 2016 and today again Oct 18 2016 it charges me again $6 for something I already have.  Now I am fighting for a refund. Don't you guys keep track of your subscribers? Very inconvenient.  The app is not even that good... This turns me off completely from using this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the best, especially with a Samsung note.works perfect with the stylus.I'm just waiting for sub folders, then it will be perfect for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!  Very versatile!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Government"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent to take quick notes.  The minute I downloaded it replaced ""s-note"" that came with my  Samsung Note A tablet. The tablet's home button gets in the way and I have to lay the table ""upside down"" to get around it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hi. Would you consider putting an option to have passwords for the notes? The samsung s-note has that option and I consider it quite a plus so I could doodle my private thoughts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. The support staff are very responsive and helpful. As a teacher, Squid is indispensible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"PDF functionality only available with paid version. Otherwise, inferior to Google Keep"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"great app but started crashing and  cannot open anything anymore as it stops immediately on opening a file"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I only make comments when something is really really impressed me. This app is one of them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, but it would be better if it had a ""no-detection"" zone to have a place to rest your palm while you write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking software I have ever used. When using the Galaxy S-Pen it is like writing on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ummm...I watched a pretty helpful youtube vid by a college student and think this will replace 3 or 4 other apps. And at first glance the paid options are worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesomeeeee"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its very useful for me to note each items"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used many note apps , I find this app the best . I'm planning to subscribe premium . Thanks to the developers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great on my Note 3!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Keep up the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice, simple app that does everything I wanted and much more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bloatware. How do I uninstall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"hope to be more organized and contains sub-folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"On Samsung Note 3  the best.  Write with s-pen and erase with finger. No need to switch to eraser."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still a great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish it had more art features like paint can or pencil"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Work grate"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"single touch pan the page (with a lock icon) also needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a ton of different apps, but I always come back to Squid. Easiest export, really good selection tool, can add photos, and the infinite zoom is so useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Helpful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice to work with. Has enough features to be useful, but retains a simple feel. I export PNG to Evernote, as Squid is so much better with the S Pen than Evernote's handwriting function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid, paid or free, is great. Its pdf abilities are better than anything on Android or even iOS. The only thing comparable would be One Note on a Windows 10 tablet. Keep up the good worth. Premium is well worth the cheap subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing lacking is an input filter to smooth the strokes. I notice a very ugly ripple on the strokes and words when I zoom in a bit. Otherwise, the app is very nice. I really like the UI and the ease of writing with it. I will have to keep using Quill until Squid has an input filter though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Idiotic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Note your life. Note life. Squid does it. Makes it easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Unreal app, only thing that would make it better is a functioning agenda"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for both sketching notes and marking up/signing documents and drawings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best integration app out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"All the best features,  i.e. adding a text box are not available in the free version. Bummer. It would have been better than One note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Got this for taking physics notes and its worked quite well. The subscription model for backgrounds isn't really worth it but the paid unlocks are reasonably priced for the functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app now. Best note taking app I've used now. Just need to add multiple pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best & most straightforward Note taking app that I have used, way better than the s-note that came with my note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nicest android app to mark up pdf, better than adobe for sure. Highly recommended for note taking too"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Writing on a note phone is extremely poor. Your writing comes out huge and without any sort of magnification tool you can't write on large paper without seriously working for it. I have no idea how people are using this on anything but a tablet. It's so clunky on a phone screen I'd rather use the default S-Note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use Squid daily and as such feel guilty rating it 4 stars, but really believe the following changes would bring it up to a true 5 star product.   1 - We need to be able to search the note header but a separate searchable user definable field would be ideal. 2 - The note headers are listed below the note thumbnail on the startup screen.  They should be listed above each file. 3 - Backup and restore has been buggy, it must be rock solid and not a resource hog. I will instantly raise my ratings if 2 is chang"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Very useful. Sometimes the pen just loses the position. In this cases, I simply roll the page, undo and restart the last word."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used to use One Note a lot when I had my Surface Pro. When I ended up getting a laptop to replace my Surface, I still missed and needed the writing feature of the Surface. I was able to get a tablet with a digitizer and started using Squid. It is perfect for note taking and marking up PDFs which is required by my job at times."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does everything it claims to, perhaps more when you start to learn it. Fast, clean and has an easy UI. I've started using it for business, I think I can actually go paperless now. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I set primary side button of galaxy note 8.0's s-pen as true eraser tool but it doesn't work. How can I solve this problem?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"If you're going to advetise pdf edit capability, It should clearly state it requires the paid version in the description.   Squid is a stupid name"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"backing up PDF broken"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App is amazing and premium is a worthwhile investment of 90ZAR a year makes the S pen worth its weight in gold!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is extremely useful and the developers are constantly improving it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great tool for annotating pdf files."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for taking notes in all of my subjects, I use it everyday"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow its the best app for tabs and androids.♡♡¤"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm rating it a 4 so hopefully the devs are more likely to see my suggestions. If anybody finds this to be in bad taste, I will change it to a 5 star to reflect my actual opinion of the app. First a quick review. This app is fantastic. I use it for taking notes in university. I use it to jot down video game ideas. I use it to doodle when I'm not paying attention to a lecture.  The free version is everything you need to take sufficient notes although I've payed for a few tools to enhance the experience; well worth it. If i had ONE wish, it would be that notes would have tags and be searchable by the tags so that we could search for notes by the content. Titles just aren't enough for me to remember everything the notes contain.   Adding compatibility with multi-window on galaxy tablets would be awesome too so that I could read a pdf textbook and take notes simultaneously. Anyway, thanks for saving me from wasting paper and pencils and erasers. Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just wish it had a little better palm rejection. But overall, very good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Love the app!! No back up/sync is unacceptable. I have a note 7 and now have get a replacement and will loose my notes. I'm moving to one note. Please fix, as I much prefer this app, but need to use multiple devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the versatility especially using the physical keyboard for markup using tiny text. The main reason I use an ipad is Notability. There may be an android tablet in my future or Windows."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for samsung galaxy tab and samsung note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just buy it if you have a Galaxy Note device, it smashes S Note, although, developers should allow black background color for any type of background, since all Note devices use AMOLED screens, it would help us save a lot of juice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Every time I want connect It says unfornly sqiud stoped"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I do love it and see some modification would be so helpful. Like an easy way to sync all my devices, and the ability  to add video clips and record audio while writing notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It really works well as a commentary tool for Onenote or Evernote. I find the pdf import is a great tool, but I would like to be able to search for terms within the pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great way to download your professor's PDFs and take notes all over them.  Squid is really off to a good start, but I think there is room for improvements. There really isn't anyway to sync the notes I have taken to other devices.  I have to end up downloading and exporting in order to see them on other devices. And if I make changes I have to export it again. I also wish I could add pages in between pages of PDFs. Honestly if these features were added I'd pay tripple and it would be the perfect product!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I enjoy using this app for reading and marking up pdf's and other documents. However, the options as far as importing into Squid are somewhat confusing, which may partly be on the Android end with file organization, but it still is a problem. I also have had some problems actually getting downloaded pdf's to open in Squid from the document itself, which again, may be an Android problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Testat många stylus-appar. För att anteckna i ""tom anteckningsbok"" är Squid den klart bästa av dem alla (på en Samsung Note 10.1).  ... Synd bara att Dropbox-backup slutar fungera efter att anteckningsböckerna kommit upp i en viss storlek... (Ingen inkrementell säkerhetskopiering, utan allt i en stor fil, från 0 till 100 varje gång.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have not updated in a while until today.  Oops.  One third of the screen realestate is being used by the HUGE BARS on the TOP and on the BOTTOM.  Please put everything back on the top bar and give us the option to scale that bar to a narrower version. ok.  that reply does not respond to this NEW review."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy, intuitive, and great features. Everything I needed to switch from paper to digital only notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app for samsung devices....just needs to be able to write off of pdf files and not be constrained to the PDF page. Also add sd card storage as the default"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a galaxy note or tab with Spen this is an essential app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just great! Very user-friendly and well organized. Finally I've found the ideal notepad!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for taking notes. Easy too use. Not flooded with unnecessary tools. Simple screen. Convenient.  Easy to load. Love the backgrounds. So far the best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Waste of data"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hands down THE best replication of the handwritten note, free-form sketching, and even downto the most meticulously detailed drawing actions produced by the human hand with pencil, pen, hi-liter, or any other writing utensil you can think of.  I've tried all of the others and Squid is without a doubt at the top of he ""short"" list."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Seemed a good app, but flagged by Norton as malicious with latest update. Uninstalled. Not sure if false positive or not."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application for taking notes -just try it, you will love it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Needs to add the Save as feature but a great app for note taking or lectures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app is good for note taking. If you don't need to export to PDF, get it and you will be happy. I need to send notes as PDF files and that's where it does not work. Well it works, but 2-3 pages of PDF with couple pictures will be 50-70MB file! When I go and compress it on PC, same quality will shrink to 300-400kb.  So compression mechanism for PDF is non-existent on this app. Sad, but deleted!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is simply amazing, I wish I could have used it to write this review!  The capability to draw over other documents, add highlights, edit PDFs, add shapes, lines, text. There are so many uses for this. I'm off to explore other applications by this developer. THANK YOU! Keep developing these tools and you may give Bill Gates a run for his money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very cheap subscription for awesome backgrounds(templates).  This is by far the easiest and most useful pdf/note taking app available. Customer service is through the roof!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does everything that I require: handwritten notes, typed-up notes and export those as pdfs. No trouble with this app whatsoever. Highly recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I already reviewed it before on another device, but I still love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. I use it every single day on class. I only wish it had a voice record feature so that I could record my lectures as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Any gadget that has stylus should install this app.. it's practical and easy to use. It's also budget phone friendly.. i install it on my 4 yrs old tablet and it respond very well ! Good Job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to store pdfs of all my lecture notes, make annotations on the pdfs while lecturing in class, attach photos/doodles of relevant board work. This app does it all, and makes it easy to stay productive and organized. Nothing else I've tried has even come close to the functionality and ease of use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't need to buy notebooks for my classes anymore and hurt my shoulders by carrying all of that! I just take my tablet to class and I have easily edited notes that are nicely organized! I LOVE that you can edit your drawings after the fact because teachers can sometimes say things out of order that I'd prefer to arrange them. Or they mention something is a test item and I can just change the color after I've written it. This app is my new essential! WAYYYYYY better than Bamboo Paper!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You need a widget that takes you directly inside a note please,  then I'll change it to 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best writing app I have used!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The add-ons that i have bought previously can't be used after the recent updates. Update: Managed to get the premium features to work after i uninstall the app, restarted my device and reinstall the app. Apparently this seems to be a common issue. Hope that the developers can look into this issue. Updated: Seems to be working well for the past 6 months."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Get it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Currently in college and being able to takr notes on a pdf saves me so much time, space, and money.  If it had a second layer of sorting it would be perfect, but still worth a 5/5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Total like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for my Note 5 :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and subscribed but I realized that I can't live without a sync feature which is very handy in school, so I'm canceling subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love love love!  As a mom back in school for nursing...this APP is simplifying my life! No more lugging 10 # binders !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All that I know is we are very much comfortable and fast in reading our own handwritten texts then any other one. So I strongly suggest this app for everyone."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent effort . I suggest ungrouping the tools from pen tool for quick note taking ,which make every tool has a single tap access . that's my little lag . THANK YOU FOR THAT GREAT SOFTWARE ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After struggling with the slow and clumsy S-Note, Papyrus is a relief, offering the basics needed to make notes and sketches quickly, without having to spend much time choosing and tweaking pen settings, etc. I especially appreciate the availability of standard paper sizes and grids that reproduce to exact scale in a PDF. The small cost of the tool pack to add shapes, text, highlights etc is well worth the cost. Interface and organization is simple and most importantly, fast. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"paid app could be lifetime, not monthly or yearly paid, except that, a great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As simple as a piece of paper and a set of pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"seemed good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nearly perfect feature set but lines look terrible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I've ever used for taking handwritten notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Makes you pay for stuff that won't even work well. Not at all worth it!! Give me back my  money!!         :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Well I used papyrus ""squid"" for years, and from the beginning it was promised that other cloud backups would be supported, they never were but nbd right bc I just used dropbox. Well fast forward to their crazy name change and updates which caused my notes to quit auto backing up, unbeknownst to me. So I lost about a year worth of notes. From September of last year to the other day when my Note 4 decided to die. This app had so much promise for years  I'm finally over it and will be using an alternative.  :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app. Would be much better if one time fee instead of subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"1 star. I've purchased most premium features on Papyrus. And now you're going to subscription route? What will happen to premium features owners?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for organizing notes, pdfs, writing on PowerPoints , great for finally trying to get rid of paper. Love it. Just wish there were more pen options like S note but the user friendliness and functionality on squid is absolutely unmatched"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to pay you every month to use your app? There are better apps that cost one time 4.99."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love writing my notes with this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Loved Papyrus and believe I paid for some in-app purchases. Which have now disappeared with the name and marketing model switch. Sorry, but I'm not going down the subscription route. There are too many great free note taking and drawing apps. I will pay once and have paid for a number of freemium apps, but not every dang month or year, sorry. Also, this app has no sync functions so I can keep up on my other devices. Google Keep is nowhere near as good at drawing - but I can see those notes on every device and computer I own instantly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is a great handy tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would like it to open a new note when I remove the S pen.  Also,  every time it updates it removes the widgets from my home screens.  Otherwise it's a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great, better than anything else I've tried. Only lacking synchronisation features such as with Evernote (S-Note has that) and realtime PDF sync with Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No matter what or how I draw/write, it looks very jagged. Your feedback page has had the suggestion for 3 years now to smoothen input. It's the only thing keeping me from rating you guys 5. Great UX otherwise!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used S-note, Evernote and OneNote. This app is better than all of them.   Key features are: endless scrolling, many different line and grid options, unlimited color selections.   The most surprising and useful feature is the ability to use your finger to erase.   The only features I wish were available is the ability to set a few predefined stroke widths and colors. This would make color coding notes easier. A more robust text tool would be nice too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for organizing notes. I am using the Note 3 so my note taking space is limited, but I am excited about using this on the Galaxy Note Pro. (UPDATE) I am now using the Note 5 and loving this app even more. It is worth it to pay the small fees and unlock the premium features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Need colored pens of all kinds . Colorful people won't satisfied if you don't want pay for in app purchases. Get quick memos instead. I think that's what it's called."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Love this app!   Except it will not create a backup or export my PDFs to Dropbox.   Please please PLEASE FIX THIS Problem!!! The most recent update did not fix this issue for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2014 Edition.  Will give 5 stars after it is fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great except one thing: I paid for the backup feature and it doesn't work. Whenever I try to upload PDFs the app simply stops during the upload. Sometimes it uploads some of the files, sometimes none at all. Please fix. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"New name, new image, same GREAT app & service! I use this app on a daily basis- it's so functional on my Note 2!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outstanding!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great job, I use it as a flyer marketing tool , vector based export is wonderful, but appreciate if you can allow customer to copy his own fonts files and use it will be wonderful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used this everyday for the last 1.5 years and it has enabled me to never have to buy a notebook again. At first it was difficult getting used to the two finger scroll, but after I did it has made taking notes fast and easy. The infinite paper size mode is great for scratch math paper! There is a lot to love about this app and I hope they continue to update it to make it even better.              ------     (3 year update): It's perfect for daily use. Updates have been great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use it daily! My only request is to be able to create sub-notebooks. Squid could be even better if the user could organize notebooks more efficiently."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice complete program. Much more superior to S nNote that comes on the Galaxy Tab. Love that you can cast your notes to a monitor for a meeting. The interface is just beautiful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can you please add an option to lock or secure chosen files?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Substantial updates, great features and likely more to come."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was OK app but recently I'm unable to export jpeg files via the Samsung messaging app.😠😠😠"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works seamlessly with my other applications & dopbox.Love it !  worth the $6"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On Samsung Tab S2, it saves your note,  but when you open it again,  you only get a blank page! Please fix this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I actually love squid. I'm only giving it a 3 because of a couple issues. First, it crashes often and you can lose some of your work. In fact the last couple times it crashed , it then immediately asked me to rate it. Ironic? Second , it can't sync. So if you have it on your phone and your tablet you can't update notes across the two. It does have a backup function to Dropbox which is at least some comfort. Third , I wish it integrated better with Windows so I could edit and better work with my notes from my laptop. Otherwise , it's simple and personal. I originally looked at lecture notes , but it was way too complicated for what I was looking for. For simple handwriting notes and PDFs. It's great. I highly recommend it to corporate trainers , because you can put all your lesson materials in it and you don't have to lug around a big program binder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Now I can export as PDF and JPG and share to other applications.  Great improvement.  I give you five stars now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I need to write over PDF texts and that's the best app I've found so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"most feature locked"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I bought and paid for the tool pack, to get the Text option, but it doesn't work well at all, I'll never be able to use it properly. I wish I could remove the tool pack and be refunded. That's why I like apps that let you try first."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I loved this app, and used it for my college notes, last year. Before you introduced the subscription, I was going to buy it. But now you have a subscription for this? No thank you. Uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this for taking notes and doing homework in college. I can't even start to say how much paper this has saved. Thanks Dev team"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Super :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Add the option to add a cover to your note, like a book. Then add some stickers to adorn the notes, and of course, the option for text, (Georgia, Bookerly, etc.) and the option to add and delete pages. Basically like an electric notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what's needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy 2 use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the problem is the app cant insert gif images...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Used for a conference and didn't have to worry about hauling around papers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has a little bit of a learning curve, but it is very handy for taking notes and creating pdf files out of them. The import and modify tools for pdf files are very nice as well, and they are definitely worth $6 per year."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"One thing that i would like to see on this app is to flip page, as everyonce in a while i get docyment that is upside down and its not fun at all. Besides that its good old app i like it alot, please no more crazy updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I love the Noteshelf  app for my iPad. I've been looking for a similar app on android, but I have not yet been successful. The writing is not as smooth and it's difficult to write because you can't rest your hand on the tablet like you would for paper. Noteshelf works around this in a few ways. First, you can use Bluetooth pens. Second you can set a palm rejection region on the screen.  I will continue the search!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I used this app to make some important notes and when I opened them after some days it just showed an empty note with the title. My full data gone. Hate this app don't download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry, no way am I paying monthly or annually to unlock a productivity app.  You guys need to figure out a way to make your money up front.  $6 is okay for a permanent license, even if we get no more upgrades after a year.  But to essentially rent an app a month or year at a time, no can do.  Too bad, it looks promising."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good work, now i will buy premium features .."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy but effective, really love it!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I can't keep my palm in the page  same like what we write in the paper, if I do so  I'm unable to write anything , and also when keeping my pal page zoom out frequently, if write without resting on the tab or app my writing goes very bad. How to manage this..?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Writing with my finger is not smooth. I think it's designed for stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than keep and Evernote for handwriting..reminder should be added in free version also"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No help provided, even after multiple requests.        I have responded to your email. I hope to hear back ASAP. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Well designed app. A bit slow on Onyx Boox M96, and importing pdfs requires a paid subscription"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Liked it originally but when I used it, it launched an app behind the note which obscured what I was trying to copy / make notes on. Now uninstslled but Google play store opens up each time I use the stylus - really annoying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think many users wish to add Sub-folders... but we can't :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does what I need quickly and efficiently. Best I have tried so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I Updated and lost my pens. You said that if purchased in the past ( first of this year ) that option would be retained. Please give them back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's perfect for a student with multiple classes you can lighten your book bag load and keep everything organized in one place. Absolutely love this make note taking so easy!! I use it constantly!! Could add a voice record to be able to record classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very hard to use with a normal capacitive stylus. Unable to ignore my palm when writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It may look nice but you have to pay 2.99 for all the features ( highlighters, shapes, etc. )"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am going to change my rating to 5 if squid allows multiple device syncing and premium subscription is per account and not per device. If it can't, I want a refund. Pronto."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"And I like their business model with reasonably priced add-on packages when an original free app is already much better than many competitors.  I had already bought myself ""tools"" package."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"...so I can start using Papyrus as an S Note alternative. 2016 -- 4 YEARS LATER & no widget. They've added numerous payment options and subscriptions, but no added value. I have a feeling if I handed the developers $10 million they would still not add a widget. Imagine if all developers of the 400+ apps I've purchased wanted $1/month. That's  $4,800.00 anually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"God"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"One of the best designed apps for handwriting on printouts. Love most of the tools, keeps everything organized, and it looks beautiful. However, it is lacking in a few departments.... 1. There is no keyboard functionality other than just typing. You should be able to scroll, and have full control of the cruiser 2. Communication between devices is awful. Back up, restore, back up, restore, repeat. 3. Premium customers should be able to access on Windows and android, w/o any additional fees!!! 😑"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great features and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One way to improve is to make the highlighter be behind the texts & the pen cause they get blurer when you highlight them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really enjoy this app and the fact the monthly subscription is not that high for premium users makes life alot easier..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great little app & helpful / communicative developer.  Been using the Premium (though NON subscription) version of this app for about 8 months now.  It's generally been great!  The only things that have been a little tedious is that the Cloud based sync using Box can be a little on the slow side when you have an increasing number of files .   Also when you have a large ongoing (""infinity"") sized document, strolling can be a little on the slower side as the document when fully sized & takes a few moments to get reconfigured / repopulate with each swipe. With the kind of docs I create, that can delay things when editing & looking for a section.  Some people have expressed concern about the subscription model being 'enforced' on them. Personally I don't have a problem with developers going subscription & would have upgraded to it if it offered more features than simply a few paper styles that I didn't really have a need for or if I didn't already purchase all the Premium add ons.  But as I purchased all the Premium add ons separately last year (which I believe is / was still an option now ), I didn't yet see the value in going subscription. Time will tell if this changes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dear developers, could you please add the ability to rotate something after it's been selected !! I really need it for my designs! Thanks and love the app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I used to use this app years ago  when it was called papyrus. However since buying a note 10.1 I wanted to go better than s note and this was my first option,  very, very let down by subscription!  Why would I pay monthly for an app?? I would gladly pay £10-£15 for all the features outright however there's no way I'm subscribing.  Greedy developers spoiling applications again, your software is great enough to earn you money through initial payment! Looking for other non-subscription apps like lecture notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Alternative to S Note. Just add poto note. Though option take note from pdf but Photo note current be awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love handwritten notes but I hate any paper (as it can get wrinkled, ripped, eaten by my dog). This app is so great when it comes to organizing and taking notes. Fairly simple and neat w/ a few cool specs (ability to open pdf files directly). Lots of cool layouts(Cornell style). You really do have to get the premium to access the ""good stuff"" , but don't let that scare you. It is super affordable($1/month or $(O / year) and very worth it. Still a few things they could improve / fix (e.i. ability to sync between devices). If you like handwritten notes you should try the premium."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Already purchased premium features,  why to pay again for new features,  such as templates? Besides the buttons of N8000 tablest still doesn't work (erase button)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for tablets with pens, and saves as vector data, keeping full quality, good work! Re-review further down the line and it's still a fantastically useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app  easy to use. Just like an A4 notebook but not as much bother!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So, in the interest of full disclosure, I've only ever used this app on my NVIDIA Shield K1 with the DirectStylus 2. Squid has some special functionality for this combination of hardware. Now that that's out of the way, I freakin' love this app! I use it for school. I use it for D&D. I use it for work. Anytime I need to take a note, this is the app I use. If you have a Shield tablet, this is a no-brainer."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, never need paper anymore"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I wanted a notepad thst would let me cut and paste. Help says its possible but not found in the free version. Uninstalled it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"At least until now it's awesomeeeeee!    Suggestion: Could you put a search tool?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using Squid/Papyrus for a few years, and I highly recommend it!   What makes it better than the other handwriting apps is, that you can use the Stylus pen for writing and erase written text by touching the screen with the finger, so there is no need to switch between the pen/eraser mode.  Features I would love to see in the future would be a search mode based on handwriting recognition, and a way to sync notes between different devices.  Thank you for the great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Was working fine... but cant import pdf files with more than 100 slides...it is just crashing..please fix it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does what it says"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Note 12.2 and tried multiple note taking apps. This was by far the most straight forward and intuitive app with the features I need to export the file to formats I need for work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Having a spread sheet function that does calculations would give it 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple to use yet powerful. 4 star instead of 5 only because of lacking inter-device synchronization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So I can lay fingers on screen while typing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good design of usage, really enjoy using this app to take note daily. It may not as sleek as S-Note, but for day to day function wise I prefer this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For the most part everything works. I cannot sync to dropbox anymore but it is possibly due to the overall size of my files. I use this app religiously."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Quick & easy to access. Great forshopping lists & for jotting down ideas & contacts on the fly. And great that it is new backed up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is the best app for handwriting that I have found, except it needs to be able to automatically sync with other devices through DB or Drive, then it'll get the full five star it should have"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking quick notes during meetings, creating shopping lists, and jotting down reminders. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for devises with adaptive stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can we do rotation?  Cause it slightly misaligned"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"My purpose was for note taking. I did not like that there was no zoom window(like in Inkredible or Notability), because this made it very difficult for me to take notes quickly during lectures. However, I did like the fact that a paper size option was included, because it could lead to easy printing. Yet, the liability of not having the advancement could not help me during class, and I don't recommend this app for that reason."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Frequently crashes with the music cliffs background"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Art"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's easy and simple to use, yet very handy. For work especially!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled and reinstalled squid and found that all of my notes are gone! No Warning on uninstall that all of my notes would be erased. Is this really true? On is there away to recover my notes?... I was finally able to restore my subscription after losing all paid features for several months. It turns out that Squid could not tell that I was the main software user. It thought that my son's account was the main software user. Not clear on how it got confused. Never the less, after removing my son's account from my tablet, and after uninstalling and reinstalling the software, I was able to use paid for features. But the final burn... After restoring my notes from cloud backup, I lost all of my notes from since 5-Dec of last year. It seems that Squid broke my backups during the move from what it was formaly, ""Papyrus"". Although I love the features, given the huge loss of data... I give only 1 star. I wish better luck for others."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"this is the best note taking app in my opinion.  BUT IT'S SO F**KING BUGGY . I PAID  for all services and yet   1.  i cant export my notes in PDF to dropbox - keeps on crashing whenever i attempt to do it. tried restarting etc to no avail  2. constantly crashing whenever im working on notes with numerous pages (20 and above) i have to reopen it up to 7 times in an hours lecture  these 2 reasons alone make this app a bad choice to invest all ur notes in - only to realise that u cant mass export them like they promised u to. i have hundreds of notes that i might have to manually export.   F**k this stupid app"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It allows us to do about anything we can think of!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Now you can draw anything with S pen then export to image file or PDf file, no search function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Bought all the premium features and now a licence model has shafted me - shame on you devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I can't seem to put it down! I've tried dozens of note taking apps but none suited my purpose....until now! I would write in it all day long if I could. I never knew an app could be so addictive! I literally have to force myself to put it down during the day and when it's time to go to bed.  I would recommend this app to everyone!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was bit disappointed that Squid moved to a subscription service, but I understand their reasoning. That said, you can still buy the individual premium features in the app, you just have to find them. This is one of my most essential apps, keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love that I can write in my natural handwriting or type and can draw in it. I frequently use the picture insert. Best there is! I quit looking after I found this app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Eveything's all good... I make thw notes, some stuff ain't available ('cause I'm not premium) but that's a-okay... That is until I click the note again and everything I wrote disappeared. Like what was the point of majing one if it disappears the moment I look closer?? Is saving a premium only thing, too?! You shouldn't have mde if free if it's like that. Better yet, you should've indicated that this was just demo, a taste, and if you won't pay, you can't use it. Seriously. Still, pretty cool app..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient. I don't have to run around looking for scratch paper nor do I dig in my purse looking for pens to write a quick notes."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for note taking and pdf editing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't have ability of syncing up my notes between different devices. Very hard to keep up with different changes. Online backup and restore option is very basic and doesn't cut it... Planning to transfer out of squid... Sorry"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Subscription-based apps appears too tempting to many developers, both individual and corporations.  I do not have a problem with apps being either--except for when an app is changed from paid features to subscription.  Regardless of how it may be presented, it is no less than an underhanded move by the developer.  If developers were to be fair, the previously purchases app would NOT be 'transformed' into subscription a based Frankenstein, but instead, presented SEPARATELY, as a new app.  Doing otherwise is simply vile."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for note taking. Easy to use and works great with Galaxy Note stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking; has every feature I want, feels natural to use, and is not overly complicated. The ability to markup PDFs is also very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app because it helps me take notes on the go and it converts my notes into vectorized pdfs. Also, I LOVE that I can save the pdfs directly to my device rather than having to upload it to a cloud each time."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's  one of my favourites"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's awesome but the text input feature is a bit disappointing. If it supported rich text input, I think it would be perfect and it would be a great premium feature! A bit disappointing that this idea has been on your suggestions website for 3 years now :("

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great apps.. As the tagline said.. I dont need a paper no more.."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be 5 stars if it linked with Google  drive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the infinite mode canvas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The notes are there but nothing on them, just their file names. What's wrong with the update, I updated today. Please fix. (I'm using Samsung Note 4)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great notepad app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After several months of trying the many stylus-friendly handwriting apps out there, I find that Squid has risen to the top."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the easiest-to-use Hand-writing app in the world! Good job at making this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a lot of 'em. This one is just the best. Try it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it for everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for just about everything that I need to write on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using script note programs since the Treo; Squid is the most reliable: reading, storage, and recall, I've used in droid, possibly ever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have for s-pen users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Usually works without a hitch for my pdf markups and that's all I require for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy to combine handwriting and pictures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still one of the easiest and most versatile note apps available. When you add pdf editing and creating, you have a very powerful sharing tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Currently a student at UCI and I use it for all of my classes. It also helps me with personal training."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am a new user, and I initially liked it so much that I bought a year's subscription. However today I was reviewing a note I wrote yesterday, and letters were missing (sometimes strokes/parts of letters too) .. I was wondering why this happened and how to prevent it happening again. If the issue becomes consistent then I no longer want my subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love doodling with this excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I only use it for annotating PDFs. For that it's good, but the need to switch between edit and read-only to change the zoom slows me down a bit"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"They say you remember things better if you write them down - Squid makes that easy- even in this day of tablets and styli. I've sketched closets and living rooms, drawn mind maps, doodled during meetings (shhhh!), taken notes on my next big idea (or 10). It's easier to daydream with a pencil in my hand than a keyboard under my thumb. I use this app more than any other app on my phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Make it whole free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Been using this for quite a while now, switched over from S Notes.  Vastly superior to S Notes until now.  I just lost three days worth of work.  I noted that they were blank, opened them up, nothing there.  Drew some figures in each, wrote a bit, closed them.  Could see it fine in the preview, opened it - nothing. No longer in the preview either.   I noted it had recently updated. I can't use it any longer. Great while it lasted. Gave it an extra star based upon how great it had been.  Samsung Note 3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I bought this app quite some time ago as it was what really accompanied my Galaxy Note perfectly. Since I was a pro user I could benefit from all pro features. Developer changed billing system to subscription variant and all my previous pro ""benefits"" are gone. I am really disappointed and will only use general settings as I refuse to pay for something I had already paid for in the past."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I was expecting so much more from this app but looks like everything I'm looking for is in the premium version. I think there are better alternatives for free note taking apps :\"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App to translate thoughts into paper, Love the templates and save the earth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I bought the toolpack for this. It adds some good features but I expected more. For example built in arrow shapes, the possibility to change transparency and stroke types on shapes, and outlines to text (when annotating images this is useful)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does not have the tragic zoom problem that S Note has! I use it for meeting notes all day every day, with joy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The features I would use a lot are not free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just check out the exorbitant and regular ongoing fees charged for the premium version. It is daylight robbery"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app takes S-pen note taking to the next level. Gladly paid for the extra options. Anyway, if you don't wanna pay, the basic functionality feels premium. Major go! I paid for the cloud sync features and extended editor. Respect! The pricing is just decent, no need to talk about that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It keeps switching on the wifi when the app is working and keeps switching it on even  when I switch it off. on my note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Had to cancel my subscription because of way more customization possible in other apps e.g. dark paper colors, input zone etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So cool, but some odd bugbears prevent me from using as much as I'd like:  Not sure why you can zoom less than in the old version?  (I like zooming in to refine, which seems to be quite limited now)  The payment model is all kinds of borked.  Would have gladly paid for this outright, but charging for fairly prerequisite features, which accumulate to a pretty expensive app just seems wrong.  Cloud backup? sure.  Unique/awesome features? Also sure.  Get the dev a beer feature? Double sure. But ransoming a proper eraser seems a little too Candy Crush for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best notebook app hands down. I am so much more organized and am saving so much paper in the process. Paying less than a dollar a month is absolutely worth the premium features ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It has lots of features and paper designs, but the only issues are typed text doesn't wrap and there aren't different types of lines that can be draw for example dotted lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Works fantastic but always need updating. Its quite annoying and starting to feel like a Microsoft product- always needing updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost everything I want and more.  My notes all stored digitally, in full color & with my illustrations. Integration to auto backup to Evernote would complete me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All in all a very good app for my studies. Unable to change pages by swiping is little annoying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I swear by it. Just need a few options like creating pdf's and adding a page here and there and it will be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I use a Samsung note 10.1 2014 and every time I import a pdf it crashes after going through some of the slides. I paid money for the service and since it keeps crashing it's worthless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for handwriting on a Galaxy Note! Would appreciate the option to add layers, but that's the only shortcoming I can think of..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is easier to use than any others I have tried.  But I don't agree with monthly or yearly fees to use it.  I should be able to upgrade for a one time fee."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I haven't even downloaded it yet but that logo is amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Right now one of the existing widgets allows to open a certain notebooks tag screen (very similar to the normal app icon, therefore that widget type is not very useful)  and the other widget opens a new notebook from scratch, which is OK because it gets me straight to a notebook page to start writing but it's a brand new notebook so it's not exactly what I'd like. I suggest that there should be a widget (shortcut)  that will open a certain notebook in one click so I can start writing right away. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app but don't like when apps like this ask for a subscription to get the premium version. S/be one single fee only and not overly expensive like so many are for their premium versions. A $9.00 one time fee would be an acceptable cost for what is being offered for the  premium upgrade.  I could use the additional features in the premium version but I don't use it enough to justify paying a monthly or yearly subscription. Change it to a one time fee and I'd be happy to give 5 ⭐ & recommend the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With the right equipment this as close as your going to get to a traditional notepad. I was the one with numerous notepads floating around and never being able to find anything. With my Samsung Note 5, Note Pro 12, and A9, I have almost gone paperless. I also have to sign many PDF Docs, this works perfectly. I have no problem with the reasonable annual charge, and would pay a great deal more if I could sync my notes across all my devices. A back up with Google Drive would be great also."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using it since it was papyrus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish I could import from Google drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You have ruined this app for me by making it a subscription. I would buy it for $10, but no way for $10/year. As a casual user this is not justifiable. I'll just stick with the free version as my backup to S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Too many good freeware to pay monthly fees. Just my opinion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Still learning, but so far I like it! Use it for work mostly. Great for taking notes and photos, then email to HQ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not liking the perpetual fee model for a f'n notes app. Seriously. Also paid for something/more features a while back, now perpetual fee, nope."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for this app and all or the plugins. Now they want me to subscribe to use them?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for taking notes on my GN3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not able to share notes, that sucks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super handy, lots of features, especially great for a device with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Has a lot of errors backing up files to cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please could you consider making it easier to change between pages! It gets really annoying to have to tap a small arrow at the top of the screen. Also, it would be great if you could have the highlighter option on the top bar rather than having to select the pen icon and then the highlighter icon. Please consider making these changes. I will then give you 5 stars  I love that I can write with my spen and erase with my hand, such great functionality all round. Great that it syncs With OneDrive as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ply text give e on ply store"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Edit (Apr 2016): I don't think I'd be rating this app this high if I hadn't been able to outright purchase the features, and had to rely on the subscription. Plus, what happened to the ability to insert pages before/after? I'm not sure the direction it's headed will bring on new customers...  Previous review: I use this app every day to take class notes. It's everything i could ask for. The online forums are a good tool to provide feedback and it's nice to see where the developers plan on taking things. I'd love to see the ability to reorder pages in the future, but from what i can gather that is already in the works. Would also love the ability to backup to Google Drive instead of dropbox, and select tools straight from the ribbon instead of having to go into a dropdown list. Great job, love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm drawn to this app because it is easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It works so well.  I got a new android tablet instead of an iPad just because of this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good good good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Used to be awesome, after the introduction of this yearly plan bullshit I've lost everything I've bought."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very convenient to take notes and to export them as pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use it for taking notes in college. The features are great, but [WHAT I DON'T LIKE] A one time purchase (in/out of app) is WAY better than the current subscription. The subscribe price is reasonable, but it's low enough that it's easily forgotten about once I no longer use the app. If I uninstall, the sub. remains active & have to cancel that separately. I don't like that at all. [SOLUTIONS] A lifetime subscription for a single fee (I'd pay $15 US). Option to unsubscribe at uninstall."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has a lot of great tools (cloud backup, import pdf, etc) and it's the one I'm using for some time, however it can still improve some minor things (out doesn't have instant cloud updating,  it has poor performance of the pen close to the home button, although it works well on other softwares)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Take note naturally with handwriting, capable of annotation with pdf files (premium), recommend to use together with large screen size smartphone e.g. samsung galaxy tab A."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Uses stylus, has different note page templates... Has become my main notebook for classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use it everyday multiple times ,between work and home!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful in annotating documents. The free version allows to add blank pages to a pdf document to write text. Sometimes, some annotated characters (words) are not saved and one needs to re-write them and re-save the document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it all the time for research and teaching stuff. I wish it had better typed text support like Lecture Notes. Love the automatic backup and PDF export, but it's not working for me now...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"They now charge subscription fee!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You want me to pay to subscribe to the features I already paid to have unlocked? I believe you should reward your loyal customers by not making them pay again maybe...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far it works really well for what I use it for:  taking class notes. The UI is intuitive and it gets many features that one note/evernote have yet to implement in their Android apps. However there are a few features I'd really like to see. One is when importing pictures into a note, you can't import only parts of PDFs. Another is when exporting my notes to pdf, they aren't sized very well for printing, although they're fine digitally viewing because I can zoom. Lastly i would like a print view or a preview of a normal paper boundary, like if I wanted to write only within the bounds of an 8.5x11 paper. Other than that it is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Many of us already paid for the premium version. Now this dishonest developer has rebranded, introduced a subscription model and now I have to pay for all the added features again. Avoid this deceptive developer!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome!  Onenote Alterative. On Windows Its not worth. Because onenote on Windows excels Squid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: Since upgrading my tablet, I have had zero problems with this app. Using it to take notes in class has made it possible for me to succeed in college.  I really liked the idea of being able to write with my finger on a tablet, as I have a condition that makes gripping a pencil very difficult. However, Papyrus randomly closes the note I'm working on and returns to the home screen without saving my work. I lose work, sometimes a lot. An auto-save feature would be nice, so the note would save itself every certain number of minutes. They should fix this random closing issue. It's making me want to find another notetaking program.  Also, when .pdfs are exported, small objects like periods get lost in the process. When working on math problems, decimals are always omitted during .pdf export."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is really one of the most useful note taking and study apps available. Brilliant functionality and easy to use. I use it daily for studying or just taking notes. May I suggest that you add a reminder function that can be linked to a note? And maybe some more customization options for the interface, such as the tools layout etc?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I loved this app. I bought all of the offered upgrades, and the PDF editor in particular was very useful. Now--I seem to have lost those features but am offered the chance to pay either a monthly or yearly fee to get them back. I've already paid for the premium features and yet they've been taken away without a refund. Please get back to me with an explanation--I told everyone I knew to get this wonderful app before this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my needs if you don't have it you should get it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It looks  good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"For the last 6 weeks the program has become unstable and is freezing and crashing. When this happen it loses up to the last 10 mins of work. It is also is crashing when in the background."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really helpful for my studying! If the checkered background appearing while moving the screen can be eliminated, it would be just PERFECT app. ^^"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Guys, I had purchased all premium features when the app was called papyrus, now I am being asked to purchase it again? Feeling ripped off."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only app that could do what I need for university.  Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So useful. Excellent piece of software"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I paid for features before and now you charge subscription. This is not honest. Enjoy the stolen money. The devs of lecture notes would thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just want new pens. Edit: Let me scroll past the ends of the page while zoomed in too,  please. Hard to write on the very edges."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app but needs improvement such as when you are exporting to pdf we should be able to print the whole ruled page and not only what we wrote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple design. Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs free backup"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app,  have it my tablet and phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love love this app !!!! Super easy to use. Erases mistakes quickly !!! Write your note and your done !!! Way way better than one note !!! Thank you !!!!  And s-pen friendly..💖💖"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the way this app is set up, however, I wish I could use my usb mouse to write/draw/etc. This is partly because my mouse is in the shape of a pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use and understand with the tutorial.  Beautiful interface with my Note pen. Excellent transfer from old to me tablet with backup function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. I'm taking notes with it all day long. But being a professional and using it for work also has some special requirements. I would love to have custom backgrounds! I want to design my own backgrounds and then fill the whole screen with it and set the paper size accordingly. Unfortunately, the background cannot be set to a custom image and the paper size has influence on the line distance... I know there is a premium version but I'm not a fan of a subscription model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the few I use regularly with the s pen. Really like the features and never ending sheet of paper. I use it to do mind maps on a regular basis."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My scribbles can continue over several pages and even a single page can be zoomed and panned using two fingers to accommodate more. Thank you. Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 : works very good with a fast screen and tool response. I have upgraded to the premium because of that, but the subscription model only just gets the benefit of the doubt even though I previously payed for all the items (so the dev already got a load of money from me) . I will expect the equivalent of a new app every year (7 euro/year is only introductory). Take note: the new costs of this app places it on par the most expensive apps in the store! So the dev better not mess this up and will deliver as promised. -1 star due to the price"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"We decided to go paperless at the office and Squid has saved me so much time by eliminating the need to print out work orders  when out in the field. Having the ability to have my clients sign off on documents on my phone is priceless. No more scanner, no more worries."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best substitute for notability"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for notetaking, especially for college students like myself. You can easily draw diagrams, import pictures and highlight important points. For me it was really useful for drawing chemical structures and writing eauations easily during class. You can export them to the cloud and have them anywhere. Never again will you carry around a backpack with 5 spiral notebooks in it, all you have to carry is a tablet with this app. One of the latest updates let you set a default page style, which is something I've wanted for a while (I'm fond of graph paper and the default before the update was notebook). Overall, great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Paid for it. Now PDF are broken. Kind repair or refund. Looking for another app. Regards, Justin."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Two improvements would make this the best for what I need. 1. An easy way to send pdfs that you annotated as a group kind of like selecting pictures to send in an email. And a new option to make certain parts of the document un-erasable without having to create it as a pdf first then import it ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have been  use squid, it worked perfectly.  Until recent update, the apps on my SamsungGalaxyTabS2 freeze again and again!! I cant turn to next page. Sometimes when import pdf, some pages not show any contents. Please fix."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The line is not smooth, it doesn't look  so good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Features and services keep shifting, resulting in repeated unexpected feature loss and charges.  The app is smooth (the smoothest, really) & stable, but the overall usage experience hasn't been. I'd rather deal with a very-slightly clunkier app and a straight-up update experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried quite a few note taking apps on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8, and this is by far the best one on the market! I love that after I am finished, I can export the note as a PDF file straight to my Microsoft One Drive account!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I paid over $15 for the premium service. Good thing I did, because all of that is now a monthly fee."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on my newly installed p600 anymore... What's up with that? Oh and I just hope that isn't because of the newly introduced subscription? I demand my money back otherwise if I have to pay again to import pdf's.. or give me back an old apk version so I can avoid this nonsense"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for marking up pdfs. Perfect for classroom worksheets and digital notes with the s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I used the free version for some time, and was always tempted to pay for the extras, but a gut feeling stopped me each time. Something didn't seem right. Perhaps it was paying for features I felt should be part of the free offering. Then I came across INKredible and after a short time paid for the extras. After seeing that Papyrus has gone to subscription, even for people who'd previously paid, I'm certain I made the right decision."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why dont companies realize drop box is  not the best cloud service and include support for all the cloud services?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fast, simple, useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Maybe it would be fun, but... My tablet is not so supportive for writing in hand, so I was really surprised when I found out that keyboard writhing requires me to pay."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday! Ingeniously simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it! BUT it's  annoying you can't  swipe to the next page/slide of a pdf using your finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Effortless! !!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I looked for it and then I found it. The infinite zoom will make these notes usable and help not get your ideas lost over many pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Man, I was looking for something exactly like this and I am glad I found it. Perfect for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I do honestly love this app!  The only thing that I wish is that it didn't matter if I turned the phone sideways and wrote like that. My hand doesn't sit as well as I wish it would across the phone. To be clear, this is NOT a fault of the app, but a fault of my huge Note phone.  Overall, this is my problem. Not something that concerns anyone else. So, in short, it's a great app! Buy premium version and support the devs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have two majors and a ton of PDFs, handouts, and pictures that i can mark up and share. I can take my lecture notes by hand (which feels very natural and I actually prefer to typing). I have 2 majors and 2 jobs and side projects galore. All my textbooks are ebooks and all I need to remember in the morning is my tablet and my keys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Let me buy this as a one off payment of around £4. It's better than S note, but I'll persevere with the free content until the devs lose subscription model."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I like the some of functions it has now, but it is lacking or flawed in many important functions: the text input is pretty awful, where you enter the text in a separate box and then it becomes an object (no way to format your text to fit the page, not even resizing after), it could use some more symbols like arrows or other things (it only has line, circle, and box). The subscription is very barely worth $1 a month. I will be searching for a better note taking software; this one is not suited for school."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Anyway, if seletion tool can select some part of picture, and then duplicate or cut that area ( just like ""paint"" in Window) .It would be fantastic app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is an good app but lacks a very  basic feature of, page flipping/sliding while reading. despite voting for a feature, as said by many, always requests go unheard by squid team :-("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App, Unfortunate they had to go to subscription based"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"5 stars when added"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd pay a one time fee for the premium version though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only bad thing is that you can only import pdf. Otherwise a pretty good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Don't like the monthy. Now we have to pay more for the same services. Now the app crashes more often :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"simple and easy to use. Seems to have trouble opening Some PDFS though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you Use stylus this is the app you MUST have , so easy and simple to use. Wonderful & good apps . LOVE this app SO much ! !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Developers update often. Great for business use or law enforcement note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this on my galaxy note 10.1 and it's the best app to use. Let's me do everything I need to. Worth every penny"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Was going to purchase the premium features and noticed that you've moved to a subscription model since i started testing the program. Greedy, much? Looks like i'll be looking for an alternative."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"thank you, very usefull."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I had paid for premium features and couldn't find where they had gone so thought I had to subscribe to their really overpriced subscription (no it is not worth the price of a moleskin diary every year - seriously??) to get them back. Wasted $9 only to find I didn't need to - can't get that back now. Luckily discovered LectureNotes thanks to another customer's bad review and it is much better for a one-off cost. It is not worth $9 as a one-off cost for this app - let alone paying it every year! They have read the market badly and should take on board everyone's comments and match the price of their competition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had an issue with my premium features not showing up but I've managed to fix it with the help of the squid team- thanks :)  What you've got to do is force close squid and clear your playstore data. Log into the playstore with the account that you paid for the premium features and open squid through the store, it should then work :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything I want in a note taking app for uni, well worth the download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app very Much but after the update I an expected to make recurring payments for the properties I Already paid for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just wish you could set save and send to Google Drive or other apps in one touch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very...  I hv got habit to use it now... :) very nice n useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the improvements made to the app. I particularly like how they added the Cornell notes template. Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Stops working too often recently..... (galaxy note pro 12.2)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app everyday but I'm disappointed that you cannot upload your own bacgrounds. Like a PDF that can be repeatedly used. It seems like a pretty easy feature to add but for some reason they haven't done it yet. I have to search my device everytime I want to use it for a specific PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does everything which I want it to do, seamlessly.  Excellent App !xx"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm always looking for apps that I can utilize in everything I do. I'm downloading, UN- installing cause I don't use them.  I use Squid constant. I work with sketches, notes, pictures, so many different things and this is 1 app, I can use all together.  Worth the cost. Only wish I could sync all devices so I don't have to pay twice for the same upgrade. Also writing lines are too scribble, even when I adjust pressure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app! I've used notability before switching over to android and as far as I'm aware, this app is the closest to being as great if not better than notability. However, I would love to be able to import docs, ppts, excel sheets etc while on the go.  Update: The app is wonderful, but a few hundred notes later and the choice to backup my files to a drive is significantly harder to do. It takes ages for the files to upload and now it gives up halfway. Love the app and all, but there isn't a need to re-upload files that havent been changed. It would be better to upload the ones that have to save time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Always improving with each new update. Had it for years and hasn't let me down"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pdf extension is worth the money"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't like being teased with new features that unnecessarily must be purchased through subscription. They aren't features that require server space or constant updates. Like most subscriptions, it's a way to manipulate consumers into spending more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"For basic note taking it was good. Nothing special and still isn't, there is much better out there cheaper. I paid for the extra features which I wanted at the time. Now they want me to pay again with subscription. How disgusting. I will be putting in a complaint to Google and any features they have removed from me I will be asking for to be put back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I purchased Squid long before the name change. It's pretty good for a ""toy"" app, but nowhere near as capable as Lecture Notes. No problem... I like to support independent developers, and thought the app had potential. But now the developers have gotten greedy, and have moved to a subscription model (for both new and existing customers)  to lock you into paying their living expenses from year to year. In fact they've posted a long article online trying to rationalize their feeling of entitlement... It reminds me of McDonalds workers who complain that they can't raise a family on the salary they're being paid.  Save yourself the coin and frustration and just buy Lecture Notes. It's a much more polished app, is extremely mature and reliable, and they understand what their product's worth! Buy it once and use it forever, including updates. None of this subscription crap!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It was great till they started to get on the subscription bandwagon. You make a good addition to the program, I'm happy to shell out some money to unlock it if I like the feature. Subscriptions is a way to leach a lot more money over the long time. It will also make people look do I really need it? Is there no other free or 1 time payment program? What gets won on the subscription side will probably be lost on the impulse unlock side. My advice is think long and hard before you take a subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a great app it has a ton of features, but it does not have cross device synchronization nor does it have a very good backup system."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just replaced my Note 5 and restored from backup. Its all just as it was."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the new page options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"5 to 2 star for converting purchase to a subscription service."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I used this app when it came out in beta. Then, when available, I bought some useful premium features. Now, the features I bought are gone, and I have to shell out money every month or year for using the same features I already bought. So, goodbye papyrus. We had a great time together, but I'm dumping you for another scribble app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was just about to buy all the premium features, but they switched to a subscription based model.  So I guess I I'll just use the free options.  I understand the desire for sustainability, but everyone is asking for subscriptions.  I can't be spread that thin.  *response*  bottom line other apps get my money, I spend less than 6 dollars a year on note books, and I would have paid for features, now you get none of my money.   I'll look for an alternative rather than pay a subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Subscription fees for a note taking app are a joke when you only update the app with new features once every few months. Actually provide a service before trying to charge like one!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good app made by developers I feel are passionate about it. Updates are intuitive and frequent. However, they charge for features that should have been included in the free version for basic functionality. I bought the extra features, like eraser, geometry tools, and pdf import/export, before they brought in subscription (they let me keep it). These things are amazing and a huge step in the right dir from OneNote (which is abs trash, but I digress) but are overpriced by being priced in the first place. These devs are doing so much right.   I appreciate what you guys do but you can do it even better.  Edit: just read their article and I can see why they brought in subscription. It's ok guys. I know you really want to work on making it better all the time. I'm just not going to pay for a subscription ever cuz student Oh and my opinion about a lot of this has changed after seeing the price. I will consider getting premium if they add amazing features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I previously purchased for full function used but when I update version 3.0 then I loss import PDF function and must be purchase again"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Best app for tablet notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app in all of my college classes. Its an incredible app. By far the best for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I was so happy with Papyrus before you suddenly switched to subscriptions. I was planning to buy Premium.. Now I won't."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used other note apps, but this one is is easiest to use. And it works great! Does exactly what they say it will do. $6 a year is totally worth it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Intuitive and easy to use, but most of the essential functionality requires in app purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"What a joke, they just moved to a subscription based model and took all of the *future features away from customers that already paid for premium features. Bad move. Will we receive all future premium features?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The new version of Papyrus includes a subscription model that takes away features that I had *already purchased* as add ons and now wants me to pay again in the form of a subscription. That's dirty and low. People who had already bought all the add ons should at least get the first year of the subscription for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please bear with me. I am a bit slow. So i already got the premium subscription awhile ago for pdf importing and using text and such. So am i expected to pay again?! Or am i set to go?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been loving using squid and the addition of additional templates makes it sweeter! The subscription is worth it to support the creators and the future growth! And support is wonderful!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Gladly paid for this app before, but with switch to monthly subscription that is all over. If you don't think you were making enough money before, this switch won't do it for you.  Good luck to you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Farewell!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Update: working with Devs on PDF import.  Likely limited to PDFs created with a specific program.  If that and the cloud backup feature are solved, I would give 5 stars.  Used to love it.  But the premium features that I paid for no longer work.  The cloud backup service stopped working over a year ago.  The automated response from the devs is ""We're very busy, but thanks for writing"".  I've gotten two regarding this issue.  Then, the pdf import - the best part of the program - stopped working and hasn't worked for weeks now.  I got another automated response stating how overworked their devs are.  Granted I've only spend $8 on these features, they now render all my previous work with this program moot as the replacement program I must now find will be incompatible with my history.  Try the program for free, but I wouldn't pay for any of the added features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for signature on mobile documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I wished to buy the new features not to pay an annual subscription for them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is very helpful for me especially with brainstorming and completing correspondence school work. I would really recommend if you have a Samsung device with an S Pen or other device that comes with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would rate 5 stars if it synced between my devices, currently only using it on my tablet but I would love to see my annotated PDFs on my phone while I'm out and about."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Yes the subscription is very well priced,  some would say cheap but I just want to pay once and be done for premium content"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app.  I use it to annotate and sign contracts and more+  It really shines in signing the pages of a PDF contract and sending it out by email - PAPERLESS!!!  Galaxy Note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would buy the cloud storage IAP package if it had Google drive as a service that it would back up too. Other than that it's a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for marking up PDFs and it has proven to be a humongous help to me in the different projects that I have"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"You say that a one-time pay option can't support ongoing development,  but if only a third of your current million download count paid 1.99, you'd have 600 thousand+ dollars.  That seems enough to sustain a note app for a while.  The subscription service craze needs to stop.  Charge 5.99 if you need to (which would be 600 thousand if only 10% bought) but not an ongoing rate. I wouldn't pay Starbucks a monthly rate for coffees because the nature of use varies"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"How will I restore my old purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just about the best app of its kind on Google play."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the app and would've bought it, but it's too expensive. And this new subscription model is nonsense. Just make it €1.99 for all features unlocked."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"That's a slap in the face for everyone who recently bought it and supported it! I'll probably find another else where and recommend everyone to do the same. There is plenty of other great nite taking apps out there! Don't buy this subscription bs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of my most used apps on my Note 4. Now my Note 5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid App is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You can't just change the payment model subscription."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best option out there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"use this for work a lot. readily recognises handwriting and produces really legible and well organised notes. Works well with a Samsung tablet and S Pen.  The extra function to import PDFs and scribble notes on and highlight them is greatly appreciated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just wish u could select d number of pages you want to export, and d pages should be numbered"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does exactly what it sets out to do and it does it well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a note 4 and this works so well with it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got this app to use for assignments - specifically maths style ones that are handwritten. The output is a nice small size pdf. I also use it for work check-lists."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've used many note taking apps and Squid is up there with the best. The feature that Squid has that no other note app has is the most amazing pressure sensitive writing! It blows many art apps out of the water. A joy to use. As a note app it falls in with S Note, Bamboo and Keep except that I wish Squid had Keep's reminders and maybe a brush and shader from Bamboo. Reminders though are the main missing thing for me (except sync between mobile and desktop version.) You can star notes and categorize them, import photos, mark up pdfs. I wish more features came free but at least the purchases are one-time. This app is also awesome on a Surface."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this on a Nexus 9 with jotpro stylus and I can say I have pretty much no complaints. This is perfect for note taking, using it in university math courses and it's proven great. Great features and functionality. Just wish it let the user sync their notes with Google drive instead of just Dropbox or box but I found a way around that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very nice application. Unfortunately it bugs and crashed regularly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No Palm Detection"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing! Almost better than S-Note! My favorite part about this app is the infinite pages, anything I do wish there was an option for single finger page scrolling, and providing different types of writing utensils like the generic S-Note App does would be nice. I bought the pro version with two different accounts to support the developer, great work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Notes taking made simple"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and I loveit"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"the premium features in this app are pretty standard... I would pay up to 3 or 4 euros (all features) for supporting the developers, ofc. But not for every single feature. Please considering to change the prices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for lists and reminders!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Handy sketch tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and uses it a lot. One thing however that annoys me is the fact that it makes the text looks duller after it's highlighted. No other app I use does this when highlighting text. Black text should stay 100% black. Please fix this. Go and check Kindle's highlighting if you don't know what I mean."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"And like it alot. Great for note taking and marking up pdf docs. A bargain for what you get."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The zoom and the writing fluidity were much muh better on the pevious version. I wish I've not  updated"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use for everything, class, projects, ideas, work, whatever. To me its like an infinite piece of paper where you can draw and write whatever you want."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. Only, It must have sincro with own cloud, in all ours Device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note app ever... love the tools the flexibility,the cloud backup with intervals, the infinite paper size, and many more tremendous features... good job developers ! Cheers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has been said many times that writing notes by hand is better than typing, but no one wants to loose great notes when a physical note book disappears and this app allows me to make notes by hand and export to my Google drive as pdf, for no charge, best yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As a college student this app has been extremely useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Want to use this as it's great in every other way, but when taking photos from within the app, sometimes they show in my photo gallery and sometimes they don't. I need to know they are being saved in there separately from my note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it on my since my Note 3. Now on Note 5. Just gets better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great except the ability to flip pages is awkward"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It very good for note everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"to taking notes as on paper, just better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this take notes in meetings, sketch diagrams, and simple layouts.  The graph paper option is a great feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it all the time for notes at work.  It would be awesome if it could convert to text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The only thing I wanted was an infinite canvas, but this does not work as advertised. The canvas is infinite down and to the right, but I cannot get to the canvas above or to the left of my initial view of it. Also, trying to pan instead erases your work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, bought the pdf export because I found it way better than the Write On Pdf that's pre-installed on the Note 5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would like to be able to use purchased tools across more devices but otherwise is a great app and use it all the time!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app ever.  Especially awesome for Samsung note users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A much faster alternative to the turtle-like S Note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for playing hangman on Chromecast! But, it needs more features to be as good as Rube!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Is there a function to change the screen from white paper to yellow legal pad?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice interface, but when a year's worth of notes accumulate, back up times become intolerably long, making the app unusable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have it installed in three different device s and I recommend it to friends"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very useful when you have a stylus own."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nniceeee"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love everything about Squid. Just wish it also had writing &gt; text functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It wanted me to give it a five star rating, so this is me giving it a five star rating!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it daily for my business. No more paper needed with note pro 12.2 and this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for notes and editing and sharing PDFs.  I use it every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is really so comfortable to make notes and brainstorming using Note stylus. I feel that this app should be nativitly shipping with Galaxy Note cell phones."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Don't loose the chance to download today."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Erasing with finger is the best function!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love how this app works, the pdf export is also great, however it would be better if the top bar, instead of being mostly empty, had shortcuts to preset pen colours, thicknesses and highlighters,kind of like one note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply great. Been looking for this for several years. Everything what paper does, with added benefits of backups."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Basically perfect, could use a eyedropper tool, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but compare to s memo features.  Smemo is better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this  app.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Dropbox sync has become a nightmare. Freezes up and drags tablet to a crawl ever since ""squid"" update. Shame. I used this app for three years and now I  am seeking alternatives =.. ("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Many applications for work and for leisure makes my job a lot more sufficient and professional"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app gets rave reviews and I can't work out why. Without an s pen for accuracy it is sluggish to respond and hard to write accurately or draw neatly. Most features are behind a paywall. Just meh, nothing amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and easy to work with, you can import pdf and handwrite on it, best thing for studying, really worth thecmoney for the pro version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I've used for a while but there is a flaw when casting. When I have finished casting from squid (miracast), it continues to dominate the secondary display preventing me from mirroring. Want to be able to tell squid to stop casting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just needs an option to attach a note to my main screen like s-note has (this is way better than Snote). Otherwise it's excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for my work to document and share via PDF with clients,  love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid is a lovely little app and turns my Note into a great little sketch pad / whiteboard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works excellent with SPen, and it is easy to export notes directly to Google drive as PDFs. Best I've found for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app helps to keep track of all my information I want to be mindful of."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app! But I'd like to know, if I delete the original file without flattening and saving the one with annotations in the Squid app, will I lose both files? I don't immediately flatten all my pdfs because I'm not yet done reading and editing them, but I'm thinking that as a result I now have 2 of each file and it's taking a toll on my memory storage. What do you advise?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best available app for someone who wants to take lecture notes and do homework assignments electronically.  It could use a better hierarchy system for notes and folders though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"PDF files are very large with multiple pictures but I can compress on my computer.   I have used this successfully for business, auditing electrical power plants and it has saved me immense amounts of time when sharing details. Also using Squid for tracking boat restoration project with pictures and details that would not otherwise be captured using traditional methods.  Thank you for fixing issue with text output to pdf!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note series..loved it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is really easy to use and the erasing with the finger is great, just like a whiteboard for my tablet.  Only things i would like to see added are an ability to look at each stroke in the data file in order to play around with hand writing recognition externaly, some way to change pen styles by pushing the button on the s pen, and i know its a stretch but built in handwriting recognition expecialy for equations. Last one is not needed at all but i would really like to see the other two."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping and editing handwritten notes. Titles keep everything organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everythink is great so far but it really needs a sync option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'd like a dark theme."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and simple. It saves your notes automatically, so you don't have to remember to do it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It needs to give the ability to draw basic shapes graphs etc. In addition to exporting an entire notebook in order at once instead of exporting each document to pdf on its own"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I downloaded Squid to compare with Adobe's own pdf application.  The ink annotation feature of Squid is far superior to that of Adobe.  My only area for improvement would be for multiple export, and not just single or all.  I ended up paying for the. pdf import upgrade for the reason above."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My ""go to"" app for simple note taking. It is easy to use and it works reliably"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For 5 stars you must be able to insert pictures and draw basic shapes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Upgrades are a but dear compared to other comparable apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for lecture in a class"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far. So good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Construction."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using it on a Samsung galaxy tab with a jot pro and it does well.  Bought the tool pack and the typing input option is a bit restrictive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty solid, but it still has the tendancy to freeze up every now and again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very basic but good if u need to write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Another 8 months past and this note taking app is far the best I have used and can find to   date. Pdf import is the most important feature for me. I would be lost without this app but will say it has become a bit stale and could do with some new features. Inkredible have a calligraphy pen which is fantastic. A pen similar to this would be the icing on the cake for this app. Make it an in app purchase and il buy it. All being said..... nice work with this app as it works flawlessly with my note pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is what i am lookin for.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"How about adding a trash can so unnecessary pages can be written off quickly and efficiently"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive, great s pen support, easy to use.  I use it on a daily basis for lecture notes and assignments."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app very much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Squid seems like a very nice app to go with my Note 5. I'm on the fence between squid & Quick Note. Quick offers most of squid's premium features for free, so that's nearly an $11 savings! Quick also lets you sync notes between devices, something squid is still trying to develop. squid definitely has a more fluid handwriting feel to it and offers many more pen colors & paper types. I can see where squid has it's pros, but for the value, I feel it just doesn't stack up to what they're charging. Maybe someday"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than S Note, it support stylus, has adjustable paper size and can manipulate the line drawed.  But it lack ability to save customized tool as a preset tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my default note taking app on my Note 5. I use it daily"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great works with nvidia stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still looking forward for rotation and more shapes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very frustrating to use. There are no useful instructions. I cannot find out how to erase typed text, for example."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't uninstall it either seems to me it's a silly way to get one star from a person that does not use and it's regularly updating something they don't want"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the import pdf function along with a bunch of other things!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is really good, the minimum upgrade made it excellent but like every handwriting app, lefties are ignore. My hand will naturally rest on the key board where I'm about to write throwing it out even in style more"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like Squid but I do wish that it had a more streamlined/faster way of switching between commonly used tools. Additionally, the lines produced in Squid with the S-pen are far more ""spidery"" and inconsistent than those produced in Bamboo Paper or in S-note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Practical features. Thumbs up to the developers.  Room for improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"great app , but still there is a problem with the sensitivity of the pen . i'm using samsung galaxy note n8010 with a bamboo stylus feel for samsung , and the reasult are not best yet . i'm wondering also if you are thinking about the possiblity to create zoom box in order to write more in one page. could be great addin . thx.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm an Architect. And use this all the time .  The import PDF is well worth the add-on price. I use it for notes. Existing conditions documentation. Mark up photos etc.  Simple and functional."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app by far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bought"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does what I need and more. I do like the cloud backup, although it is something you need to purchase, but it comes in handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I found this app by accident under education apps.  Love the fine point and color selections.  Would love a hiliter option.  Don't care for the new name & logo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My main app for note taking in uni. Love it. But it would be nice if we could export more than one note to drive and stuff. Sending lots of notes to friends is a pain since it takes too long."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could be the best. Not enough directory/drawer level. Should be more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works great with my Samsung Note. Being able to make handwritten marginal notes while I study was just what I was looking for in an app. Try it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy practical note paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"However, the only reason I downloaded this is because of the 5th image above"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for editing pdf, taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has everything. Little costly because of multiple in app purchases. But overall very good to use. Must have if you have a galaxy note series device"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it for work and home. Better and faster than typing, swiping, or tapping out text. Reminds me of my old iPAQ 111. Like the name papyrus way better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am baffled by how many people STILL are amazed when I write on my phone. DOWNLOAD AN APP! like this one! there are a few but this one seems to be without bugs. I wish the screen to show my notes wasn't as big and gaudy and a couple other offers and ends BUT I'm giving 5 stars cuz I CAN WRITE ON MY PHONE! and Squid has never lost my writings (oh, I don't like the name either - I liked the old one better)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Decent ""pen"" effect, paper and ink color choices. Wish I could write in a text box and have it show up smaller, above. Currently, I end up with 15 or so words on a page, given the screen size and inability to shrink what I've written."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But the endless page ""scrolling"" is restricted to two directions: right and bottom. Therefore only four stars..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best for Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app with my Note 5. Great to jot things down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Stillpage scrolling. ......insert.. Should be added... Page scrolling also... Too much cost  that too only with credit card... Then where the other people will go... Plz add netbanking facility"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I use several notebooks, pcs, tablets, and one phone. I purchased the Cloud Backup option believing incorrectly that it would sync my notes between all my devices. It doesn't. It merely backs up each device to Dropbox or Box (no other cloud services are supported). I was unable to even restore a backup from device X onto device Y. Unfortunately, by the time I figured this out I'd already bought the non-refundable Cloud option for each and every device. Shame on me for not running the trial first. Money down the drain. Again. sigh."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When paper met Android !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Used this for over a year. Excellent for small business owners and anyone who is on the move and needs to annotate small docs and push it out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice, clean and simple. I have used several notepad apps and this one works the best so far. Now I only need to figure out how to paste copied text in the notes and it's a 5 star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When moving down-up the canvas, screen update is still slow. Every thing else is great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app.  I was disappointed to see the removal of the former app Papyrus but the features of the revised app are definite improvements.  A must for any Samsung Note device.  PDF support is a great addition.  The option to turn on/off the pressure sensitivity for Samsung S-Pen is helpful if you find the pressure sensitivity of the Note 5 an issue.  I was able to take a few pictures of products on my Note 5, bring the pictures into a note then draw a few comments on the pictures and type / write some additional comments, PDF the entire note and email (or text it) to a few people.  It may not have the organizational abilities of OneNote or Evernote, but it writes smoothly on Note devices and you can incorporate pictures and PDFs into an endless paper where you cannot do this as easily in other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helpful in editing PDF files and write over it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squid manages to walk a fine line between overly complex apps that fall apart and too simple apps that aren't useful. Using it daily for my legal business to take notes. Highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ive tried every alternative I could find and if you're taking scientific notes, lots of equations, deleting, rewriting, etc... this is your app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When I pan it checkers but sometimes it will freeze and I have to close the app to get it working again I have used many different devices and it happens to all of them I have tried this app on HP pro slate 8 and 12 plus Samsung note tab 2014 and note 5 note 4 and tab s I would gladly pay money if this would get fixed as I have already purchased extension packs please fix this as I use this app every day for university"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've found the app highly versatile. It works great for me and I love it."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I never have to look for my notepad..... it's always with me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I started without any addons and loved to take my notes by using this app. Now I bought every premium feature for it and they are really useful - but i think they could be a bit cheaper or bigger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Update 12/15/2015: Since I use this for work, a functioning backup is critical. Unfortunately, the automatic backup and pdf functions (""premium"" features for which I have paid) no longer work once you have accumulated a decent number of notes. Several fixes to this problem have been suggested by users on the Squid feedback website - such as incremental backups - but there is no indication of a plan to implement any solution.  So, if you just want to use it for a few doodles, it's great. But if you actually want something that you can count on, look somewhere else until they fix this issue.   Original: Still needs a few features to be added, but they seem to be pretty responsive to user input - so I expect to see those things implemented eventually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bought a Note 10.1 to upgrade my Tab 10.1 and it is cool but the pen apps weren't intuitive for me.  As it was, i couldn't justify the upgrade.  I was in the process of boxing it up to return it when I found this.  Papyrus is awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best hand written note taking app on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please give us a pen pack and more theme/layouts - all the other apps have it! Also, on my stock unrooted Note5, when my palm rests on the hardware back button, the menu pops up, it's extremely annoying and doesn't happen on the INKredible app. Please fix as I really want to invest in some of your app's other great, solid features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need. awesome work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just think it have to pay for extra tools, a bit too much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Happy to grant five stars after you add new feature to search by text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I can't copy and paste simple text into a document and if I could access the clipboard that'd be great. Allowing access to the clipboard allows you to copy a bunch of things and paste what you want-- no matter what app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Got this for my tablet when it was papyrus. Now an annoying popup for galaxy apps appears every time i try to use it. Get rid of it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can I insert notes between page in PDF?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best solution to work with the Samsung s pen. Annotation, form filling, signing documents and importing PDFs are simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great Application !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app daily for over a year and never had issues until the new update. No idea what the purpose of the update was but it sure ruined this app. It either: freezes, crashes, or only shows parts of the pdf I cant even use the app anymore as this happens everysingle time. I have a samsung note tablet and this is the best app for this tablet please fix it ASAP. thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best in class"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"l downloaded this to see if it would work better than Skitch for Evernote when annotating pdf documents. Needless to say this works heaps better and I am easily able to save my notes in my Evernote notebooks. A bonus for me is that they give you the option to test out the premium features for 2 weeks without commitment to buy. Only request is for an option to copy a note which would be very handy so that I can make editable/ reusable templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app daily for taking notes on presentations, meeting minutes, project plans, and general life notes. The ability to import PDFs, scribble on them, and export them again, is often more useful than the annotation features in Acrobat. My toddler likes to use it for coloring, too. This app is worth the money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Straight forward design, quick and responsive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy to use. Seems to work well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think that this app is extremely versatile and I use it for all of my classes. My notes have never been neater."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It was so usefull for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would give 5 stars if its not because of the way it imported text. There's no wrap... the text just run across page in one long line no matter how long it is! The rest of the app is great otherwise. Shame really. Please fix this and you get 2 more stars from me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"More backup options  and shape features for free please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would really appreciate if we could select background color."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bad waste"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As far as features, it's as straightforward as an actual paper notebook. Open the app, create a notebook, and start writing smoothly and quickly. Erasing, and changing pen color on the fly is neat, as well as the ability to choose stationary (blank, college ruled, wide ruled, etc) per your preference. It truly is an electronic notepad.   Though, it slightly falls short of the accuracy found in apps like Evernote or Handrite Note, lacking the ability to compensate for stroke imperfections to keep what you write looking as close to your actual handwriting as possible. This irks me, but it probably won't bother most."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I got fed up with the terrible s note app. It's so slow to go from grabbing your phone to taking notes. Having to split everything into awkward small pages makes note taking unnecessarily slow. It's slow to load and change pages. This app has none of those problems."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Usual scam.  App might be free, but to access basic functions eg modify pdf's or even use  a highlighter  you have to  pay $ . If it is not free then say this in the beginning"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for a couple of years and love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for PDF editing I use this app solely for editing PDF on a Tablet, and for that it is by far the best option out there. I agree it is kind of expensive (over 10€ for PDF-editing, some extra tools and cloud sync) but it is so worth it if you use it regularly. A non-rectangular lasso and less clumsy way to switch between tools would be greatly appreciated though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than one-note, but please add GDRIVE sync :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd buy this app if we could change the page background color. Otherwise this is the best handwriting notes app I've found."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like what it does.  Though I wish it was possible to import pdfs from  more than just device  storage  or Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have not used paper since I got this app. Already the basic version is fantastic, and the extra content such as Dropbox backup and pdf annotation are well worth the money. The support is also efficient and helpful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's the handwritten note app I keep coming back to but I really want a more polished experience...  PDF markup is limited (e.g. can't rotate a page). Pen tools are OK, but other apps (e.g. Bamboo) make stylus pen strokes look better and more readable. Biggest fault is complete lack of palm rejection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This is a great app for everything note taking, idea dumping, brain doodling, etc. ... and is more intuitive and comfortable to use than the native galaxy Note app. With the galaxy note - write with the pen, select & move with the finger - feature is genius. Currently a little weak in knowledge management feature.  Unfortunately extremely poor cloud/sync feature. You can't sync individual notes between devices. You can only sync the complete database which at 10+ MB is time and bandwidth consuming."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far, the best handwriting application for android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool for taking notes and doing a quick sketches. Stylus rocks! As for the price - nobody is forcing you to pay for the extra functionality. It's a fair market - go find a better stuff for your penny ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good overall. Needs a few features, like save to SD card, ability to list saved pages by titles and response to support questions ( specially for users with paid llicense). Works best with Samsung ­ Note Tablet ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall a very nice app, vector based, quick and precise. No full screen mode can be annoying, if you wanna use the pen and not touch anything else, but the worst thing is the lack of a real lasso selection, as this one turns into a rectangular shape depending on the dimensions of your lasso and selects things you actually didn't tell it to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love it. I just haven't used It enough to give it five stars. So far It is good and I'm planning On getting the paid Version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but the addons are way overpriced"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for Galaxy Note. I use it every day for work. I have purchased all premium features, because it simply worth the price.Keep up the good work. One drawback is that there should be a sync option. I use Windows 8.1 tablet and I can't sync data back and forth."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like the app better than other drawing apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app to take notes for vet school, and it's fantastic. Saves on printing out notes, so many options on what you can do to the presentations. It's been a life saver! I highly recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The feature I enjoy the most is the infinite canvas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Looks really good, very much like PDF markups. But on Note the tile window icon is just where the + sits at bottom right. Only way is to reduce size of window then tap + then maximise.  Takes shine off use. Contacted developers but not received answer. Recent updates still same.2 updates and still no fix for Samsung Note devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has good pen features, and nice vector rendering. Good for stylized drawing or diagramming. 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Basic features have to be paid for cant even erase part of a stroke without forking out £2.30 for a proper eraser and some basic tools you dont really need. No fullscreen option,annoying toolbars that are permanently there so you have to be carefull not to touch them while writing, horrible Touchwiz wannabe app theme. IAP are 2.30 + 3.99 + 2.30 = around £9 really greedy devs (charging for an eraser) Try lecture notes instead only £2.80 one off payment does pretty much everything this does except casting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Es buena pero no se sincroniza con la nube"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"NEVER HAVE I  EVER BEEN SO FRUSTRTED WITH AN APP. THE WAY THIS THING WRITES IS RIDICULOUS. CANT EVEN PICK UP HALF OF WHAT IM WRITING NO MATTER HOW FREAKING SLOW I WRITE. NOT FUN. THE QUALITY OF THE WRITING? NEGATIVE POINTS. SO BAD THAT IF I COULD GIVE THIS APP A 0 I WOULD. HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED. JUST SAVE YOURSELVES."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I can write here physics formulas."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for those who use s pen but keep pressing the back button. This app disable the button while writing on a note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good app, it is recommended for people who loves to write at hand,  draw for notes and write study notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its a good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it works great very intuitive and no need to buy pens or gimmicks.  5 stars if I could change the color scheme not a fan of the off blue border.  Would also be great if the lines mirrors the border colors such as a deep purple or fully adjustable color scheme option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish you could type though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its works so well on my tablet. Im currently usining it for everything. Taking notes ,studiying even opening PDF misic worksheets its great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love squid! However I'd also really love to see a couple of changes. Specifically being able to change font when using text tool, and instead of the text box that appears when typing text, the text is written directly onto the note, so you can see when to hit return to make it fit!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good. Five stars when: 1) continuous page without the horizontal scroll/zoom 2) pick some selected pen colors from multiple icons in the bar and not just from clicking on the color icon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Forget the Samsung writing app. This is ready to use and organize! Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app does not provide an overflow button to access it's menu, nor does a long press on the keys call up any such menu. For that reason I cannot link my active stylus with the app! Major drawback!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been testing list apps that I could use to make lists and take notes and all of them had problems or had too many bs features.   This is now my go to solution rather than 100 pieces of paper.  Only down side is the name sucks and takes up two lines on my desktop and I don't really care what it used to be called."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The nicest handwritten note app for Android. For devices with an S-pen, this is a wonderful app. It's better than the default Samsung note taking app that comes included on Note devices. There are a lot of options even in the free version. Organizing notes is simple so it's easy to find your work later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if this wonderful app had a favorite pen quick select like S Note. Maybe it can be added?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It took some getting used to... Since then it's been such a pleasure to write down notes using squid. Ability to edit pdf is amazing and very useful. If you have an S - pen you will never use pen and paper again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would personally like a calligraphy brush to be added and multiple ways to backup but otherwise it works out fine and export is nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use for PDF edit, good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I've been long time user and the app has definitely improved over time. I needed the cloud backup and the extra tool set which is kind of costly for the features it provides separately. Will purchase if I get both in one, or as a complete package on play store within a price budget of 2$"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Tried multiple times to save (jpeg) one format, they get saved but don't show up in gallery!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"...pls"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"NICE!!!..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"please, add a feature such that blank notes aren't saved."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is just the most handy app! I use it every day & gave several notes in progress most of the time. I can't recommend it enough!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs a copy function,  and charge for individual features rather than one free to unlock everything.   Great for school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Sign docs on the go. Modify docs on the go. Lovely app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just awesome!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app out there!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it daily as a main notebook, and I like it !! keep going."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recommend it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have my app set up to export pdfs to dropbox. This is convenient so that I can view my notes on other devices. The issue is that every time it exports every note (250+ notes) instead of just the edited notes. This process takes 5-10 minutes and really slows down my tablet, sometimes freezing it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please add transparency option for images and ROUND eraser shape! Also having an option for rotating shapes would be really appreciated :-) many thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'd like developers improve it a little more but so far so good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the killer app for galaxy note. If you have a note you have to get this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Honestly, this app is the best notetaking app I've ever used. I've bought a lot of features because of how useful everything is. It allows a lot of customization - definitely a lot better than S-Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It would be awesome if I could create folders or something like that for my notes... I am taking notes for several classes and it gets harder and harder to find the right one again... Otherwise I love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Its ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just needs synchronization across devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app! I use it constantly for a variety of things, from working Khan Academy problems to shopping lists. Export the pdfs to my journal in Evernote. My only recommendation would be ""one click to an eraser"" vs having to change the pen to white and then use it as an eraser. Some other apps have this feature, but I'm just accustomed to this as my ""go to"" hand writing app...would give five stars for this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works really well - helps me keep me notes organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quality work! Thank you!."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung Note4, no problems, love the grid notes print good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything I ever wanted!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Many features not available in free version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I had an issue that kept me from using the app. I contacted support, they determined the cause was a feature of the custom ROM I was using (an LCD DPI change) and instead of telling me that they didn't support that sort of thing, an update came that resolved the problem. They were very responsive and I'm quite pleased with the experience. The program is also great, which is why I cared enough to contact support in the first place. Thanks, devs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Serves me well enough need better cross device updating"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app serves its purpose (easy to use, navigate, etc), is stable (no glitches or crashes thus far - in use for approx 30 days) but would love the ability to change background colour to help reduce eye strain, as well as easily export final doc(s) to PDF when so desired."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add preview pages please! I want to see small contents rather than just page numbers. It make it hard for me to find the info i need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Affords easy access w/lots of tools to explore. No glitches so far. High marks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for taking notes on PDFs. Would like to see the ability to edit word and ppt files though!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus helps in taking notes in class......... I advise all students and business people to download.................😁😀😊☺❤❤👍👍👍👏👏"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Second screen work's with a Chromecast! Very happy again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"+1, I then retract my comment.   May try it again when I need it again  ...   thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Somple, easy and reliable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app offers very useful tools (like the shapes tool). And it has the possibility to lock the zoom which I love and I NEED (SNote doesn't have that). The only blemish is that I really liked how realistic the handwriting was in SNote while in Squid the lines still look a bit rugged (if this is the right word). Otherwise, a nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I hv a rooted Note 3 with Action Memo somehow removed.. This app feels like a perfect alternative"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for taking a lot of notes and exporting them. Some couple of improvements: (1) apply page settings to all pages. (2) needs more shortcuts such as ""cut and paste"". (3) widgets! E.g for a preview, lock screen memo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does the job brilliantly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, but the sensitivity is a little lacking. But I still love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Made it possible for me to at last abandon using pen and paper!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a good app but it can be much better with a few improvements.  The handwriting feature is great and feels almost as good as writing on a piece of paper.   Being able to import and export pdf documents is a great feature and is the main reason I got this app instead of using the Samsung app that came with the note.   What needs to to be added is the ability to create notebooks within notebooks."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Why isn't there cross device support? I'd like to write a note on my tablet and be able to see it on my phone later when I'm not home. Also when I write using my active stylus it comes out very edgy."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app on my Note10.1(2014).  I'm half way through my Electrical Engineering degree, and I take all of my notes on this app, and then export them for the rest of the class to use.  Feature Requests: 1) Google Drive integration.   - I maintain all of my class documents through Google Drive, and right now I have to manually export each note to drive.  Along that same theme....  2) Export Notebooks/Batch export - as it is right now I have to open the note, open the menu and export for every single note.  I really wish I could long press on a note/notes and export, as well as being able to long press on a notebook title and export.  3) Sub-notebook/folder organization -as I said, I use this for all my classes, which means I have a notebook for each class, but I've subdivided them further into notes folders for each class, homework folders for each class, as well as personal projects, to do lists, grocery list, sketches, etc....  I really really really need subfolders or a filebrowser and just have them organized on my flashcard/google drive.  4) Quick symbol drop down 5)LaTeX interpreter/math drop down menu.  would pay for plugin"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Your handwriting will come out messy and it's a pain to get anything written down. Android stock photo app already lets me write on photos, which is all this app is really good for. Uninstalled!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'd still like to see better/automatic syncing between devices. Being able to set a palm-rest area would also be nice."

All trials.. talk about annoying...hope this gets a quick resolution...after all there is a reason I bought and used this app for the last 9 months"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A simply superb app....I can take notes anywhere and anytime ....no need to carry pen and paper with me always........... I loved it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the best app works with s pen ever, and its a very good planning app, but pls give me freedom to change page backgroung color pls pls pls"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for making note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for note taking on limitless sized paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was a pure pen and paper note taker but the notebooks and binders of slides were piling up. I made the decision to go to digital note taking and I appreciate the pen and paper feel that Squid offers. Squid is extremely easy to use and has quickly become my most used app! Love how it allows me to upload my professor's slides and write, type, and draw everywhere. No more binders and I export everything to my Google drive so I can free up my device storage. Good work, Squid people."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"When I swipe (move) around the screen, it tends to jump, or snap back to the previous view. The best example is that the page is almost on a rubber band. Great function otherwise."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for note-taking!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Searched and tried many apps until I used squid. Multiple notebooks and default letter size paper makes it the best!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Literally don't make paper notes anymore,  even for school it's easy to organize  ""books and binders""  of notes for specific topics or courses"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this everyday for taking notes during meetings. The way it writes I feel I am just writing on a paper pad. Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works flawlessly on my new zenpad s 8.0 with the Z stylus. It recognises the pressure, palm rejection and buttons. Amazing! It is a giant improvement over the built-in note taking app. I rarely give 5 stars and leave a written review, but this app deserves my praises"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it but so much room for improvement. Especially text handling, NOTE SEARCH and a LIST VIEW!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have tried several handwritting note apps, and Squid ((formerly Papyrus) is the best out of the bunch.   I like Squid better then the in-built S-Note. (If you are using Note 8, you can download the improve S-Note).   Other handwritting Apps each have their strenghts and weaknesses, but for me Squid  stands out from the best. I    hope they do improve the software. For instance, I like INKredible which wins out on the smoothness of its handwritting and the background template.       Wishlist:   1. Page template e.,g. Diary Template (similar to INKredible)  2. Ability to copy from Samsung clipboard (ie. to select from web site and paste)  3. Smooth handwritting  4. Tool Pallette easily available rather then going into a sub-menu. 5. I choose the A4 papersize. However, when you zoom-in-out. It changes  your choose papersize from A4 to infinite, which is very naughty. 6. I can't insert a page before page one. 8. Everything I add a new page, I have to keep changing the page setting e.g. size to A4 and blank page. Why can't it default to what I want?. 9. Add image, give you lots of ways to add an image, but wish there was a dedicated 'add image from camera'."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and create notes...better than the other apps in this category"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I do love the app, it's great for note taking and sketching. My only gripe is since the name change and update it's ditched the premium features I purchased in app. Ever wish you hadn't deleted those confirmation emails..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would get 5 stars if we could sync across devices ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs the ability to backup to Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice option but writing with larger fingers is a challenge."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app,  I hope it will come with more drawing and painting tool for the next release ...  I want to buy it all :)..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"thankyou"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Actually, brilliant, I can insert my pre scanned signature into a pdf, thanks! Just a minor hiccup, my scanned PNG with transparent background comes solid black in zoom part, but, is OK when pasted."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent handwriting app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best handwriting note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it very much. Wish to have more out of it in future updates. like flip of Pages.......background layout etc. Well done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's great for writing. Simple to use and stuff like finger erase is great. The pen movement is smooth. Excellent  and 5 stars if you just want to write your notes on screen instead of paper. But needs more to be a complete note taking app which truly uses the power of digital ink. Like  handwriting to text conversion, sync with ever note, tags, and handwriting search. Especially some form of search.Hope to see such features on this as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"note taking made easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Developer took time to resolve Google Play conflicts in favor of getting the issue resolved rather then his pocket.  This app is the only one out there that is looking at how we use Android Devices to optimize them for better note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great PDF reading/note-taking experience for the Samsung tablet with S Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app is better than S note because you can erase with your finger. looking at you, galaxy Note user"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have zero complaints about this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for school to take notes and I think it's great!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than a basic notebook app and far easier than a more complicated app such as ever note. Perfect for writing lists, notes and even sketches. This is wonderful for every day use and the in purchase tool kit is totally worth it. For three dollars, it's much cheaper than a nice paper notebook too. Highly recommend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Paid for this feature but doesn't always work. Often after writing over the pdf, after exporting only the edit shows, sometimes produces a blank document if opened by other pdf apps, only works if opened by this app. Not useful if you're sending the file to someone else and they need the same app to open a supposedly universal format. Ended up using a FREE app to do something this app couldn't do after paying for the pdf export feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Wrote a long note and went to change page size, nothing was hidden, it wiped the page and now the info is lost. This guy can go to hell."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There is a problem in exporting the note as pdf format and share it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It does a great job on what it's designed to do. The only gripe that I have with this is when I compare it to the stock note taking app on the Note 10.1 2014 edition. The app is able to smooth out the wording once you lift up the S-pen from the screen. The notes on this app can get very ugly if you aren't writing when you're zoomed in to an extreme extent. Other than that, it is a great alternative!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great work, but drive cloud backup would make it perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"clean master detect this app frequently restarting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For taking notes in lectures (university) and revision, this is by far the best app I've used!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App especially with the add ons.  Love the split window function on note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app sucks you have to buy everything and its not easy to write on...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"STARTED TO USE IT IMMEDIATELY AND HAVEN'T STOPPED USING IT"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Seriously?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In short, i love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a student and frequent note taker! Samsug Galaxy Note pro is my primary device and Squid is my go to note-taking tool!  I used to take notes with s note but squid has changed everything! It's easy and really simple yet very very effective!  My only issue is the pencil tool! I wish the developer would add the pencil tool as it would be a real help!  Otherwise it's 5 out of 5!!!!!! Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Everything that is good about this app has been said but why it does not have the simplest search capability? At least we should be able to search the title of our notes!!!!!!!! I think it is a major flaw!!!! Please please consider adding search capabilities."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Is a great tool, but is lacking a few things to be amazing, some sort of way to type,  to chance handwritten to text,  or add more space to write when you import pdfs, as well as the lack of some things such as a precise selection tool, or a favorite palette for tools configurations... and so on,  but is in the right path."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has weened me off legal pads completely. Only thing missing is backup to Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Easy to use.  One of my favorites."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Has some serious backing up problems, atleast with dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is very good apps, but when your notes start to pile up, to search the note I need it is not an easy task."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple pen based. Just does the job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It requires a bit of tinkering to set it up just the way you want, but the end result is worth it! There does need to be support for syncing notes from one device to another though. This is crucial for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Squids are amazing, and this app is almost as amazing, like 27% as amazing as real squids: 5/5"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb and Easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best program I've found for pdf annotation. I use it with all my class notes.   The only improovement I can think of is when choosing pen size, have the option to set favourite sizes. I like to use different size lettering when I am writing text, writing section titles, and drawing diagrams. Using the slider is great, but having the option to quickly switch brush sizes would be highly useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app was great before, but when I got the add on to mark up PDFs, it took it to a whole other level. The PDF reader works so good in fact, that I now use it as my default PDF reader, because it renders mechanical drawings faster than any other reader. The only thing I would add to this app now would be a few wingdings. If you have a Note or a Note Pro, I consider this must-have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I have been using Evernote to take notes in my classes, but this is much easier to hand write notes. Would like it if tools such as shapes and the eraser were included in the app, but can do without. Loving it so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app on my Samsung Note 10.1 but I do wish there was Google Drive support. Other than that I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"They is plenty of room for one more icon. Make it the eraser, and it's 5 stars from me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With how easy it is to import and write on pdfs, and how seamless note-taking is I absolutely love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app I found for marking up pdf files and just takin b notes in general.!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Simple in use, responsive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has fast response time between when I move my stylus and when the mark appears. Really awesome to see something that supports the DirectStylus; the automatic palm rejection, writing naturally with pressure response, AND being able to quickly erase something with my finger makes for a streamlined experience. Great work!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No out of the box keyboard typing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Very slow writing on Z4 tablet. Misses parts of letters as you're writing which is a pretty key feature of a note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I need this on my iphone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is a minimalist alternative to apps like Evernote or OneNote. Sometimes you just want to write something down quickly without navigating through multiple screens, logging into an account or generating a unique format document like a checklist. Squid is perfect when you need paper and don't have any but you have your smart phone. Its interface is sexy and highly intuitive. I've been looking for something like this for a while. Papyrus came close but it wasn't as sleek and the pages were hard to keep sized correctly. This redesign, complete with the coolest logo ever, make me smile. I hope Squid doesn't try to compete with other note apps by adding more and more distracting features over time. This app is worth way more than it's premium package price in its current state."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I Love it Just wisn it Would let you Open more than one document at a time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love this app and all the features and tools that it comes with. The only problem I have is that it lags whenever my notes fill up. When I first start a note it works perfectly, but then as I fill it up, it becomes very glitchy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"So far this is the best note taking app perfect to work with s-pen in terms of performance. However, some more features need to be added. Only then this would be 5 star note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best way to backup your class notes. Does it automatically to your dropboxmafter the payment and setup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could you look in to a password protected option for the journals? I am currently using this app as a therapy journal and I'd feel a lot more secure knowing I could lock up my entries from prying eyes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Desperately needs clipboard integration, pics or text from textbooks. Also palm guard, don't limit scrolling zooming to fingertips causes ERRATIC zooming scrolling while writing notes. Add/fix this then 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for quick notes mostly. Like paper,  it's great for doodling when you should be taking notes :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"If you've changed your DPI settings, the handwriting and eraser effects will apply inches away from where the actual tip of your stylus is. Evernote, OneNote, Smart Note, Sketchbook,  and Quill do not have this limitation. If you could make your app respect user defined DPI settings it'd be worth 5 stars because it really does work well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would like it to work more easily with text,  being able to copy text and edit it in my notes. I would also like an easier way to copy pictures into my notes.  For example using my spen I can easily grab part of my screen,  but to put it into a note I first have to save it as a bitmap file and then import it into squid. Finally,  there should be an option to post-process the images captured by the camera in the way that camera scanner does. The contrast is increased so that the text of the picture of a paper note has maximum visibility on the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"After several month I gave Squid a try and I do not regret. The infinite page is brilliant idea and works well. Also, Squid is much smoother than S Note (e.g. it creates new page or save note instantly). The price of addins is acceptable - I use tools and cloud (for PDF annotation, I prefer XODO). I was thinking about five stars but I am missing quick eraser tool (i.e. icon on the right-top bar) much. I use Squid mainly for handwritten notes using spen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One stop best of notes app in former :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It beats everthing compare to other apps. It is better if developer adding more templates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think this app is great.  I am focusing this review/comment specificly on the pdf addon.  This app hands down is the best app that I have used so far for annotating and highlighting pdf's!!!  Im using it on a galaxy note 8 and I can highlight just like a regular book with the s pen.  The problem though is the actual ""pdf reading"" experience leaves much to be desired.  Like searching within a pdf, going directly to a page number, bookmarking.  Over all I like the pdf addon, it just needs a few upgrades."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Handwriting is great! Taking notes is a breeze! Scrolling pages need to be better. Two finger tap for page scrolling would be nice. Biggest issue: when I export PDFs, annotated text will not show on other PDF viewers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The basic work flow is great. It's simple and quick to use and I would recommend it especially for anyone with a galaxy note device. There are just a couple of things I wish it had. 1. You should be able to set a default page layout for each notebook. Just as an example, I like the graph paper for math but lined for other things. 2. When I use a notebook widget shortcut it just loads the first notebook instead of the notebook I've chosen. 3. It would be great if there was an integrated sound recorder. 4. An option to type stuff like Microsoft one note would be nice. Like the ability to do bullets and numbered lists. Right now I have to manage a jumble of evernote notebooks and papyrus notebooks. I want to have everything in papyrus haha. Edit = the app keeps crashing for no reason. I've tried restarting my tablet and everything. For an app that I've spent money on, this should not be happening. Please fix it soon :( reinstalling the app fixed the issue, but I lost all my notes because box backup wasn't working."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love that I can adjust settings to my preferences!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have download almost every app lije tus one but undoubtly ths is the best"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I always use this app in my lecture classes because it can import pdf file. Help me take note easier!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really wish I had this in pharmacy school, it would've made note taking so much better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've purchased several note taking programs with plenty of bells and whistles.  This app is intuitively easy to use for making notes and notebooks.  I use it for ""To Do"" lists, shopping lists, pick up lists etc. Also cursive finger writing works much better than stylus writing and the results are just as quick as using paper - a big plus. When I capture an idea in the middle of the night, this is my ""go to"" app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"In PDF I would only change the way hand written text looks when exported its not that clear as seen when written looks like a pen that ran out of ink"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just installed it - can't find advertised ""Cast"" feature?!?! After reading features for several similar apps, installed this one because of Cast advertisement, to only discover that it isn't there. If it is supported, please let me know how to find it; otherwise remove misadvertised feature. Giving 1 star for now, but willing to change it to 5 if one of the mentioned actions are taken (to be fare to developer, the app is well written)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent just wished that it showed notebooks and not random notes unsorted."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The simplicity of it makes it a everyday use application. Not sure how you can improve on something that needs no improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Runs well on Galaxy S3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was originally using Adobe to take my notes in class, and felt restricted on how I could take my notes with colors, sizes of pen, etc. The app works great and I love that it syncs  up to Dropbox automatically so I know my notes are safe! Having an option for Google drive be awesome though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"you can see the zig zag lines in straight lines make the pen to draw smooth lines like other handwritten apps do"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Hello! I seldom write review but your product is truly amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ham"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"i give 4 star, because i still have to pay in order to use eraser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I use this for notes in university. Just writing or taking extra notes on the pdfs of the slides that the prof uses. Cloud backup means I dont have to worry if my phone breaks down, I still have access to all my notes. A night visual option would be great for battery life, but otherwise its awesome! Saved me money on getting a laptop for school. Thanks team!   Edit-it has a serious problem with the backup. Don't use it for important things. They do no mean to fix it anytime soon as far as I know."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost Perfect! I like that I can import and export in PDF format. The app seems a little sluggish at times when scrolling through PDFs but it is nothing major. I just wish that the app would maintain the embedded Bookmarks in the PDF upon exporting it to the cloud."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favourite Note App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app.  Enables me to totally utilize the features of the note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for quite a while now. This app is indeed a great one but also has it's flaws. For some reason, writing with the S-pen does not seem to be as smooth with some other apps like Onenote, even though the general experience is much better with Squid. It would be wonderful if this was worked on for an upcoming update. Furthermore, it would be an added plus to have margins included to the ruled lines for the page types. This would make it look more like a notebook, and I think make it more welcoming to new users (my own opinion). An option to save to Google Drive would also be welcome. Great app. Well done guys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can't flip to turn pages in PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can you add a magnifier like in iOS notability  app so we don't have to zoom in and out to write on the pages. Also a hand tool would be nice so you can scroll with one finger. And scrolling up and down  instead of sideways on imported documents and PDFs would do wonders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App.Much better than Samsung Note. But I'm Afraid there are some Simple but bad problems.  1)You can't save your note files anywhere!Unless export them!And when you export them you can't change them any more!  2)You can't make file in the app.So abstraction is out of picture.  3)The in-app purchases are a little bit expensive.  4)You can't do the Continuous rolling on your notes! (As you could easily use width-fit and write your notes.)  At the end I have to say it's a great app, but there are some easy to solve problems that we hope the developers would pay attention to them in their future updates.  At the end I suggest this app. to all the Galaxy note users!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But this app is simply the best for note taking on the note 10.1 2014.  In my experience, the pen tracking in this app is significantly better than LectureNotes which is what all my professors use for some reason."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"When typing a text, the app does not automatically change lines so the text goes beyond the page. Also, there are no formatting options at all (bold,  italic, font size, colour etc). The typing feature must be revised in general in order to be usable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If moleskin was more forward thinking they works have made this app. Does almost everything I do with small notebooks with the advantage of better organization."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's amazing and better than S note IMO"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Close to perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome integration with the Samsung Galaxy Note products. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Favorite and most used app on my Note 12.2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its useless you should buy the ability to write on pdf files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I want to give you money, but you wont let me! has been happening since I got it. I can access other IAPs from other apps fine."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"But when will you developers realized that not everyone is comfortable with putting their data on the cloud on a server in Tibet. There are so many other options for data storage that keeps the information under the control of the owner.  We pay for the app let us decide where and how we store our data.  Its just as easy to design the app to allow us to save to a network device and save close and reopen a file note stop playing with us"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like it so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazingly good app. So much better than lecture notes and s note. Especially my favourite part about this app is that you can import infinite numbers of pdf files. Get it you won't regret"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I originally bought Papyrus. Twice...it crashed and erased EVERYTHING in my folders. I didn't complain. I just re-downloaded all of it. Now...the name has changed and it requires me to buy AGAIN to have PDF access. Once more...I have lost everything! No more!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"squid is very good for writing notes. However, it lacks some major features. For instance, no synching between devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Background: I came from IOS on an ipad mini and iphone, this app replaced Notability... Almost.   The Good: Drawing features are excellent. Love the touch sensitivity built into the stylus of the note. Differentiating stylus input from finger input is so great. I can draw with the stylus, and if needed, zoom in with my fingers, draw a marquee around an object it with my finger to select it, and then scale, copy, move or delete with no tool chagning. I bought all the add-on's after the free trial period without even hesitating. They're all  extremely useful. Although, to be fair, a little expensive. In most cases, it's easy to manipulate images from other apps through sharing and/or opening into squid/papyrus.    The Bad: Editing text... aweful. Some bugginess on the widgets loosing their names in a folder for shortcuts and infinite screen size creates issues where the screen stops recognizing finger inputs at the system level, not application level. The backup features NEEDS to be able to use the same file on multiple devices.   I would replace this with notibility if I could for the improved text, backup, and cloud features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good note-taking app. Pdf function could be improved (suggest to add bookmarks on pdf pages with notes. It can be hard to find if the document is long.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's nearly perfect but it doesn't have the option that lets you confirm whether you want to save changes. Add this and it'll be absolutely perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to move the screen manually? This ruins the whole idea of infinite canvas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Booyah, booyah bootah.  Bam booyah babooyah boo.  Booyah babooyah boobabooyah.  Boobooboobooyah!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. Incredibly versitile while remaining simple and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm on the galaxy note and this app replaced paper for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good application. Much faster and much more stable than SNote. A sync feature accross various devices and platforms would be an advance."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love using this app with my Samsung S-pen devices.  It's actually better than S-note in almost every way except one:  Squid does not sync  across devices.  That would definitely make it 5-star.  Also, I really appreciate the feedback from the developer; they obviously care about continuing to improve the app and it sounds like they hope to include syncing functionality someday."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything  you could need to take good college notes. Must have for any college kid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could use more features. Easier opinion to type for instance. Aside from that great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Squid works very well on my LG 4. It doesn't work so well on my Yoga Pro 2 & I paid for the pdf option twice, hence the 1 star removal.  I'm not sure if it's because of the recent transition to (W10) Windows 10 - which MS has to fix ASAP because it's so buggy - but Squid (or W10) won't download my pdf's so that I can do my homework in tablet mode.  I use this app to work out equations outside of class. It saves me time and paper, which is a plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best handwriting apps, but it has just 2 deficiencies, smoothing the words written and locking the notes. But still I love it :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a dozen apps for taking hand written notes in meetings. This is the best. Bamboo is prettier, but more for creative work. Squid is the most organized and the easiest to use. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried many PDF markup apps and this is by far the best I have used!!  Great to use for both notetaking, studying and any form of natural markups using the S Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"1. No automatic uploading in jpeg format. PDFs cannot be ocr scanned. 2. It looks wrong when you scroll on a page. Otherwise this would be a 5 star!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No longer works with Samsung multiwindow."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I gotta say, the latest update has made this app so much better. Great job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Drive backup needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Important Features are paid-uninstalled"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the notebooks and pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The features allow me to write and edit anywhere. I can map out scenes and even sketch mock up illustrations."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome notepad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really loved this squid papyrus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using a Samsung Note Pro 12.2, rooted and on CyanogenMod 12.1.  Didn't like the limitations of KNOX, TouchWiz, and regular Android.  This meant losing a good program, though - Samsung's S-Note.  There are apps that make up for that, and Squid is the key part.  Excellent ink, good use of cloud, even better use of local storage (the main reason I flashed CM12.1).  I am a presenter/teacher and love being able to show Squid notes and drawing via Chromecast - a wonderful combination.  I don't use the PDF import (yet - thinking about it), but love the premium tool pack."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But I wish it would select the content of the pdf to cat and paste in the doc or other apps eg Snote. Pretty good otherwise!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only way to take notes! Love the new version even more than the old!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can't use the stylus the moment my hand touches the screen. Can't take notes with hand hanging in the air."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for 2 years. It is a lot better than s note but i need synchronization features to be able to use it on 2 devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"&gt; 5 *"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been using almost daily on the Note 10.1 2014 since release and have bought all extra features. Would love to be able to backup to Google Drive instead of Dropbox. Also, an extra pen similar to the one in INKredible would be nice, but please keep the current one also!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the only app I've seen with such a quick erasing tool. Saved me ton of time from having to click on the eraser button.   Some great features to add would be searchable handwriting and automatic handwriting to text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would get 5 stars if it integrated with OneDrive where the rest of my work is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Anything useful is hidden behind a premium version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs Google Drive support. Love all the features and the fact you can move text and objects, unlike in OneNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"But at least it works and didn't crash in the 10 minutes I used it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this all the time to jot down things I need to remember.  It is quick and easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But some of the PDFs does not show properly, is that the problem of lack of fonts? Could u please consider solving this problem, I can provide u the PDF samples. BTW, it would be great if u can provide djvu importing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I can talk to a client on my phone and scrawl notes/annotate stuff here and it keeps it all filed for me. Can't believe I had a tablet pc for a year & didn't use this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Pretty good app. Would rate much higher if it had a share option. Sure you can export and then share. But..... Why!?!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, works well. Couple of additional features would be good... Swipe to scroll for PDFs and live file editing rather than import / export."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"To stay well organized, all I use is Google Calendar and Squid! Squid is so simple easy and fast to use. Its more powerful features make me even more efficient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great stuff"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool and wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Edit: By any name this rose is sweet.   Best thing about papyrus is that the developers do work on this app. I think the new way ro move notes is great! Like your drop shadow under the round plus button makes it visible great design balance"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super helpful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can't scroll through pages with a finger swipe"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for taking and organising notes. The layout is very easy to navigate and has some brilliant features such as importing and exporting files. You can also annotate powerpoints which is very useful for university. 5/5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be awesome if there was a ""full screen mode"" to hide the OS buttons (back button, home button, etc.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the main reason I like my Note Pro 12.2 tablet. I use this program more than I use any other. It turns your S pen into a real working tool! Great job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Always room to improve."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My favorite note application. Add the possibility to assign labels to documents and I will give you five stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what i needed. Now i can enjoy taking my galaxy note to class for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with my samsung tablet ☺"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than S-Note built in app from Samsung!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love that you can create a note with as large a size your device can handle. It allows you to freely note the ideas without cramping up the page. App is very simple to use. The author asks for ideas on his website and actually implemented requests of users.IMHO Samsung should preinstall it on every Galaxy Note device.Its a special treat for stylus lovers.Remembers its about noting down ideas, not complex art.  Google launched Playstore Vouchers in my country, and this is the first app i spent my money on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need sub folders for organizing my notes. One level does not do it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"There are a number of free tools that are just plain and simply easier and better than this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I couldn't get the pencil line to keep up and it doesn't have all of the things it says it has"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great app that works like a charm. I use it to keep charts to manage my diabetes, for notes at client locations and for lists. I have two of the three paid plugins and wow, they are great.  The thing is, there is no way to duplicate documents. In other words, no Save As feature, and this is a killer. I do hope they add it soon. Another thing that is really needed is access to the same docs over multiple devices. I understand this second feature is a lot to ask for, but sometimes I have one device but not the other and not being able to get at my stuff harshes my app buzz. I will definitely recommend this to others. If you have a tablet with a pen, this is the app you've been waiting for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great piece of software. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This is my second semester using this app. It's okay. It struggles with pdf documents that are over 30 pages long and causes the app to crash. The app crashes too often as it is. I like being able to export my notes to my google drive. Improvements that need to be made is to let you import other file formats such as power points and word documents for editing. Not just pdf files. There should also be a feature where the screen shifts for you when you get to the end of the screen when you write with a stylus.  Notability carries these features for ipad users. Squid/papyrus needs to do the same so it can keep up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for editing pdf and adding signatures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am an engineer and professor and Squid makes my jobs a breeze!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"You can't see more than one page from the notebook browser, so if you keep lots of pages in a note, vs los of individual note, this month be problematic. I personally like fewer notes,more pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I bought the premium version for papyrus - why do I need to re-buy features I already had before?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Truly amazing app - a must have for people who want a powerful note-taking app, specially if you have a note device ( I have the Note 12.2) and it is very fluid, i definitely recommend it. Another app i recommend for people who like this app is LectureNotes which is highly customizable. Bamboo is a decent app but lacks the features of Squid/Papyrus or LectureNotes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The clipboard is not shared, so you cannot paste an image or something else into a note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Can we get a new selection of pens? Like a calligraphy pen?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"If I write 5 letters at straight fine, but when i erased 1 letter the 5 letters gone...!!!   Why...?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall this app is amazing. Everything sync to my Dropbox and it has a highlight option now. One thing I am hoping for is the page preview, or an easier swipe. Something so I don't have to keep hitting one button, or know what page to go to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Some features are rough around the edges like the textbox doesn't update as you type, also very limited capability with other apps. Its needs some work to make it completely user friendly and intuitive to use. A major plus is the infinitely large paper very cool to note entire textbooks on one piece of paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic has made life a lot easy, thank you so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"YOU WERE A KID BUT NOW YOU'RE A SQUID."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works really well. Worth premium"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has all the features I need for good display of notes for students and import/export of pdf."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For note taking it is just breath taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love it.  update - ahhhhhhhhh squid?! Why?  2 star penalty!.... returned to 5 star after name change explanation... getting used to the fish."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But writing could use a smoothing option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app.very useful..need some improvement like color customization,tool enhancement,lighter version and etc..but thanks to dev team,great job guys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helps me allot with my school... Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bought the Note 8 for is note taking capabilities, and the S Pen which is the best tablet pen around. I I thought I would be stuck with S Note forever, since not even Evernote makes use of the pressure feature. And Autosketch detects both the pen and my skin. This ha so far been good, and has box and Dropbox utilities too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple, user-friendly, use it a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Used squid (formerly papyrus)when I had my galaxy note 10.1 and again now with my note 4 and the experience on both was great! The premium features are a bit pricey though..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Between this and LNotes.. I use them both, each good at something but this app i unbeatable when it comes to marking up engineering drawings in PDF. Tryed all apps with my S-pen, this one wins over all. Will get 5 stars when I am able to export selected pages to PDF, not whole notebook. And- ability to sync to local folder on SD card, so that I can sync any way I want."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for a tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So helping me to draw anything i need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great APP! Easy to use and fun! I don't carry around pad and paper anymore.  All I need is my phone. It really is that good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But I'm disappointed cause I can't write on the tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The people spoke, the devs answered! Thanks for the great update!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Litterally the best app for note taking in college."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Might be an isolated incident but I didn't get a chance to use it ever since they switch to squid. Fiinote is better for me. I wish I get refund"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for on the fly note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful.  I can actually solve long calculus problems just like if I was writing on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I bought the upgraded ""Tool Pack"" because the note taking feature is great. I take notes on the fly whenever I want to save something important to refer to it later. The upgrade is well worth it. Highly recommend to everyone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like it however I would really like to have tag/label feature on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Glad to see this app still being maintained with new features being added."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it . . !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the better for notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Your app is so great I like it so much but I want it to have at leasr 3slot of pen so that I can change form or tool easier and quicker while I'm listening to lecturer in college"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It jeopardize hate towArds writing..................now I love writing.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it almost every day. Never got into the Samsung software that came with any of my Note phones. This was automatically easier and more intuitive to use. Edit: updating my review over 2 years later. Even though the name isn't is cool as it once was (Papyrus) I e-mailed the developer playfully griping about it, and they actually took the time to answer my silly e-mail. These folks are classy no matter what the app is called. Get it. Use it. Give them money for an amazing all. I did."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love using this with my Note 4. Syncs beautifully with Dropbox, wish it synced with Evernote too but exporting works fine too. Love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd rate 5stars if you change back...the new one really looks like crap."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I thought I would give this another try and update my review, but nothing seems to have changed. As others have pointed out the s-pen side bottom still isn't working. I verified this again with my Galaxy Not 10.1 2014 edition. Premium features were nice, but very overpriced for what you get."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I like the app but...there is no support for the Samsung Galaxy S II. While I'm stuck on this device, I would greatly appreciate if you could support the Galaxy S II"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for pdf writing yet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using this for some time. This is a solid app that goes beyond expectations. The new update is the cherry on top"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for a long time and it has gotten better and better. Very useful and simple to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use as note10.1  1st generation . i like it .perfect app for note like paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I liked this app at first. It did the job it was supposed to. It wasn't perfect- the toolbar is really crampt and you can't edit page order- but it did it's job. Recently, this app has been screwing up. It keeps crashing and when I open the note again all of it's contents are deleted. This has now happened 3 times, but because I've invested so much money in the in app purchases (which are overpriced considering they're standard features in similar apps) I feel like I have to keep using it. Hopefully they fix everything and make it worth my money, but since nothing (besides the name) has changed in the two years I've been using it, I highly doubt it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Used with my z2 allowing to write with pencil. The app proved itself pretty useful in some conditions"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than S-Note, the speed and ease of use is unparalleled. IMO, old name was better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app but very difficult to backup or send to another device... Maybe like S-note have offline file"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus was a brilliant name. Instantly told me it was for writing! Squid is as silly as calling it tuna or mackerel!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use papyrus a lot - like I was just about to add something to my shopping list. Write in any colour. Erase with a finger. Great. PS Why on earth dispense with a brilliant name and replace it with a really, really silly one? Seriously?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When the app updated from papyrus to squid I received no notification. I thought the squid app was spyware and I unininstalled it immediately losing all my data. This is the second time I've lost all my data with this app, not sticking around for a third go around."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App still but still needs i think tobe Immersivemode  to cover the hole Screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"needs more updates though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very polished. I haven't tried another note taking app that looks this good and has all the features I need. PDF import in well worth the extra expense!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, fast, accurate, on the galaxy note, where the s-pen helps no doubt. The best handwritten note app I've tried. As for calamari... well..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only thing missing that I see in other hand writing apps is the ability to change the background color."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Vector graphics are the best. Simple and clean interface. Easily exportable to Google drive as a PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Squid just squirted their ink on all my notes lost everyone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I used this daily for about 2 yrs but it desperately needs Google Drive support and a more robust way to enter typed text.  The name change is ridiculous fluff when real features are needed.  The ""updates"" are shameful and show a complete disconnect from the user requests on their forum. It also lacks page editing and layers.  Save yourself some pain, some money,  and get lecture notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Didn't papyrus use to make Nascar games back in the 90 on pc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think Papyrus is a better name, but Squid makes sense too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's  gotten better since I first  bought it. Easy to use and saves to Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed to take notes on many different projects!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app, but if it had letter recognition like S note, I would give it five stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With my Samsung Note, note taking is much fun"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really responsive and easy to use note taking and also pdf editing - you have to import and export but when you do so it is much easier and more effective than something like EZPdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"عالی"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect with Galaxy Note devices"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think it would be easier if I can type in the  page number that I want."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Have used it for nursing school for over a year now.  Definitely the best hand written note taking app out there. Smooth, functional, and flawless writing with the S-pen. Beats S Note hands down. Love the pdf features as well... but customers have been requesting improvements for a while that aren't materializing.  Folders would be a great option for more personalized organization options as well as more widgets and customizable notebook covers. I paid for all premium features as well as many others so please give the customers what they want.  Last update was all flash and no substance."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ilove this app for galaxy note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've tried many apps for taking notes. This app suits most of my requirements. But it will be better if I can see the overview of all pdf pages. Because some files have about 100 pagese so it's difficult to find the specific page I want. Please develop this features and Papyrus will be the best app ever!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's NICE WAY TO TAKE NOTES !!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this App for everything! I import images of my agenda and then Just write it in! I LOVEThis APP !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect--and that's coming from a Post-It note lover!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"One note has way more features and is just the same for writing.  Stick with one note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Free version works great, but I was happy to pay for additional functions. Definitely worth the time to download and use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this taking study notes and works great. I've tried evernote but that's more of cloud storage for notes instead of actually taking notes. I tried one note because the desktop version is great but the android app is very minimalistic. The only thing i would like that's lacking is Google Drive support. Being able to convert written text would be good too but that's no small feat. Keep up the good work and i look forward to future updates"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Evernote, but the integration with Samsung's Note app and Evernote is really kludgy. Papyrus opens fast, perfect for jotting notes down and it has all the options I need for sharing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"loved it 😊😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far this one of the best Note Taking Apps. Better than any one of the available apps for notes on my Note Pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Coll"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have many note making apps...but this is the best! and the ultimate one..absolutely stunning...nice UI, exactly knows what the user needs...simply superb....have been waiting for this kind of app...since a long time..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use a Galaxy Note PRO 12.2 and this functions great with the sylus! Both the free and paid features are great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really intuitive. Great features. Quicker and not as buggy as S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it almost every day. Very handy to have. Easy to use. I have used it for years. Never have I had an issue with it working as it should. Great app! Thank-you to the team working on it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"How do I print my notes in this new version? Anybody?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Date time naming via system variables yyyy-mm-dd_hh.mm.ss is missing, otherwise great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Rind"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It cud have added multiple pages in one folder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"We use this every day in our company business"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing note taking app!!! The full version is worth every penny! Makes it very easy to organize multiple classes worth of notes. Notes are easily backed up to multiple cloud services such as Dropbox and the ability to import PDF is an amazing tool for a student! I would highly, highly recommend this app for students..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good app, frustrating having to press the stows at the top of the page all the time. A screen swipe, or end of page tap would be so much more convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it very much. Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its really nice for to do list,drawing, & taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The main feature I like is disabling the back button. It's really useful. But please do give us some colour options for the paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I've used Evernote and One note on my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. I don't like Evernote's paging or the way the writing looks. I like One note but it's palm detection sucks. They just need to add a simple cloud storage solution (automatic, not a 5 step process) and this will be the best note taking app on Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A must have! GS note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Sounds great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you are likr me and tired if wasting oaper and want an app to replace paper. Papyrus is that app. It works seamless with my galaxy note 8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Suits my simple needs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is kind of nice I can draw on it as well.  Thanks. Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Working smooth with attractive features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Snote is way better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ive used this for a few months now after heaps of research and trying out heaps of other apps. I have to say that this is the best note taking app and there is nothing else like papyrus. Great work papryus team, this is an amazing app unlike any other."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Takes pictures for board notes...for only $7 extra you can edit pdfs with color pens and highlight with shapes.  Dropbox is an added benefit for multiple computers.  Now this old guy can keep up with the youngins...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it because I can draw or write instead of typing. I can save all my works base on the job or customer name."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Your handwriting comes out too squiggly and janky looking, I couldn't get past that"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent support for Galaxy Note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If only it had password protection  for individual notes for your privacy this would be 5star app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For once I've bought a app that don't leave me feeling but hurt. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It is hard to write with"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I think this is the best note taking app I have used....however all my paid features are removed after upgrading to windows 10. Can I get them back?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best quick and easy note taking/sketch app for all devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does what it is supposed to well. I have not used it 100% but it looks promicing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is awsome! I use it all the time for school or just taking notes for other things. Just wish there was a button in the app to convert my handwriting directly to text like S-note for Samsung. This would let me write papers for class without a using a keyboard. I realize the main purpose of this application is for taking notes however, as an engineering student I am frequently drawing schematics with my notes and homework. Some template shapes and a ruler would be really neat."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I had some trouble with the app, but now with the new updates everything is running beautifully. I'm just waiting for a special zoom/writing tool so you can write without scrolling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a great app, but I mainly just use it for signing forms because there are no calligraphic effects for non S-pen users. It makes pen strokes look unnatural/computer made... Would there be any way to add simulated pen effects in a future release? Handwrite Pro has a great example of this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very interesting app. really cover all needs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need measuring tools, and quick triangle drawing...thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All this app needed was a theme update, but I knew they would eventually get to that. With this update the app is a 10/10. Thanks devs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice 1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Need to be able to go back into my handwritten  notes and move everything down if I need to add more notes. And add tags to notes sub folders etc. But still loooooove it!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ideal for galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taker I use it for handwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best way to use your Galaxy note 8. I love how I can grab and move portions of my drawing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It completely replaces paper notebooks without over complicating the solution.  Could not live without"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for Pdf annotations."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All other handwriting apps on the store are shitty.But this one looks beautiful and works like magic.Just magnificent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Drawing note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"can you please provide Google drive backup option  .: )."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls allow Spd file import. And transform selected handwritten with pen into letters... Is it possible to type in this?  Other than this good job on updates. Also is there backups for files?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a good app with useful features. Being able to sync with a pc would be excellent. The new material design makes it harder to use though, particularly with similarly titled notes. I wish I'd disabled automatic updates.  :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Work's great on my Nexus 6 and 9"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is the very best for taking notes,- the very best!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excelente!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Get this if you have a stylus. It's great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried many note taking apps in my galaxy note 4. Among the S Note, lecturenote, Evernote note taking feature and papyrus I choose papyrus. This is because it has no lag, infinite paper feature, cloud backup (purchased) and highlight features (purchased). Some areas that could be improved are : need toolbox to access easily (such as lecturenote), and the ability to choose which note to backup"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would love a handwriting to text feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With the latest design, i able to use the app more smoothly than previous."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with galaxy tab 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it daily for journal entries"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the fact I can use my finger to erase on my Note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"love the write with pen and erase with finger feature! best app for Samsung note out there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I know this app is mainly for note taking, but I use it for simple drawing also.  It would be great to have a few more tools for drawing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best PDF annotation app I have used so far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is almost perfect. I use it for my diary and poems and short stories, when I print my notes they turn out great and I love that it's my own handwriting. Please add the option for covers on the notebooks and please please add the option for passwords!! Once those are added it will be 5 stars hands down!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Is terrific . but would love to be able to lasso with Spen and drop directly into papyrus note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For those who prefer handwritten notes instead of typed, this is a great app to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best with an s pen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still NO SYNC feature though,  ONLY Cloud BACKUP... I have 3 Notes and I use Papyrus on all of them, I wish there is AUTOMATIC sync, for people with multiple devices, like those list apps (wunderlist) for example... a simple annotation will appear on the note file... viewable and editable on all devices, now that would set it appart. If ever you decide,  make sync optional for every notebook only and not the entire app. Next step is sharing and collaboration options... Wonder why you don't consider this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best tablet app available for stylus use. There barely anything comparable on any platform. It's smooth, reliable and well designed. Developer cares about this app, it's obvious."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love everything about this app. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a galaxy note 3 and I often take notes and mock up presentations and flew charts using the s-pen. I like this app much more than the Samsung S-note app. The grid background is wonderful, the zoom pan and erase controls are adjustable, which is nice. If you pay for premium, there's a nice automatic pdf cloud sync."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Аккуратно"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great new material design. Easily the best note-taking app out there. Is even better than the Samsung stock SNote :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Export to Dropbox is currently broken, very badly.  Unusable on that front.  Also needs an option to rotate the page when the device rotates, or even manually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No frills does the job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i love its new material design"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great note taking app, I prefer using this over the already installed samsung note taking app. I find it a easier to use, optimal to organize my notes, and a lot easier to edit my notes as well. *Update 4/3/2015* I've been using this app heavily for takeing notes, doing homework, and the occasional drawing for the past two years almost. I have a whole library of notes from nutrition to calculus. This App is simply AMAZING. It is the best app for the galaxy note 10.1 for note taking in my opinion. I wish I could rate higher, I cannont stress how great this app it. If you are a student such as myself, I HIGHLY recommend you download this app right now!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still applies, a fresh look is welcomed but doesn't improve on the service. No pen-Stroke smoothing(At least make in an extra, many would pay for it). Changing tools is a hazzle, the toolbar need an urgent redesign, not to look better, but to work better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this app. It allows me to have an S-note capability (even using the ""eraser"" on my stylus) and still be able to run AOSP or CM roms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Was hoping for long overdue multiple note export feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I loved this app until the latest update. I use it every day for my work. I updated it tonight and it has crashed every time. I'm using a Note 3 running 5.0. The new color scheme sucks. Why does it crash? I had given it a five star rating but with it crashing constantly I'm dropping it to two stars. Fix it and I'll give back the 5 star rating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I wish you could scroll between pages instead of clicking arrows. This is the only drawback. Everything else is very good, better than lecturenotes, and it imports PDF really fast too.  but this scrolling thing alone is a deal breaker."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very smooth writing, nice update"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for taking notes during Meetings I love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Had this installed on a previous device and now that it's on my new device all my purchased upgrades have been wiped even after uninstalling and reinstalling, would be 5 stars if this wasn't happening"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy to use. Nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's simple, quick and Accessible. While I do like S Note, I needed something that was easier to write longer notes in. This has been the best option for me. Update: After the update the app looks leagues better and is easier to use. You guys have done an astounding job. My hands go together for you and because of your hard work I'm totally going to get the premium packs. Thanks for the awesome app. P.s. I would consider making a developer page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung Galaxy Note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fits me perfect ly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The experience with this app and all the extras is awesome. PDF import is great. I guess it is really complicated because of the format, but it would be nice to  do all the editing directly on PDF format, with ""real time"" cloud-save, such as in some PDF editors. In this way the experience would be seamless and I wouldn't have to worry with redundant copies on PDF, old PDF and the backup. Also only being able to select a square shape is sometimes annoying."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app to write on pdf files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great, only a few features missing prevent from forgetting about S-note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"--- If you write with the page fitted to the screen (very small zoom) it does not detect as many points as other apps do (write, snote, inkredible...) leaving a very wobbly difficult to read text. If I want the strokes to be straight you need to zoom a lot in everything you write. +++ The best and quickest pdf import / export by far with any other app in the market. + Good sincronisation with dropbox - 2 clicks to change tools even ifi have plenty of space in my screen - Can't save predifined pens. -- You can't rotate your strokes. - It would be nice to be able to share an image with the app to add it to a note / current note. - The pressure of my spen also creates a wobbly behaviour in most of the starting and endings of my strokes. - The highlighter could be implemented in a way that doesn't paint over the black text (just paint the background) - A little bit more of personalization would be welcomed (maybe an advanced menu to keep it simple for newbies)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use as my primarily note taking app, reliable and fast. Thanks! The new material design is really good. Only one feature need to add, it is an ability to search text inside notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My search has come to an end love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I liked the app before for its s-pen integration and finger eraser, the new material design just added makes it now look fresh and modern. Excellent app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is excelent to work in office. Five stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Still rough and uneven lines and writing, which doesn't happen in Quick Memo or Evernote. Needs some finesse."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is excellent in writing and reading, it treats the pdf in a perfect way and is definitely worth the price. The only minor thing to be added is the possibility to scroll pages when editing PDFs. By the way, great piece of software!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good .... Awesome any one can download the app. It is great and work are so easily...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Though you have to pay to get the most out of this app, there isn't an app better in terms of ease of use and has the ability to write with the stylus while using your finger to delete is so much better than having to constantly switch between erase and write functions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"When I go to conventions I use this to take notes.  I truly appreciate it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easily to note and draw anything I need ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Bought the tool where you can edit pdf documents, after factory resetting my tablet I was not able to redeem my purchases so it feels like I just threw my money down the drain"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a phone with a stylus then throw away the notepad and pen. This is my app of choice for all those quickly scribbled notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a really sweet app but I will give them five star if they disable some how the back and home button and it doesn't work well when the screen is rotated..please fix those and have a 5 star rating"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"When you are rushing u might save a note incorrectly so take your time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Waiting for that material design update,such a teaser!."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I've spent months taking and saving important notes now, on the 3rd sheet of a new page I made, but then it just disappeared, GONE. I demand explaination."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I use the paid options as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So good for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 with S pen user take note, your SNote will not be able to import pdf file properly (my experience is that the pdf file imported to SNote will be pixelated). but until I came across with this app, then finally I can do my work like I used to. I can import my pdf files into papyrus and get my work done. Easy. Thanks papyrus!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app, it feels really natural and works perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly and is by far the best Note taking app.  My wish is they would have more management of documents like rotate and arrange pages in a certain order.  If that could happen, would be the perfect app, however I give it 5 stars as it is a note taking app, and for that I don't know how you can do better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"N / A"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's like my note book,anyway I dont use a paper anymore 😊😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good replacement for the Samsung S-Note"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful. I live the feature to convert to pdf and share using Bluetooth and email."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy and quick way to write a note or phone number down"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add google drive support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time for post codes shopping list and anything else I need to remember but don't  need to keep long term. Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add the ability to pin a note to the home screen. Users have been asking for this for years. This feature would allow Papyrus to be the perfect replacement app for S-Note/Action Memo. GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT! PLEASE!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've rooted my device and this app allow me to retain the stylus functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app daily with an S pen, and could not be happier with the performance"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is a must have for notes to self!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app because it makes note taking very easy.  I have separate note books and can add pages as needed.   I think this would be great for speech note cards.   Using it on a galaxy note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a lecturer and find it very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is why I purchased the Samsung Note 4. I am a visual learner. I work with children who cannot yet read or speak. Together we draw out our plan using this app. It is great to be on the same page with them, literally."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"To write notes, I feel this app is better than SNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just I very useful...for urgent notes time..even no need a pen...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Could use some material design love though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Keep it up to date so we can use it for all the upcoming years."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like many of the features of this app. Erasing with finger being my favorite."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program use it all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quality , style , simple ! ! ! ! 😊😉"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for. Handles pdfs well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give 5 stars if the pages render faster, each time I scroll the page takes a while until it display contents, also navigation inside endless pages needs improvements as I lost where I am and don't know where to scroll next"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"especially awesome on 12' tablets"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If this isn't as good as Xournal is probably due to these type of touchscreens. But on Android tablets I think that this is the best choice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"note 10. works great, it doesn't pick up my hand or wrist on the screen, just the stylus...almost like real paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliantly perfect for any school subject!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recommend this App to everyone, I essentially use it everyday.  Tried others but they just don't compare."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it to take note n drawing very nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A page count for multi-page notes and ability to jump between pages would be helpful for larger pdfs. Also, if the zoom lock could apply to all pages it would sa ve time. Otherwise a fantastic app for note taking, especially over pdfs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best tool for note taking, pdf import and export are great,  and good quality,  only thing I would suggest is in the next version swipe left and right to turn pages would be great...and also a lock button for each page, to stop accidently erasing or eraser select in one corner of screen. A export of whole notebook option would be good....Makes my Note 10.1 a powerful study and lecture note taking device !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need. PDF export is awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I have already bought the pdf editor option and it is now no longer open. It asks me if i want to purchase it again. Can some 1 help."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Each page does not slide with finger sliding movement. Please add this functionality to it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. As soon as I found it I migrated all my note taking from snotes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It does what it was intended for, nice work.  Taking notes, annotating files, and related.  Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, l have a 10.1 2014 and a Note Edge.  I use them for meetings and normal day to day things. If you have any note product and don't have this app, you are doing yourself a disservice. Buy all the add-ons, you will thank me later."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything in app is wonderful but it sill has room for improvement. When in reading mode one still has to press the next page button which becomes annoying  and does not really give the feel of a real book. Another improvement that can be done is to the widget development.  Overall I really love the app more than to the s - note.  I use this everyday to write my lecture notes.  Thank you :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, love being able to export drawings as PDF! Would be even better if you could set the object order (eg bring to front or send to back) and group or combine objects 😊"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does exactly what it says on the tin. Could do with cloud functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would like it to scroll down and give more paper as you write though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"06/03/15: Cloud Backup STILL broken. Backup to Dropbox and backup to Box don't work. No way to do a manual or local backup. Save your money and don't purchase the Cloud Backup option until they fix it. Uninstalling.   Changing my review because of cloud backups being broken and not fixed. Customers have been asking for Google Drive support for more than a year and it's still not implemented."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been taking notes for all my college courses for two years now! Its easy to use and I bought the PDF import for more awesomeness!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great replacement for paper. Closest thing to paper I could find. Very flexible and keeps all notes in one place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great overall. .. only 4 stars because no Google Drive integration (only Dropbox and Box)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pretty good alternative to S Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended for quick notes and mind maps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Just need to work on the back up function. It gives me an error when I try to back up or export my notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add shape tool to side button as it will be much more convenient when I do maths and physics when drawing diagram as well as fractional calculation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my daily handwriting app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really useful!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helped me a lot at my study For Msc and at work place"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app, extremely useful, daily driver.  Frustrated that it takes three separate purchases to unlock all the content.  A bit excessive, and expensive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I truly wanted to be able to take notes and this does it! Simple to use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved using this to take notes in class. I also bought the import PDF feature and it works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The free version is easy to use and I rely on paper for note taking less and less. The PDF add-on is hugely helpful and let's me import agendas and meeting materials and mark them up directly. Great program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the simple way it is set up and organized.  The only problem is that the page often resizes with my hand resting on it while writing.  Sometimes I can fix it other times they are lost.  Perhaps there are some instructions on how to do this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use to record whatever note, for quick access"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note taking and pdf signing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs to improve on deletion and editing notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This deal breaker is the lack of Google Drive support for backup. The worst part is that devs have not given us a clear, straight answer why they keep neglecting such an important feature.  I am sorry to give a very good app such a low score, but for me (and many others) this feature is absolutely necessary. Moreover, the fact that we do not have any explanation about the lack of this feature made me uninstall this app. **Update** The answer below shows that sometime in the future we will get Drive support, so I guess I'll have to wait. Other than that, Papyrus is the best of its kind."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for my collage studying and it's just perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for reading and marking up PDFs, taking notes and writing all manner of things. the extra tools and automatic syncing are beyond worth it. as an independent contractor who runs his own business, this is without a doubt one of my most frequently used applications. great work, papyrus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It requires Run At Startup permission. It has a sticky service that restarts itself even if I manually kill it. I am not using any of the cloud or other features that might need a constant background service. Why the hell is it running all the time? Android really needs to give users the ability to manage unwanted services. This is 2015, for god's sake."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastically useful app. I use it to annotate students work, to mark essays,  and to sketch ideas and maths. Works brilliantly with my Samsung note's pen. Worth buying a tablet for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the easy access and use as well as the advancements of using pdf's and dropbox integration.  Only thing missing is a followup date with a reminder for the note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think one of the best options for taking notes and drawings. Even the pressure sensitivity  can be adjusted . hope future updates have a share button"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a teacher who is doing basically everything digitally and this app is working perfectly. I haven't printed a single thing for the class and I will be able to take notes, do homework, and take quizzes all on my tablet. The PDF import feature is great and worth the cost!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for my school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app's ease and simplicity as a handwriting tool. I would like to see more pen styles, perhaps a fountain pen?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Magic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great for everything but it needs the ability to encrypt some of the files or folders"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Papyrus with my portable printer because I can output a note as a png file. This gives better print quality than Snote which is my favourite note taking app. But Papyrus comes a very close second and works well with the Spen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app if fantastic!!! It will make it incredible, If we can modify the text box. I mean, when you write text you cannot modify the box thus the text is static and you have insert new lines if you want to fix the text in the document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app!!! Please add a typing funtion so that you can type the page number instead of scrolling. It's easier to type a number than to scroll if you have hundreds of pages. Don't know if anyone has mentioned this already. Will up my rating if this can be fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After many tries with other apps I finally found one I can keep on home screen and in a second write down a phone number or name. The best part is being able to assign a name to my note quickly for easy reference later. My preferences are still set when it is opened - now waiting for it to work with Android Wear - any chance of that coming soon?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool, very responsive and functional. Use it for work all the time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Keren app nya.. bisa bikin note lebih hidup. Tks"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it in the dealer I work, taking stock numbers and basic Information on the lot without pen and paper, very convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like it better than the other note apps.  PDF support is good. Alpes printing  of page or book."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is just like writing in your Note book ! With many special function from basic writing(many colour available) putting image to your Note,  converting from PDF and save to PDF to save them in cloud so that you wouldn't need to worry about losing them ! As for the cloud function,  it doesn't work well with big file size of your Note, that is the reason for the one star off. Overall, it is a great app !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Would be better if can import images"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a note 8 and this program works great. It's just like having a paper notebook to me allowing me to write whatever I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best I have tried!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app of its kind IMO"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"1. Paid pdf import. But no page bookmarking.              2. Keep the current page navigation and add a continuous page flow or a swipe to change page and an optional two page view.                 3. Paid tools , but poor collection of tools, include shapes like arrows  etc ....and add a better free hand tool (check out inkredible) .       4. Add above feature and I'll add 1 star each. And I swear I'll be your promoter."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"After trying lots of apps that combine PDF annotation and handwriting, Papyrus is my choice. Unfortunately, in my opinion, there are three serious problems: 1) Lack of tool for text searching. 2) Page scrolling is horrible (new visible areas are not rendered while you scroll, it shows a default squared background instead - really frustating experience). 3) Page navigation is not easy when you have a large document (jumping from page 1 to 150 requires a lot of your finger)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really really like this app and do much better than what came on my Note 4.  Would c love to see the page just be continuous writing so would not have to go to bext b pages.   Just a thought."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Purchase didn't restore.  Buying it once more. Should restore after Uninstall. Otherwise great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beats all the samsung stock apps. Simple note taking as it should be. Love the finger-erasing feature, so easy and natural."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pdf annotating with this is next to flawless!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"With the powerful PDF - import add - on this is a very useful academic research tool. 5 stars when text recognition tools will be added!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic tool; although I wish I could move ""new notes"" into different ""Note books"""
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever seen"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Doesn't get better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't wait for new features,  so far it's perfect for me on the note 10.1 2014 Edition!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Using the app daily, very efficient albeit not the cheapest. Suggestions: increase hierarchy like OneNote  (notebook/section/note), auto-wrap-selection,  page preview/scroll in multi - pages notes. Otherwise great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"THIS IS A GREAT APP!! IT REALLY IS! However, I was just now writing on the note that held a whole semester's worth of science notes. I accidentally tapped the ""back"" button on my tablet and thought nothing of it; that happens all the time. When I clicked on the note again, it took a really long time to load, so I closed the app and opened it again (also something I've done before). WHEN I OPENED IT AGAIN, ALL 500+ LINES OF NOTES AND DIAGRAMS WERE *GONE*. COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED. What happened??"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app on market.... THE BEST"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish there was an option to change the page color."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is so useful and always works.  Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"3 things would make the tool perfect: autowrap for the text tool, re-edit for the text tool after insertion, adjustment of size for the true eraser tool when using finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Don't have any of the extra features but really enjoy using this to make mind maps using the infinite pageand quite easy to use, good range of colours and pen sizes. Also easy to export in various different forms"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perhaps the best buy i have made so far to improve the quanity and quality of academic reading i do (PhD student), notes i take and being completely mobile... Would highly recommend!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Could really do with swipe to turn page and maybe a way of finding pages in a large document. I make notes on film scripts which are around 100 pages. Difficult to navigate. I'd pay extra for this. Or have I missed something?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it, but would really like margins on the paper (red vertical, blue horizontal) i don't want to have to draw them myself. Any hope for this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"'Nuff said"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With a little help of software like ""note buddy"" you can replace papyros instead of default note software when you pick up the pen ( a galaxy note 3 user)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"S Note that comes with the Note phones,  i.e. my Note Edge,  has way more options. Plus out of the box does what this app does and more. Only one pen style and a hi-lighter. Big whoop. Oh yeah, you have to pay to get the hi-lighter. What a rip off."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Convenient"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good, I don't have any complaints."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app all the time. Makes life easier!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needed an app to allow customers to sign our worksheets while in the field."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"With erasing you don't have to actually touch the word and half of your sentence is gone. This is frustrating when you are pushed for time. Also you can't share your note through a text message..whats the point then"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung Note tablets & phone must have app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hahahaha"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app, works great with the galaxy note 10.1 tablet and the spen.   Though, for the backup locations, should add Google Drive as an option. I just bought the backup option, not expensive, but not worth it to me if the Google Drive is not an option. I gave it 4 start because of this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app! Please split tool button for fast switch between them and add handwriting recognition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, I use with a stylus on my note and love that I can zoom in and write small details then back out to the big picture."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this daily.  Have been using this app for over a year now and would not give it up for anything.  I used to carry around a 3x5 notebook and waste so much paper at work as scratch paper.  I use this now in place of both. The pro makes this app a complete tool for notes, drawing, or anything else you would normally put down on paper and keeps it organized all in one place This is a must get."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Edit: changed to five stars.            This app is everything I wish S Note was. It is simple to use and easy to navigate. The ability to write with the S Pen and erase with my finger is amazing! I also like the automatic palm rejection that is built in."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use evernote but still used to have notes on bits of paper.  Ive thrown away my lists.  This transforms my galaxy note. Functionality even better because of erase feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like papyrus app. I'm a writer. Like to make list. For example grocery list. I just pull out my phone and stylus and add an item to my list. Not constantly looking for paper that I wrote my list on. It's awesome. Great way to keep tract of family 's wish lists - can add pic of item to ""note"" so you don't forget the exact item they want or like. Write down store & price as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just would like to see a widget for easy access to the notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take all my notes for all my classes inns my phone now! Saving paper!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cool app works great easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"When looking at pdfs. You have to set each page or slide to fit your screen in landscape mode. It's utterly annoying when you have to do the same thing for 40 pages. FIX THIS CRAP"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app as advertised"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its a great app, I prefer it instead of S-Note, It would be great if it hat a better text tool with auto-wrap and a hand formula recognizer like the S-Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"5 stars if ability to access and update a note from multiple devices is incorporated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works wonderful for work on gal note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking/annotating. It is simple to use and works robustly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot overall, however, when writing, there seems to be a lag sometimes which makes the writing look sloppy. Any idea how to fix it?  Also as a suggestion: make page navigation easier by providing a side bar that show little previews of each slide (similar to PowerPoint). That way it'll be easier to find the page you're looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it daily for writing down notes while visiting with customers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good note taking and adding pics to the notes and writing over the pics :)) Will give 5 star if there's options if I can re-edit and move already added pics. Also, I'd like to see re-grouping of notes and moving into different books. I'll keep using it ..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nothing tops Papyrus for me! Keep bringing the features..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love ❤ it.   It would be  also nice if modified with ability to use keypad as well to type.  We can never be satisfied 😄😄😜"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great app, does everything you would expect from a natural note taking app and more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and get accustomed to I just wish it was easier to scroll while writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for anything with a stylus. All of the features add up to about $10 but worthit in my opinion. Especially witht the pdf import and cloud backup. Not to mention over $100 saved on notebooks as an engineering student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, but I'd really like Google Drive support and the ability to sort notes into ""Chapters"" or ""Sections"" within a notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been using it for a few years now,  and very happy with it. However,  a recent export to pdf was unable to be opened in Acrobat 8.3 (yes,  an older version) and while Adobe Reader XI opened it,  it said there was a ""fault in the page tree"""

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful..must have with note..!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like it. It has some nice features, but I've lost data twice. This app needs a ""save"" button. I don't want to export a note as a pdf every time I make changes. It won't let me save the pdf to internal storage or the sd card. It will only let me share the pdf to another app. I don't always have time to backup my notes to Dropbox. It should behave more like any office software. When I create a note it should ask me to give it a file name and choose a save location. I take a lot of notes.  It really sucks when I open a note and find that dozens of pages worth of notes have disappeared."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better if you could swipe for pdf files"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I find it very useful taking notes during lectures. Would be great to see a search function with in notes and an import option for Microsoft Office files such as word docs and ppt slides."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It NEEDS a palm rest function and then I would love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would give this a five star rating (like the app prompted to do),  but the in-app purchases are expensive (does anyone really use this workout the pdf import?) Also the app freezes when I'm writing which is very frustrating in classes where I need to get information down quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ótima integração com pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best of the note taking apps for handwriting I have found. Well featured with notebook support and customisation of pages, sizes and so on. Would be nice to be able to export directly to evernote as can be done for Box and Dropbox"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you want the feel of writing on actual paper, this is by far the closest it gets. Yeah you have to pay for additional functions, but basic as it is, it does deserve its rating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Which is unfortunate.  Easier import export pdf than snote. I liked snote way of turning pages and viewing all pages in a note set.  Alas, you can't  have it all"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app allows view AND add notes and add pages for further entries. So helpful!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using this app for varsity. It works really well and it makes taking notes very easy. The premium features like the extra tool bar and cloud services are kinda estential features for something like taking notes but they are a bit pricey. If they were included, would've given 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This is the first time I use this app to replace one app I used in IPad due to the weight and size of the device. How I wish I didn't as this app really lag during use. With normal writing speed I found the text I wrote simply not readable and the app seem to be unable to catch up with my speed. I have to really slow down my writing for it to work properly. I am using a Nexus 7 2nd generation with lollipop 5.02 and a Adonit pro stylus. Have to revert back to the iPad app till this issue is resolve."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very intuitive and easy to use and has most basic functions you need. It's a little pricey for the extra functions though. I really liked the delete function were you can use your finger to r.correct. Easy to print or save to Dropbox.  (Samsung Galaxy Note 4)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app for handwriting,  made me stop using the original s pen apps. I use papyrus to take notes then export them in pdf to Evernote, works like a charm. I would prefer old documents to be opened in read only view (with a button to click to switch to edit view) as sometimes I erase words by mistake while scrolling through the document with my finger (I have the erase with finger option on). An undo option would also be great. This is my everyday note taking app, on my galaxy note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy way to keep my notes for school organized. Would be better if I could open from other devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has been my ""go to"" note taking app for college this semester. I'm studying Electrical Engineering and keyboards can't replicate our work. So it's either paper or this app! Papyrus is extremely intuitive and doesn't distract you from the material, yet it has every required feature for great note taking. S note's inferface is horrible compared to how fluid papyrus is. It's worth paying for the features because they're doing an amazing job changing how people take notes. Welcome to the future."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This programme is very good the only issues i have encountered is that the programme uses a lot of ram and sometimes slows the device down. The other issue is that when writing with the galaxy note stylus , the writing can be untidy and unsmooth. Otherwise very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Calendar to use as a journal and export to SVG and would be near perfect.  Button to drop back to active area after accidently zooming out and panning to infinite never never land would also be good. A thumbnail zoom out view might  be nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful natural note-taking apps, better if able to back to cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only cons are the prices for in app purchases"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One suggestion would be to incorporate syncing. Have Note 4 and Note 10.1. Would be great to have them synced"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papurus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the buy only what you need purchase option. I use it everyday at home and at work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is better than S-Note, the writing is better, it has a real eraser, and you get the actual Pressure Samsung Advertizes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. Note taking is smooth and accurate and its a pleasure to be writing using papyrus. The idea of erasing with finger is amazing. Kudos to the Dev team for this great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good note taking app. But would like to have the option to toggle between revising notes or making them unreviseable. At presest all notes can be revised at will, resulting in some inadvertent deletions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great piece of work. There's still more room for improvement. Should be able to allow saving as pdf on the device than export."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for my needs, annotating PDF files and publications. I am mystified by having to pay for cloud storage privilege when I already have a compatible account. But I used a Samsung perks reward to pay for extra feature so no harm no foul. Still a great app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've upgraded my rating as papyrus seems more stable in later versions. Have not scratched the surface of the app yet, but for now it does what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could use a widget. Other than that best note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love this app. I switched from LectureNotes to Papyrus since Papyrus has a much better performance on my Nexus 7(2012). I just miss Google Drive support. Then I will have to give you the last star ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app gives Penultimate a run for its money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have  had a revolution in how I work and do courses now! I load workbooks on to my tablet instead of holding on to bulky piles of paper, and can add handwritten notes on the PDFs with ease. The only suggestions I could make for improvements is converting handwriting to text functionality, and scrolling through large documents with greater ease (i.e. being able to see multiple pages at a time to pick which one I want).  Otherwise, this is an awesome tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"We need an app which is able to recognise handwriting text then convert it into digital txt, instead of just doodling, which means making everything into just IMG/PDF(non-editable version of IMG). We need a really notes taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Gradually liking it more than the standard notepad app on my phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would love to see text boxes used so you can shape texts to the required shape easily instead of using manual 'enters'"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this for college courses. Have tried a lot of different programs and this is the best. Fast, accurate, and reliable. Plus you don't need to press save ever or be connected to the Internet to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Stupendous for Note 3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this to take note or solve practice problems without wasting paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"La aplicación de escritura perfecta para la Samsung galaxy note 10.1 el lápiz se desliza de maravilla el reconocimiento de presión es excepcional y puedes cambiar tamaños y fondos de hoja,  y fijar zoom para escribir como en un auténtico papel. Lo mejor es que puedes ir mas rápido con accesos directos como borrar con el dedo.  Muy muy recomendable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this alongside one note, and i've paid for the features i need.... did not pay for the cloud service, because i do not use drop box.... i do use google drive and one drive however.... *hint hint*"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Taking notes with this for my studies. It flows so nice. Smooth operation on a Note 10.1. Really enjoy using this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Great program except it reduces the notes I've taken into a blank page after I re-open the note. Fix this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a samsung spen tablet, this software is a must have (even if not it worth give a try). If you invest in the premium features (just a couple of pounds) the result is a user friendly, productivity enhancing app. Greatly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Highly recommend!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"In general I really like this app, but I just opened one of my notes and everything that I had written there disappeared! And there's no undo option :( how do I get it back?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome... Helps me stay organized"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great job dev. team! Thanks for listening for feedback."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Premium offerings with hefty price tags. 4.99 for pdf import, 2.99 for more tools that the one pen you get already, and another 2.99 for cloud saving. If you buy everything you're looking at 11 bucks for this little app. I'm glad I bought the Samsung Note 4 because I get all these premium features for free in S Note which has a lot more features already included. Papyrus is decent but a little too pricey and not as feature friendly as other free or cheaper handwriting apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is really useful and has some great features that I have put to use while note-taking and studying. However, there is an issue with the responsiveness of the touchscreen that occurs intermittently on my tablet, where it will stop recognizing my finger when I try to erase strokes. I have dealt with this by turning off and back on the display, which will fix the problem for a while. I have also noticed that the S Pen will occasionally write things about a centimeter away from the point where the pen is applied on-screen. I'm not sure if these problems are due to my tablet or the application, but other than that, this app is highly recommendable.   One suggestion for future development could be to include a feature where automatic syncing to the cloud is done only to files that have been updated/ written on since the last synchronization (instead of uploading all files to the cloud each time)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I bought the premium features so I could backup my notes to Dropbox, it hasn't worked for a while and now I need to factory reset my phone and stand to lose years worth of notes! They told me it was a problem with Dropbox, then why don't I have any trouble backing up literally everything else on my phone?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what it says. Nothing fancy, not cluttered and very easy to navigate. Revolutionary!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for work and at home all the time, works awesome with my Note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since I am loving this app I do recommend it to others. Since Nov. 11- 2014 I am really happy with this app. I look forward to the day when they also add audio recording and palm rejection in future updates. For those of you who want to know, this app works perfectly on Samsung Note 2 and Note Pro"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice! Can u add a widget where you can see the contents of a specific note. For example, if I make a note (a list) in my ""to do""  notebook, I'd like widget option that allows me to see the contents of that note on my home screen.... If this was offered this app would be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it but notebook cover and password option should be added..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Coming from the iOS world where drawing apps are easy and fluid, this comes the closest! My favorite so far.   Additions? Well I can think of some that would make this app stand FAR above the rest... to be able to create your own clip art library, partial delete of strokes, snap-to-grid or guides, adjustable curves, standard shapes, paint fill, object grouping. ;-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm an Engineer and use this app to markup drafters drawings, it works great for that purpose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app every day for studying and note taking, as well as for general daily lists."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"easy to use and is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to waste a lot of paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Have to pay for any useful features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't use my note without this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Despite reaching out to the papyrus team many times (with no response),  I am still having issues exporting pdfs.  Only small documents export successfully.  Large PDFs fail every time,  leaving hard work vulnerabnle to loss. I am dissapointed that in the year I have used Papyrus that there has been no resolution."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a good app but like so many handwriting apps for Android, it fails in the palm rejection department. The app needs to incorporate an option for a ""no-touch zone"" at the bottom of your screen so your palm won't mess up when you're writing. After that, I'll bump it up a star or two."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use, I use it for everything from shopping lists to work notes. I can glance at the notes in the app and read them without opening the full page. I also like using the one finger slide to erase mistakes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I now take all of my notes from class directly on my tablet. Combine with importing pdf files and adding images directly into the notes, I think this app is excellent. The add on features have great functionality. My only complaint is not being able to export to various cloud platforms (i.e. Google Drive)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would give it 5 stars if it had google apps and drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app especially for the galaxy note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app really needs a way to organize and store notebooks. Currently things get more and more messy over time. Other than that, its great for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. I use it when I'm on stock Touch Wiz or AOSP."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"love the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only thing, which I'd like to change - the tools panel. Too many click for changing a tool - click on the pencil, then click on another tool, then click on the ""paper"" - 3 clicks for just to switch for example between the pencil and the eraser... On tablets there's enough place to make all tools nearby each other and there's no need to show options every time (long click for the options would be better). Everything else is just perfect,  thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for my school. It's very good for notes and my homework assignments. The import and exporting of PDFs is the feature I use the most."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"please allow to add / remove Pages in an imported PDF"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for note-taking and annotating pdf's.  In my view, two features would really make it stand out: First, it is odd that, when reading pdfs, the zoom settings change each time you turn a page. If I want ""Fit width"" on page 18, the setting should stay there on page 19.  Second, using two fingers allows you to move around a page, which is great. It would be even better, if you could swipe to the next page too, rather than having to press a button to do that.  Other than that, the app is really excellent. Adding these features would make it perfect, in my view."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good and easy note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would have loved even more if the pinch zoom and palm rest detection was little better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Did all the in-app purchases. good for note taking and annotating pdfs . But lacking basic organizing features like folders and Sub-folders . Also it should be easier to switch between the pen and the highlighter , and between various colors • A tile to switch between these option would be really helpful . please look into it. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Samsung mega: always pop up toast about S pen and not allow to use finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Will I have a Samsung pen so it really helped with writing and coloring.  But yep the app helped me a lot on work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nothing Better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For instance, different backgrounds for the sheets, and maybe a paint bucket tool to fill areas. Still, quite a good application for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, functional, effective. What i was looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this to take notes on pdf slides using my Samsung Note 10.1 (2014).  Unlike S note, the pdf feature correctly imports all LaTeX math correctly (dropping minus signs and Greek letters at random is not acceptable!). I'm also very impressed with the handwriting -- it looks smooth and accurately reflects my paper-and-pencil handwriting. The Dropbox integration ensures I have access to all of my notes on every device. I tested several note-taking programs before choosing Papyrus and found I always missed the ""finger swipe to erase"" function.  I will happily pay for the pdf and Dropbox features when my free trial is over.  This app is excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just a small quirk, hopefully it should have material design soon. ither than that it's almost perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"provides an alternative to S-Note for those samsung owners who wants to try something different.  and now the PDF import function makes it more complete."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for Galaxy Note Pro 12.2...best note taking program out there by far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simple to use ..hassle free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Not everything is my favorite but for cloud an advance features after Evernote Microsoft one note is pretty good. I tried papyrus for review but u try it and decide. The bookshelf concept for storing your books is niceee on papyrus that's why 2 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I am facing though an issue when trying to buy the premium features. I am receiving the RPC-S-7: AEC-0 message. I am not having this problem with any other app only with this one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I Uninstalled the app and now every time I pull my s pen out the Google play screen pops up asking me to reinstall this stupid app. HELP please!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's awkward to draw on a phone but the basic feature set is very good.  Add-on tools are purchasable if you want to get more professional."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note-taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"THE Papyrus brand exceeds in every area for my specific needs. Whether in church, class or a meeting this tool captures and stores notes as described."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazingly useful and flexible app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Yup"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The perfect app for taking quick notes. Assuming you can read your own handwriting. =)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app very very easy to use... its so brilliently developed and organised that i did not waste time trying to learn how to use it. Lots of features too. I recomend it for every tablet user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"faster than others. great page / writing options/I love infinite Page, Need more work on classifying notes to tags1 classes ... etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Anyone who even thinks or suggests that this application is better than LectureNotes is 17 letters short of the English alphabet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app really is more useful then any other in it class and work great with s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's fine"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"CAN'T ADD TEXT W/O ADD-ON PURCHASES"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app for annotating pdfs. Love the variety of colors, customizable sizes. Feels very natural"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very fast resonse time. Like writing on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Also Love the PDF Editing feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love being able to actually write with the stylus and this app by far is the best I've used...Highly recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Yes you will be able to write notes but all the good features are locked up in the paid for version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried this app way back when I bought my first Note tablet. It was missing some of the features S-Note provided. I didn't uninstall it because I thought it had promise. After several releases, Papyrus proved me right. I use it for all my note taking now. The premium features are well worth it. Being able to import PDFs, mark them up, and save it to the cloud as a new PDF is invaluable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bamboo loop"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use with Note 3 every day…  would not be without it.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Works very smoothly and the organization tooIs are great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Also great for uploading math assignments where work needs to be shown. Being able to rearrange and adjust size and color of things has helped me create great notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best there is"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and I love it specially for the PDF editing, unlimted canvas, etc. But I wish it was more adjustable to have inverted color themes, with dark background and bright pen. I know this is not the traditional paper-ink concept, but it would be easier on eyes specially in the dark and easy to implement in digital devices, also saves battery life. I know no better option than this app currently, but please keep adding features to it to stay in the market, and please think further outside the traditional box. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This far exceeds my expectations for note-taking apparatus and I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it, seriously"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Need more widgets, no widgets showing the notes are there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time and it is fantastic how close to paper this is with the Samsung note.  I also use it to import my pdf books and it allows me to annotate with ease."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It fits my needs nicely."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"it's got every single necessary feature except a good handwriting quality. It's too rough.. writing any word that includes an ""i"" is a disaster for example. This is the only reason why I keep going back to other apps like Inkredible and SNote. Please make the handwriting smoother! That's the sole yet extremely fundamental problem"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app to be super handy and highly efficient for note taking specially if you use a stylus! It would be better if you could export your files and be able to share with other devices.  But it's awesome either way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add the ability to swipe through pages. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use it all the time. Never lose a note you jot down!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Could not love this app more. Amazing for students"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than any  other note app out there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good app, its just that the lines are jagged when I write and it just bothers me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes in class. Works best with s-pen. Not as useful when using your finger to write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Get the free verdion and if you like it at all, dont hesitate to get the full version! Very intuitive! EXCELLENT help from web page (click feedback). The web page is  also very intuitive. You can draw, type, input basic shapes and easily GROUP lines and shapes together as one unit (and ungroup) all on one page. One of only a few places where you can actually have a list of your lists! Slight learning curve, but with intuitive design of the app and a great help page you'll be using this like a pro in a day!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The page view widget is not present"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my primary way of notetaking in my engineering college. I love it, especially with the cloud service and expandable tool pack. Couple suggestions: (1) I wish the tool picker were permanently expandable so I could switch tools with one tap instead of two or three. This would be very helpful for quick notetaking in lecture settings. (2) I also wish two finger double taps were customizable so that, instead of zooming, it could toggle between the pen and the eraser or something along those lines. Customization is good, but not yet at 100%, even with premium features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app on the market, for sure. Couldn't live without it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the reason my stylus gets any use! Nearly a year after my first review and I still use it! As an artist I get ideas at all times and places. I use Papyrus to get the ideas off my mind and to a safe place for later :) instagram: fpunkfiona"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for photo and illustration markups for my art and design  Neater and cleaner than Evernote's (ever) green color, which bores my mind.  You have to try this for yourself.  Off to find a stlyus  :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better if support for exporting to Google drive and import pdf from sd card"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"So not obvious. You should be able to select a note and export without editing it first. I thought it became a premium feature but it didn't. I wasted lots of time trying to figure that out"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only changes I could make to this and other apps in general is add an ability to choose where it exports your notes when using dropbox. For me, it creates a situation where there's a folder within a folder within another folder and then I finally get my pdfs. The only time it let's u pick exactly where to export is if you export them individually, which is nice, but I'd love to have the ability to export an entire pack of pdfs to a certain location as well. Otherwise, the apps pretty much perfect. 5/5!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Its a bit hard to draw curves on two points touch screen.. Can you make a solution for this please..i really love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has enabled me to go completely paper free. I can keep notes during lectures, take pictures of slides and objects under discussion and draw on them as well !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Update: Just found out this app lets you transfer a note to a different folder! +1 star! Now it just needs to let you create sub folders. Then it would be awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been using Evernote forever but their free hand writing is very awkward.  I gave it up for Papyrus.  Such a smooth and easy to use app with integration to Box and Dropbox (with upgrade, which is well worth it, IMO).  Great app, will give it 5 stars when you can rotate images and selections."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nearly perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Incredible app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app I've found for handwriting, especially when it comes to proper palm rejection and PDF integration. (Galaxy Note 8.0)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"But desperately needs Google Drive connectivity"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking app I've used but the most recent update causes it to force close on startup. I'm using a Verizon Note 4."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my favorite handwriting app. However,  I bought some paid features times ago and after an update I lost these features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take notes on large pdf files several times a day. I have tried numerous  programs and this is by far the best! There is no restrictions on where you can write or how much. Very, very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this has enabled me do my 3rd year university 100 percent digitally...only time I wrote on paper was during exams and maybe typing assignments....perfect with galaxy tabs.....I suggest papyrus to launch their own brand of stylus pens....and I must say paid features worth it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great functions. I even purchased the PDF import function as I loved the function so much. However recently I have had notes not save properly which was extremely problematic as I lose lecture notes which is extremely inconvenient to say the least. I am currently using a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. If it were not for the save issue this app would be a 5/5 for sure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great as post-it notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app. Excellent for hand written documentation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"THE PDF Import Is well worth the ADDED upgrade price"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking.  Love this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and the best I have seen available.  Very effective at organizing all your notes.  The only limitation for the app is it's ability to sync notes between multiple devices. There is no easy way for this.  You must develop your own method."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am using this app more and more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only problem I have with this app is the cost to upgrade to pdf imports but the trial is nice and the writing with stylus is smooth overall. Great for students."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's better than s-note for useful note-taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a good note taking app on the Note Pro tablet. It would be 5 stars if you could resize text boxes. There are times when I'm taking notes and need to copy text into the note. The only way to get that text to fit a normal page is to make it so small its difficult to read."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The ONLY reason I still use this app is because there are times when I am studying where I need LectureNotes open but still need to write in a different notebook. So far, this is the only handwriting app that has multi window support (which is buggy as ****) and allows writing with the SPen and erase with a finger. SNote doesn't even support the second feature. If this app didn't crash every time I opened another app in multi window view, it would be a good app. If it saved my work before crashing, it would be at least a 3 star app. Emailed support months ago as requested.  Never heard back from them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is absolutely the best note taking app I have ever used. Worth every penny I paid for the pdf import pack, in fact I would have happily paid more. I use it almost every day at uni, and it has been a real game changer. I feel that this a brilliant app, and would whole heartedly recommend it to eveyone!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for handwriting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, straight forward. Pdf option definitely worth is, especially for school. Biggest benefits with the S pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has helped so much with me being able to communicate changes to PDF documents. Super highly recommend !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this program for document signing and writing on my tablet. Totally impressed, worth every penny for the upgrades!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is very good but I put 4 stars cuz I would love if I can turn the pages of pdf files like a real book not only from the arrows above ^^"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only app that I've paid for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a nice, straightforward handwriting and drawing app that makes a solid complement to any stylus-focused tablet use.  The developers have done a great job of sensibly balancing free vs. premium features that can be purchased in-app without making this customer feel exploited.  And so, I would love to give this app a 5-star review if it weren't for one *very* glaring oversight: the lack of any ability to share into the Papyrus app itself from other apps.  Come on, devs, this is Android and the Share intent is part of app making 101 for the platform.  Fix this and I'll happily raise my score."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best one for pdfs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its great for day to day note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the onyl thing i would change about it is that i would like the ability for the app to upload ppt."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Until all of my pages disappeared. TWICE! I lost months of notes! Rating 1 star until this deadly glitch is fixed! Nexus 10 running android 5.0.1."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Threw away all my note books. I use this to mark plans , take notes and practice writing chinese. Thankyou"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using on a Nvidia Shield for Calculus and Physics problems. Such an improvement to paper. Ease of erase/do over - plus infinite notes and organizing. It's a win every way you look at it! Only issue is active stylus detection for the DirectStylus but today's update is supposed to fix that. Edit: Now using d note 10.1 and it is the best, most natural experience imaginable"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can you please add custom page sizes? Or locking of scrolling/panning?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is an indispensable app for taking notes. I use it to jot down quick  notes or for note-taking in meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it with my note 2014"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The user interface is great with no superflous menu clicking to make notes and erase.  I love the jpeg bacground possibility but it wold be great if it was also possible to use pdf. The extra features are well worth the price. Papyrus is so much better than the software that comes included in Samsung Note 2014. Added later: now has pdf import, so even greater. Works very well with the S pen which alleviates risk for mistakenly writing  something by touching with your palm."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a mathematics undergraduate and I have no need for paper now! This is perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this to do field mark ups of engineering drawings.  It is amazingly easy and effect to use. The savings in time and paper is significant."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'm missing google drive sync!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best hand type note taking app i ever approach(better than Snote, Evernote). But still can improvement. And i hope it can support spen side button and enable quick tool switching panel."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. It is exactly  what I was searching for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Missing backup to Drive, external backup. Otherwise excellent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good note taking and basic drawing app. I relied heavily on S-Note but lost it when I went custom rom. Tried a few but this is head and shoulders above the rest. It handles all my pdf's with ease. Thank you devs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking application available!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app to take notes for classes and meetings for over a year now, and I love it.  I back up the notes to dropbox and can access them on my computer, which is great for both convenience and for the security of knowing if something heppens to my tablet I will still have my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great.....👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it takes too much time to change tools,colors, etc, a customizable toolbar would be neat and I really miss page deleting/inserting and such. I just tried the windows version, and there is some page manipulation, but the new page button should be shown all the time imo. With a great toolbar, where preset tools could be chosen with just a click, and some page and notebook manipulation this would be the greatest app ever. (I would pay very happily for these features) Still one of my favorite apps. also pen buttons doesnt work on stock samsung, which would just add the greatness of the app. thank you for writing the app, and looking forward to updates, so I can change it to 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app works flawlessly with my Samsung Galaxy Note. However, I don't use this app for taking notes in school because it lacks the ability to automatically save notes to a PDF file (you can manually import a PDF, edit it, then export it as a PDF, but you can't use it to just open a PDF and save your edits the PDF file). If you're looking for an app that lets you take notes directly on a PDF, then sync the annotated PDF with your computer, check out the free Adobe Reader app. I will update this review if they add that functionality in a future release."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think this could be a really great app if it had a zoom-handwriting feature.  The constant need manually scroll makes the app a bit time consuming to write anything remotely extensive. I do however enjoy the fact the inks thickness responds to the thickness of your stylus or finger.  That is a cool feature I have not seen on any other apps I've used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Loved this app for critiquing student papers, but initially gave it a poor review because the export via pdf function didn't work.  I notified the developer, and the new update has solved the problem.  I'm very pleased with the customer support!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for a quick note or even quick drawings. Trying to get the syncing working properly between my note 3 and note pro 12.2. .... probably just me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worthy of 5 stars since can finally load pdf and annotate properly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for basically everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app and a must for all stylus users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take notes easly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does everything I need it to do.  I was looking for an alternative to Notability from Apple and this is definitely the best I've tried (and I've tried a lot)!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works very well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for school, tried all of the existing apps and this is the best one by far. And the pdf extra is more than worth it especially for teachers that upload presentations prior to classes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think this a great app and I get my docs done fast. I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better then s note, using it with note 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Got back in the journaling habit thanks to the intuitive ease of use of this app. The main writing workflow has been nailed and that's what matters. Infinite page size enables you to write freely without having to toggle pages all the time. Keep up the quality work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I haven't tried premium features. Uninstalling because I don't think this program needs to run at start-up and it does not offer me an option to prevent that. Bye."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Having tried and been disappointed with the Samsung S-Note and Evernote apps, at last I have found a note taking app that meets my expectations."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love that I can make notes so I don't forget what I want to put in lesson plans"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"requires better sync. The Sync is poor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I cannot update this application help"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I installed this because I wanted something to import and edit PDFs. Paying an upwards of $12 for full functionality of this app is not worth it though ... Only one pen too? I recently figured out how to import PDFs on S note and is so much better than this, for free.. So if you don't have a Samsung I would recommend this, but he weary of the large price tag... Adobe app does it for free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has saved me so much time in not having to print documents to sign.  Thankyou"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. On low resolution screens it is a little hard to use. Would be cool if when you draw a box or a circle it would appear as a perfect box or circle."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Tqvm."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Thanks any way but I already have one like this!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"getting better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It's a great alternative to action note (by Samsung). It doesn't have the ""action"" features but it has a lot of other features that AND doesn't have. It is also without the few extra bucks for the extras."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than native samsung Note in many respects"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for my needs: taking & organizing work notes on my tablet. I wouldn't call it extremely user friendly: there are a few features that are over my head and aren't well explained. Overall: simple and gets it done."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for taking notes in class and it is absolutely the bomb!  You can select different types of paper like narrow ruled and even graph paper, (which I like to use for math class) plus more.  Organizing and accessing notes is effortless plus the cloud service is great for backing up all notes.  I highly recommend trying this app out and taking notes on a tablet in the classroom."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It does what it claims to do without being overly complicated. However, some lines on my PDF aren't being rendered in the PDFs I import. The strange thing is that the lines reappear after the PDF is exported. This was not a problem in the version available about a week ago, and I suspect that they will remedy this in the next version.  I wish there were a way to save the PDFs locally on the tablet directly and to encrypt them as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Anyone that gives this less than 5 stars is either uninformed or unreasonable. It's vector graphics - there are limitations which the app provides for. Sure there might be bugs but such is the nature of software. I have researched pen, handwriting, traditional tablet PCs, in grad school before touch screen devices were ubiquitous. This app addresses the limitations we had back then! It's downright amazing! Check out the folks at SBIM if you want to see how much difficult hard work went into this app. Props!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used this app to take all my notes last semester. It was simply brilliant."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It needs a night mode,  the white paper is hard on the eyes at night.  A way to change the color of the paper would be great, I would even pay extra for this feature. This is the only thing stopping me from removing S Note completely from my tablet. Please consider it, Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has quickly turned into the most used app on my note 10.1 tablet, the infinite space to scribble notes on has been great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like that it's basically an unlimited pad of paper that's exactly what I was looking for. Now if y'all can make it let me send notes by text message or something to that affect that would be awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Ok. It has some usable features like inserting a photo and cropping etc. This is very good compared to other apps.  But I would like to see more features: better paper styles like  rustic paper. Better drawing/sketching tools. These could be offered as paid options and am sure people will be interested.   Insert signature also would be nice.   Book shelf like bamboo note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I loved it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it when I need to write down or design anything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find this app best of many for note taking and jotting ideas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Este software me ha servido muy bien. Puedo leer y subrayar pdf hechos a partir de imágenes. El subrayado de este tipo de archivos no me lo permite el Adobe. Si me sigue funcionando bien lo compraré."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has a combo of features that are surprisingly difficult to find - highlight and take notes on the document, then save as the original document on my device so I don't have to go looking for it. What could be improved?  It needs an easier way to zoom the pages, like a default zoom level you can select for the document. Also, the default edit setting shouldn't be a writing tool. I should have to select when I want a screen press to write something. Default should be one-finger moves the page. It needs a quick page select feature at the bottom of the screen as well as a little indicator telling me I'm on page x of xx. Lastly, an intelligent highlight assist is needed - other apps sense the line of text and keep you on it, while Papyrus essentially has a draw function requiring impeccable accuracy to highlight."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, but PLEASE add support for google drive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Its a great app for note taking but is really suffering for the lack of a decent widget which can show one of your notes on the home screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app all day. In meetings, on phone calls, in the field. Really easy to organize all notes in notebooks for each object. My most favorite is the ability to import pdf files, write on them, prefect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Essential for handwriting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best in market"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Stock snote app has features galore but feels very laggy in comparison to papyrus. Not to mention this can pretty much do anything the average spen user may wish to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its a great app for notes memos and more. I like it. Just need a lock the file for permanent data and dont delete by a mistake data. Thanx"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"What kind of stylus can I use?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Truly natural note taking app....."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus works extremely well as a paper replacement. With the paid add on of cloud storage, I not only have PDF backups to drop box, but also (as a consequence) can access the notes on other devices. The one additional feature that would perfect this is character recognition / word search. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app has been great so far. I would suggest adding some simple features like going to a specific page number instead of flipping through the pages. Also moving notes into different folders is not possible at the moment. Otherwise, well done.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its good and much easier than the original s note app coming with Samsung nite 10.1. Add premium to back your notes on drop box or box. With premium added its perfect.  I really like new feature for importing pdfs. How ever it's good we can add note boxes on pdf. It helps to write and hide notes on the original one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Curves on letters are not smooth. Looks jagged. Unnatural."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for in a note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app for a while and it's the best handwriting app in the play store. In comparison to s-note for the Samsung Galaxy tabs and phones it's faster. Palm rejection works better as well. Thumbs up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful. All of the benefits of being able to take handwritten notes combined with the electronic features we know and love like filling, organising and undo."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app to take notes, I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take all my notes on this at school using my Galaxy Note Tab 8.0, and have been doing so for over a year. Thanks to the pen integration I've found it easier to use than a paper notebook and much easier to carry.  It's perfectly usable without the paid upgrades but they are convenient, and I wanted to support the developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good and to the point. Well done guys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really good. But pls add feature so that i can save file directly to my cloud, and ""go to page"" function is important. Then Papyrus will be perfect app for every note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Free version almost useless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's good for a quick scribble, or sketch, if you're not going to keep those notes. But, at the moment, for my needs it doesn't have the versatility or diversity you can see in the likes of Fiinote. However, it's going in the right direction."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have two note devices, the ability to edit the same notes on both would be perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's okay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Much better now that you can insert & delete pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for business meetings and school, works great. It has replaced my notebooks. I use it on my Note 10.1 2014 edition and Note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But i wish notes can be transferred to any type of notebooks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app, comes in very handy,  specially when a fast note has to be taken & pen & paper aren't available B-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs ''search'' button and I will make it 5 star"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only note taking app I use. Very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Didn't work on nexus7 2012? System is Android 4.4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only thing that tempted me to give this 4 stars is that it is not available for iPad. If I could sync the app from my personal galaxy to my work iPad, that would be fabulous. I fell in love with this app on my phone screen- galaxy 5s- but I can only imagine how great it be on a tablet. The base functions are great and work seamlessly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful,  nice UI."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is true American entrepeneurship.  Small biz taking on a big challenge and succeeding.  App could use some more features (e.g. rotating objects), but so far it is ""like buttah""!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Did not use the app today, but AVG Uninstall app reported last used status to be today. There was also 185k of data used. Very fishy. Uninstalling immediately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use this app on experia Z ultra to keep work diary"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have an old 7-inch tablet with an active digitizer that I've wanted to use for taking notes. Papyrus is perfect. Runs on the old hardware, supports pressure sensitivity, and has the features I need. Reminds me a lot of S-Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This has lost my trust. It keeps crashing and doesnt save my notes. I've recently stuff to whole pages. I have to export my notes everytime just to make sure i dont lose it for later. At times it stops detecting my fingers and only works with the pen. I have to restart my whole tablet for it to work properly again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Also the part where you can use 2 fingers to swipe up and create limitless page. Thanks all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use a note 2 n this app is off the hook. Way better than the S Note.  Thanks guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use Papyrus as an alternative for the Samsung Snote app.The only feature its missing is the Evernote sync.Would be 5 stars.Until then 4 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Evry time I lift my finger/pen, what I wrote/drawn jumps in random direction. Useless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best of all."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Previously in the free version you could draw shapes and erase with your fingers. They've put this behind a paywall now. Who knows what features they'll remove next  Edit. Thanks for the blatant lie. I had this installed for over a year with those features. To clarify, I used the granular ""true"" erase that didn't erase the entire line. Never installed an extra pack or paid a single cent. I have no issue paying for apps, i have issues with removal of features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ya it's a good software.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The is the best natural note taking spp I have found.  It is simple and effective.  It is as natural as pulling out a piece of paper.  I use this app for taking notes in my college classes.  Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Especially with a stylus that's fine enough."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is by far the easiest tool to make notes quickly. I would love to see a toolbar with the last 3 or 4 colours used and the 2 pens. There is enough screen estate for that on a tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works with a regular stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good work, thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I have a Samsung Note 2 that I was contemplating installing Cyanogenmod 11 (and eventually 12), and was looking at Papyrus as a S Note replacement. However, when testing it on TouchWiz it makes the Samsung keyboard invert colors and also seems to cause general instability of the phone when inputting anything via the keyboard or S pen. It may just be a problem running it on Samsung TouchWiz. I wouldn't advise using this if you're planning on staying on Touchwiz."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a very nice reminder"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is simple yet powerful. The infinite page size (which I'm still almost infinitely less than using completely) let's me not stop mid thought to add a page or move text over. The lasso (copy/paste) tool is scarily good at moving only what I want (gets entire shapes/letters without bordering shapes/letters or cutting in half), and for resizing. I'm assuming it uses vectors but whatever it is makes resizing selections stay just as clear and sharp. And unlike other apps it doesn't have any pause between drawing and seeing it on the screen. I used lecture notes before this and loved it except for the speed (even using all the tweaks the author suggested). And I didn't know infinite page size was a possibility. The only thing I can think of wanting is more shapes, like an arrow. But that's easy to just draw and copy/paste."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great for college students . Just like note ability, very easy  to  use ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it on my Note 3 and Note 10.1. Take notes in class while everyone else writing on paper...get it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good feel, feels like an actual pen due to the realistic text and freedom to move around the note book. The only app I have found that I like taking uni notes on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works smooth with tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for notes lists sketches etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it with my Samsung note pro and Note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Yeah its that goooood"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Loved it due to its name and then explored its features ..... Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good, but it really needs a dual view (zoom + normal size) for easier writing, and a customizable toolbar for quick color/pencil choices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Feels like real paper and pencil.  I no longer carry a notepad!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Astonishingly usefull!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program and easy to use, with stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not only are notes concise and just like on paper *I used Levenger systems primarily before*, I can do way more without bringing more writing utencils.  Pens *with complete erasing/undo*, highlighters, and boxes/circles/other ways to pull attention to specific areas on note.  I love being able to sign pdfs and email them without having to print/sign/scan, or add picture of signature manually.  All in all, the perfect compliment to the Samsung Note Tablets.  *Using 12.2 Pro myself after Note 3 was too small for real note taking*"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be perfect if space inbetween text was addible. This is a great option which I only found in windows journal yet. Furthermore auto open on s pen detach would be good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome applications. I can now carry my colored  notes in pocket.  Thanks dev's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a simple app to write lab notes or math equations . This is perfect for it and i can send it to the people through mail. Samsung galaxy tab4 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"why do they charge extra to use all the extra features ? they could simply charge a modest price of 9. 99 for everything and l will gladly pay for it all .Instead of breaking every extra Feature into Crazy prices ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Daily use app for school, would prefer if it could adjust offset like lecturenotes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than Evernote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"On the other hand the app is kind of cool, and fun, and probably good for data that's not actually critical.  This app lost me hundreds of dollars, and, except for my keenness of mind, could have ended in the death of myself. I used this app for mission-critical, real-time note-taking for medication and dosage management, since it was the only one with support for the stylus on the Note 3 and skeumorphic paper. The app glitched and deleted three days worth of notes (which are lists of numbers for me, including times and dosages), and replaced them with no warning with notes from three days ago. If I had trusted the app and not had the intuition that 'these numbers are wrong', harm could have resulted. LESSON: NEVER USE NON-CERTIFIED 'CONSUMER'-GRADE TRASH FOR MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS.  Negative ten, and the first review I have ever posted -- and ever intend to. I've never had an app that nearly let me die before. It's like a anaesthesia timer that counts two minutes per minute."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love marking up pdfs with this app. It's just difficult to navigate a several hundred page PDF when the book marks don't work.  I understand its an underlay. ...but that functionality would put my rating in the four or five range.  Still,  I use this all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for people who loves making notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than S note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love being able to take notes directly on my textbooks or annotate on documents my coworkers give me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pro:  Most intutive notetaking tool in the universe and also wonderful for annotating documents originating as PDF files (you can also re-export to them), especially since they make it possible to add additional pages now.  Wish-list:  Cropping, automatic page numbering, faster page turns, swipe or double-tap to turn pages (or custom tool), shape library (could make science/math/music applications better), word processor mode [yes, it would be revolutionairy to have a word processor that you can seemlessly have markups within]."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app and very feature rich for a free app. Wish it had a way to palm block with my cheap stylus and the margins like on regular notebook paper. Overall great app and I've recommended it to others."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 , and I really appreciate all the features, especially being able to write with my stylus and erase with my finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What got me hooked, was PDF importing.   After you import it, you can draw on it and take notes. All things saved automatically! Never any time you will lose your notes. ONCE, I lost a full day of very important meeting notes while using a different app, S Note.  NEVER AGAIN! !!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"برنامج سهل وسريع للاستخدام"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work well. Can't recognise my handwriting properly on scale suitable for my phone. I can't get it to make a note without the words being massive across the screen - trying to make notes on the lines is impossible, coz it just makes dots instead of the intended letters. Deleted!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of my favorite handwriting apps and I've tried quite a few. Worth every penny. I love being able to take handwritten notes and move them around the page if need be..inserting images..setting up college ruled template makes quick note taking easy.. Used with Wacom Bamboo Stylus, the eraser end actually works as an eraser!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,". . . When I got my new phone, all my notes were lost. What a disappointment!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The combination of Papyrus and the S-pen stylus on my Samsung Galaxy Note tablet make it easy to jot notes that I can save as PDF files for later reference. I'm not much of an artist, but do add the occasional doodle. Very cool that I can select text, doodle or w whatever and move them around, resize or recolor them and change the line width. Adding the PDF import function makes Papyrus an awesome to for editing documents. The thing I like most is the ability to draw mindmaps by hand and move components around. It beats the pants off any mindmapping asp or paper for this purpose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works well for me...but can you please add a inverted mod specially while using pdf with papyrus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need solid color Shape tool and various icons (arrows,..)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The hand writing is very jagged  and the in-app purchase makes you buy functions the other free apps gives you for free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app would be fantastic if it had some core features that I think are missing. Specifically, I'd like to be able to sort my notes into folders and subfolders. As best I can tell, you can currently only have one level of folders (called notebooks). I'd also like more tools that competitors have, such as drawing coordinate systems (x and y axes), custom pen presets, and free rotation of selections. But overall I love the aesthetic, especially infinite pages."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"perfect just great big help"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am used to Notability on the iPad and am trying to find an equivalent on my android. This app has a big issue that has frustrated me enough to delete it - as far as I can tell, I can't rotate what I have drawn (and resizing is clunky.). I'm used to pinch resizing and rotating for complex diagrams."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tired of typing ? Why not write ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Coool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recomended for Nexus 10 users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Goodaaaaaa"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"5 star If it can combine handwrite and type, also can attach other format (eg. Video)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be completely perfectif the jump to page feature allowed you to type in the page number instead of rrquiring you to scroll until you reach it. It can be quite cumbersome to jump 200 pages for example. Otherwise, I cant say enough good things about it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love uploading PDF's to highlight articles and add comments. I also use this function to upload Staff paper PDF's to take notes on in class (I'm a music major). Backing my notes up to Dropbox is great because it makes it easier to print and share. This app is Super easy to use. One thing I don't like is that when you use the textbox function it will run off the page so it's hard to use. Definitely worth purchasing all functions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works as advised. Saves as vector while most competitor tools convert to bitmap, so this tool has huge advantage generating PDFs from notes. Other great feature is variable (infinite) drawing area size. I am missing presets for line recently  used thickness (as it is already there for recently used colours)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Compared to snote  the only thing missing is OCR from the camera input."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The new version is very nice.. now you can add and delete pages.. but there is the same problem about the images that you import.. it loses the quality a lot.. :/ developer.. this is going to be one of thd best note apps ever.. please.. fix this thing on the images!! Hahaha............////////Very Nice.. the only thing that the developers have to pay attention is that when you import a image, it loses quality when you redimensionate it..  This is bad.. because when you export to pdf, the image have a very low quality and some other programs like Handwrite Pro doesn't have this problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best way to take notes,  as a senior college student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This it a very usefull app. I am using it to have documents signed. Though, there is one slight problem. And it could be my fault. When I am done editing a document and I hit ""save"", it does not save or save to a new document. Therefore, when I need that document for another client, I have to go in and erase all previous work. I can only hope that my uploaded document is not uploaded corrupted. I will take this up with the dev. Once settled,  I will change this. This is just so that others know."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for document editing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Fantastic"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent handwritting tools"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you want to take handwritten notes with a stylus, this is the closest to feeling like pen and paper. (VERY SATISFYING)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this for basic note taking! I have talked numerous people into downloading it, and they all love it for notes. However I am very reluctant to shell out over $10.00 for the extras. I really don't know why there are three separate updates. I'm no business major but it seems logical that if you made a ""pro"" version, bundled all the updates into one, and cut it down in price to say...$1.99-$3.99 you would get a LOT more purchases, and in the long run... $$$   Or at least have a trial to where we can try out the updates so we know if it's worth all that money. Thanks for the basic part of it. Please consider all the ones who are begging for more affordable updates. Do that and it's 5 stars all the way. You're close, you're so close....                                                          Update!   11/29/14 I love how this had a sale on the upgrades. I purchased a couple of them when they did. The only one I haven't is cloud storage because I don't need it. Also they added a trial period which is great! I use this app all the time and couldn't be without it. And it helps that they keep updating it with more features.  I would love to see the option for ""conversation boxes"""
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app .."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But not something that I don't have with other apps. +1 f for having a trial period for premium features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"They really nailed it. Most note taking apps with the pen feel glitch and I can't rest my hand on the screen, but this app allows all the comfort of a real pad of paper, with the convenience of the digital options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Now you can insert and delete pages as well, it's even better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this App has been a great addition for my tablet. It has greatly Increased my productivity and capabilities with my tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing I wish was if you could erase by pressing the spen side button on note 3, other than that it's the best out there!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The functionality to insert/delete a page between pages already created is finally here. Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Crashes every time I try to export all the sudden. Completely useless app now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best note taking app I've found. I like the back up to the cloud feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish that you could edit powerpoints withouy converting to pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ran across if you in construction this app is perfect for notes and making up prints in the palm of your hand!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app saved many ideas from trash."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I haven't use even a piece of paper to write down anything in the last two years because of this app. Good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the Note 4 improvements.  Thanks for all the improvements.  Papyrus is a great app.  I recommend it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing that let's this app down is the lack of control & appearance of the hand writing, the main competitor inkredible, produces fantastic handwriting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cm kid cm my kj by."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Well its a good concept exept one thing its always stuck on the eraser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wonderful,very good for taking notes while working, luv it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Big fan!!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Able to study and memorise with this notes really good for scribbling and even taking notes !!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Preferred over S Note, just feel the S pen is not the best on here. Feels just ever so slightly off.  Very minimal. Otherwise great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"gr8 but unable to import images"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Aweful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Once the back/return key is disabled, & after few minutes of use the app completely stops the finger touch functionality for the whole device. Had to restart my galaxy note every time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very helpful application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No need to bring a Paper note book anymore. Great app for Galaxy Notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Мерси!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one very sassy and efficient app. Add  a couple of options and this is unbelievable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is really great.i love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works fine with s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I tried about a dozen note taking apps before I settled on Papyrus. It's very smooth, decent UI, and since I use it for work, I like that it doesn't automatically upload notes to the cloud. However, for it to  be a 5-star app, I think it needs the following features: rearrange, delete, & insert pages; sub folders for notebooks; and export an entire notebook at once without having to export to the cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is such an amazing app for documents! I'm having a problem with my extra features, I purchased the license version of the App but still don't have my extra features? Please help fix it!  Please keep me updated!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this more than S-Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Used on note 2 and note 3, handwriting is not smooth. The stock snote app is much smoother."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"l still wind up using clunky Adobe Reader to annotate PDFs because it at least lets me sync my work in real time to Dropbox and Box. My purchase of the ""cloud services"" tool doesn't even let me specify where I want my files saved, much less work with my existing file structure in box. And the most often I can auto-sync is every 6 hours? I should have saved my money for a real PDF annotation app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is very good, only lacks a windows version of in general other os support. If so it will definitely 5 star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool apps... simple remarking..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice for meetings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than native Samsung tool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But please add more features like add background color to the shapes.  And the possibility to see all the tools in the same bar for large devices as tablets!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have yet to find out how to reorganise my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Paid for premium features but won't backup to cloud, the app crashes every time I try. Multiple crashes when taking notes in lectures. Support doesn't respond to emails. App needs updates to make it more user friendly ie  ability to insert a blank page, better highlighter, pen toolbar, ability to sort folders with subheadings, etc. Good start but needs work to make it great and I can't recommend it at all while the paid features do not work & there is no support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There is room for improvement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app I've found for note taking :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is really good  (although you will have to purchase some addins to really see its capabilities), and is my go to note taker. I have it on both my G3, and Note 10.1 -2014, and must say, it really enhances the pen feature on my Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But change the icon of the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"What's the point if you can only access the notes on the app. Needs a sharing option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Impressed. Just uninstalled evernote thanks to Papyrus! Amazing!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a nice app for taking notes.  It is especially good for marking up PDFs and taking hand written notes on them just like you would on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good for taking and organising notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great organizing tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best app for annotating PDF and taking notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick notes, reminders, phone numbers, - always using."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent companion for tablets with stylus, notes can be organized in folders and can be shared via .pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great for taking notes on pdfs!! I highly recommend getting this app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent service and I have to admit I was proven wrong."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's a money grubbing application that requires a purchase to do anything other than take notes. Like backing up to the cloud (only DB and Box) or even importing a PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Writing no longer smooth and doesnt detect my fingers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A great app for note taking. Beautiful pen-like writing with automatic resizing of ""paper"". Image adding is very useful, especially with the embedded crop and resize.  However, it would be perfect if the pictures could be moved or resized as well after pasting it. I find it difficult to have the pictures in the perfect spot with just one go. Otherwise this is one of the best note app I've used so far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this to take quick notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am finding this app to be amazing. It effectively does handwriting even better than Evernote with its pressure,detection. The only issue is that for the handwriting to be really neat, you have to zoom in. Fine by me though, I can easily write in columns"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Adding text and signatures to an emailed PDF, and then resending the document, all while on the road, makes this app a must have for conducting business away from the office. My phone,  tablet, and this software are all I need to keep on trucking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only thing missing: nested folders/notebooks.  Add that, and it's a five-star experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this App. Can do all note taking and pdf editing I need with it. Recommendation: add different types of pens/tools to draw lines, circles,etc...shapes/ make multi page  pdf readable as on doc with pages flowing top down..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app basically has every feature I need/want for taking notes in my lectures, but it has one severe drawback: the writing is NOT smooth if you are not zoomed in enough. There are so many features that I LOVE about this app. It is easy to take pictures of slides, crop them and insert them into my notes. It's really easy to erase, zoom in and out, scroll. You can import PDFs and write your notes on them directly. The app is robust and easy to use, but my writing has all these squiggly lines at the beginning and end of my letters and I'm really, really tired of it. Papyrus is the best note taking app for lectures, but these squiggly lines have had me searching for a replacement for months."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it all the time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for taking and organizing lecture notes.  Great response time and excellent layout."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, with my note 2 I use it for everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Where have you been all this time.... love this app already even after a very short time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Fit screen sometimes not work. The paper will be covered by the upper bar. When my screen gets black and i press my home button to wake it up it will quit and take me to my home screen. Same when my screen dim, when I touch the screen to light it up it will write on the screen instead of light it up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm super duper cereal"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Love the app.  However constantly getting checkerboard when scrolling.  This can get SUPER ANNOYING when teaching!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Feels very close to paper.  I wish that I could add pages in between pages that I've already used."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am a general contractor and I use Papyrus to keep all my daily log notes, meeting minutes, markup PDF's, and sketch up fixes in the feild.  I particularly like the ability to import pictures or clips of the contract documents which I mark up and send to subcontractors.  It improves my productivity as well as keeps me organized.    Like many of the other reviews, the only con I see is that you can't insert pages into PDF files.  My work-around on this is that I leave a little extra room on my meeting minutes so I can jot down notes during the meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works beautifully on the Galaxy Note 2014. I now take all my notes with this app, pdf them and send them into Evernote. The only improvement it needs is the ability to delete pages. Otherwise a great, simple note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's easy & simple to use. Great application!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's OK only"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Papyrus is a way better app than the standard Snote app for Samsung Galaxy Note 1, 2 and 10.1 and NotePro 12.2! Better pen and pressure detection and possibility to turn off 2 finger zoom (to prevent accidental zoom when resting your palm on your tablet/phone).  Only thing I'm missing is custom notebook structure, like a notebook within a notebook. (standard directory structure).  5 Stars when it has!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's very smoothy when using a pan to write or draw. Design is nice, icon of this app is very beautiful! Very Happy to add the icon to home screen. The impressive things are select tool and eraser. Draw a circle and it can select all kind of things you want. then you can move it or delete it! Works like magic. Actually, it works better than a real notebook. ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need to add the possibility of adding blank pages in imported pdfs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"app is ok, only one i can write in but when i lay my hand on the screen to write it changes the sheet size or moves the page orientation around, wish I could add lines or spaces within a note i had previously made.  also move notes to diff headers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool application.  I have used for 2 years now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ive tried them all but this map is perfect for my note 3. It should be included as a default application!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bulk installed around 10 similar apps looking for something like this. Nothing offers such a well design app for note taking. This is the only one left installed. Operation is learnt in about 5 mins.  No nonsense design means you can open new or add to existing organised notes or notebooks with very few selections.  I'm using it in the context of an IT support department so I need to get going in the time it takes to pick the phone up and say 'hello'.  Writing tools are easily changable as you go with 'extras' little more than the cost of a similar paper notepad. Editing facilities are excellent with erasing / box drag select sections.  When done notes can be sent to the cloud in a couple of taps to access from anywhere to whoever selected."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Previously gave this app a bad review, after the crashing problem on the lenovo thinkpad. The problem occurred after the trial of some features expired and I thought they were linked. I have always liked the app, an updated review would do justice to the app. Its a great app. Thanks to the developers for their great work and thanks for fixing the crashing problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best creative doodle and draw pad perfect for my every day sketches and art."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Papyrus is a great app (I even bought the extra tools) but the writing process on it is terrible slow once you have to keep sliding the page when the empty space in screen is gone. Some other apps (like INKredible) have a text box set in the lower part of the screen where you write in a higher zoom and it updates the real ""sheet"" in normal scale. That would REALLY speed up the writing in the app and reach even more users, that like me, expects to completely leave the real ink and paper behind. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for college!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the writer and the fact that I can delete with my fingers. Print it and  / or  save it. I use this all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best handwriting app I've tried.  Would love to see an auto synch w Ever note and a few other features but think they'll et there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fine"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, I am enjoying usong it, especially its auto save."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is by far the best handwriting app available. Cloud Save is a critical feature that is only half baked into Papyrus. If I save a note in the cloud on my Galaxy Note tablet I expect to download it on my galaxy note phone and continue editing. I would love to see the cloud functionality work similar to Evernote."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I would really like a functional widget to be implemented. Like a post-it. I use this app with my S-Pen from my Galaxy Note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"cool concept but not free, why do i need to pay for a pdf import, back up, and text?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great that Too can fit so much On one page. Writing is fine even at max Zoom. Would be nice to have a graph template. looking forward to any futore updates and in provements"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice, simple, and dynamic!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App. There is another feature I like to request, a note widget which shows notes on home screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why can't I write anything?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use the app to draw logic diagrams that I need to turn in. Works great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Cut and paste is very useful. Would be better if when exporting to pdf text is not converted to image"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Check lecture notes its much better trust me especially when u modify it as u like u will love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Writing is not smooth. There really needs to be an option, possibly a separate pen that smooths the writing. Writing in this application looks jagged and rough."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love Notability on the iPad. This is the closest app I have found to it. It needs a few more things to measure up but it is a very good app. Probably the best Android note taking and pdf annotating app I have found."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried this in trial vs three other popular apps and this was simpler to use and it rendered faster than the rest, too. Would recommend. Trial period for add-ons are super convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really like this app. Features like split screen and the optional drawing upgrades make it a joy to use. Highlighter can act more like a water color or marker- all in vector!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it every day for notes in all of my classes as a physics major. The type and tools add on is excellent for diagrams (even ray diagrams for optics). Also, I had a problem with an update and the tech team updated within a week and saved my semesters notes. Great app with a great team behind it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have the note 3 and this app is excellent for taking notes. It replaces pen and paper for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Although the developers promised since 2012 to add page management on notebooks, still there is no option to move or delete pages from notebooks. This could be the best note taking app, but the developers apparently abandoned any further improvement. And the export function that is a paid option does export .pdf files everywhere BUT locally!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add handwriting recognition to convert handwritten notes to text and this app will rule the world."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best one for me yet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, notes are clear, organizing is simple"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Photos lose accuracy when resized but Otherwise it is good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app on my phone as it supports multi window. Bought all the upgrades and use it daily. Unfortunately on my note pro 12.2 it doesn't support multi window. Can you please fix this? Then it's definitely a 5 star app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great writing App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it for doing math problems and just love how easy it is to use. I like how I can create different notebooks for different subjects having all my notes in a neat and organized manner. Last thing is I like how they quickly fix the tegra 2 crash on startup issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely perfect. It's quick and easy. I needed an app that allowed a never ending pagw, which this does."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a math graduate student and I use Papyrus to take notes in class and to prepare my own lectures.  I find the export option great for posting hand-written solutions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Not many options for free version users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the automatic backup feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wish it had added features such as reminders or a method to add to a calender.  Maybe there is already a way but I don't want to use multiple apps for the process..  It would defeat the purpose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it. Really helps me to get my job done. Simple and handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app almost every day for my work as I can take notes with images and email them to my colleagues as PDF's. My only complaints so far are that Papyrus needs to integrate with imaging apps better. Also, more flexibility as to images in the notes (i.e. once the the image is placed in the note you have no alternative but to ""undo"".). Otherwise it's a great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"After an update was automatically installed on 10/16/14, I can no longer open this app and it appears that I am not the only one with this problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It makes note taking so easy and clean"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Well, I installed this today with high hopes that I had found a nice app to replace SNote. It installed fine, but I can't write. All that happens is this little blue dotted box that doesn't do anything. I am very disappointed about this. I've seen lots of people complaining about this last update, is this a consequence of it?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Since the latest update, the app won't even open anymore. Not sure what's going on..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app, its great for school but it crashed with the new update. I cant open the app and im sure i lost all of my notes since i cant even open it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Find it better than s-note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love being able to drag and drop notes into folder. Also think $3 to sync to Dropbox or Box is worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very east to take quick notes and notes needed for school work. Very easy to retrieve for review as well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for taking notes in lectures"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would really like if I could add a page in between pages, right now i can only add pagesa the end. Other than that i absolutely love this app, i use it more than the actual Snote!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would like to easily type though"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is the perfect note taking app. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that the app doesn't sync with my pc. Only my tablet and phone. Otherwise it is the best note taking app, hands down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am teacher and use it with my tablet connected to the projector and it is awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. I use it constantly (note 3 user, here). But I'd love to see some improvements to the allowed organization options. Ex: Move existing note from ""unfiled"" to some user-made notebook, and insert/remove whole pages within a note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"This app was great until the last update. Now it won't open even after a factory reset on the tablet. Extremely disappointed since I have paid features in this app. Please fix issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i love it!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app. I began using S Note to take all my notes in class (using Galaxy Note 10.1 2014) and it work fairly well. However, it lacks some basic functions I needed. For example, syncing with my Note 2 and unlimited page sizes. This app brought that to the table."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"На сегодняшний момент самый лучший инструмент для рукописного ввода! Рекомендую! Использую на Asus Transformer Infinity T700"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Prefer it over S Note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Not used to writing with my finger on such a small screen. Would be better if offered a keyboard option also. Finger writing is sloppy and I tend to use to much space handwriting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i like this, others were extravagantly developed to dismay the user. keep it up"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take notes for class and it's amazing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Lovely note-taking functionality, would be absolutely perfect if only it had an automatic Evernote sync instead of manual export"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was a user of papyrus but i unstaled by mistake. Now i tried to install the app again but it doesn't open....what should i do?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exceedingly helpful taking quick notes while on the go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best application for reviewing and annotating academic journal articles"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for the note 3. Works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Deleted all my notes while I was in the middle of writing for a stupid update that I didn't approve and blocked automatic updates. Worst app ever. It makes youpay for every little thing too. Notability is better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app won't open for me any longer, meaning I just lost all my notes for the semester."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it full time in college for note taking. I purchased the PDF enhancement, use another app to convert power points to PDF and now can take notes directly on full page power point presententation!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent....5☆"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The free version is good, this app meets my needs perfectly, like a real notebook. This is the perfect app to get the best from the s-pen. I have been using this app ever since I got my first Note and it just gets better and better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The endless page feature is great. My phone doesn't come with a stylus though, so to make the most of finer drawings, I have to carry one. A finger is too coarse for some tasks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Real productivity enhancement to my Note 3. Strikes a good balance between functionality and creativity. Being able to write and sketch with vectors means you can zoom in pretty much infinitely. Keeping up with updates. Still like to see UI improvements. But this is the best app I have found so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such an improvement to paper, milk easier & faster. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Dont like always looking at my own handwriting. But its a good app for any writing letters or school notes. Wish letters didnt have jagged looking edges and would sharpen to look better when writing from less than 70% zoom."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its the smoothest note taking app on the note 10.1."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does what it says, very helpful now that I can't remember anything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great alt to my s note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After looking at just about every noteapp out there, this one has proven to be the best. Easy to use allows you to import Pdfs and allows you to quickly adapt the Page style to your needs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best best software for reading and notes.. but no option for bookmarks.. Please add bookmark option. Have to use others because of this issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even using my fingertip on an S4 the app is fairly accurate in terms of handwriting. Can't wait to try it with an S pen on a Note 4."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great software, works great with the S Pen which I've been looking for in a note taking app. Add ons are also great. Like many others, handwriting recognition would be even better and a good addition in future. Keep up the great work, great value for money!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is truly a note book in your phone, I use it with my note 2 and the results are amazing, whether you want to take a quick note or you want to keep track of your classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No more scraps of paper with reminders on them! Everything is right on my phone!  Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Over 2 years ago they emailed me, ""We currently have night mode on our list of future features. Please stay tuned!"" The Galaxy Note uses AMOLED; using a white background forces each pixel to emit light."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use papyrus for my college class notes and can back them up to the cloud no problem. Does what it says and more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's the shi7"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quick and responsive. switching between pens and marker is a bit of a drag. Can you erace using finger is a nice touch"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple,yet effective package for note-taking.  I love importing pdf documents and  writing on them.. The tool bars let you do many activities quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was expecting more from last update. For example I would appreciate preset pen toolbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than the default Samsung note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for notes. For writing and drawing. Serves great for students and also professionals."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best 'notes' app I've encountered.  In fact, 'notes' is a very limiting description - as I've certainly used it for grocery lists - but for more complex planning work, idea and even rough sketch sharing with clients, and more.  This is the sort of app that phone and tablet makers should ship natively, but don't.  Thank heavens for Papyrus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This glaring shortcoming in the app stops me from using it even after buying paid features. I see numerous request for this feature on the app's website, but the developer does not respond or even acknowledge on this request."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Downloaded materials too, are easier to read with Papyrus. I can easily write extra note for my my own reference on the blank spaces available in that PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Yeah....entering text on a keyboard via a dialog box is HORRIBLE ui design, could be a great app, but for this one feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent for taking lecture notes in university, particularly with the import pdf function. Only one complaint: I wish it had a better handwriting to text function, as the current one is ungainly and impractical for taking notes quickly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to export to one drive love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried several note taking apps and this is by far the best. I can easily open my pdf files and mark up in real time during meetings. Once complete I simply export to Google Drive for safe Keeping. My two complaints are the lack of cloud support for Google Drive and the inability to sync across multiple devices. I've overcome these by using the export feature but full integration would move it to 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Tried several note taking apps and love this the most. Will be better if it allows some form of pen to screen offset adjustment."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"VERY frustrated, the app is freezing in the middle of taking notes. I contacted support but apparently I'm not worth the time to investigate my issues because I have not received a reply. Looking to replace this app with another PDF viewer/editor unless I hear something shortly.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A simple and easy amd strait forward."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why can't it be open the program and start writing...why not mention not suitable for TABLETS..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Especially if you're using a Galaxy Note device. Well done. Updates continue to improve an already wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works nice with galaxy note 3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Reminds me of the ideal ios app ""good note"" if teachers ever allowed thus in the classroom environment it would evoultionize notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is simple, effective and it's free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is brilliant as far as the writing goes. l particularly appreciated the possibility to ""turn off"" the return button on my Samsung Galaxy Note, so that accidentally touching it does not disrupt the work flow. l only wish there were a convenient way to synchronize notes among different devices. l was unable to find one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The writing  quality  is great  but many features are missing.  Take a look at metamoji and add their features specially for pdf annotation. Why can't we use side button of spen? I don't get your explanation on your website, there are many apps using the side button. When there is no side button for switching between pen to highlighter 2-3 stroke which is very painful while reading technical stuff. Please think about a solution! Maybe you can let us switch between pen/eraser/highlighter by side button (without holding it down) just like s note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app for note taking in classes and it works well. I recently started a trial of some of the premium features, but the cloud services won't work. In fact, I can't find any settings for this app. The website is vague with its help and I'm stuck with not being able to fully try out the premium features. It makes me want to not buy it if it doesn't even show up, or if I can't find the way too turn it on. I can't change the paper types to not have lines on it either..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take notes all day long and this is the best way to do that.  I have tried all the other apps that can do this, but this is the one that is the best bar far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Making my life easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy and fun to use! Highly recommend it to galaxy note pro users!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No learning curve. Just start using it. Handwritten notes. Take a picture and mark it up. Mark up pdfs. Make the sheet infinitely large so you're mind map can go on forever. This is the app that makes my tablet useful. Months later: The more I use this the better it is"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using for a few weeks now and by allowing me to import files, lecture notes and images as well and write on them really enhances my learning. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this everyday for engineering classes. The precision is great zoomed in but far out it can get sloppy and hard to read. Even with a precision stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app...simple, user friendly and useful...sensitive with my stylus pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love how the digital inking capability works well, it would also be nice if it can also support typing. Something like a word processor."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Seems like a handy tool once mastered. Am I missing something, or does it not sync between devices?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Was down to 2 stars (from 4) for not letting me restore previous purchases after device reset - but that bug was fixed so it's up to 5 stars. Had upped it to four stars becuse had much improved ----- but for the fifth star, I needed a way to re-file notes that I accidentally created in the wrong notebook --- but they fixed that too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Need auto smooth line when draw anything , Tranform anyline to shape function"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with my SPen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday for taking notes and annotating pdfs. I love how it's a one flat fee instead of a yearly subscription like other apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I especially like that it date and time stamps everything automatically."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Far better than the stock note 3 one and far more usability. Great for shopping lists"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for quick note taking throughout the day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the only android app which allow you to pan on unlimited page area, it only misses: -Some background styles, -Better clssification pannel like that of MS onenote 2014,  -Ability to embed sund note or multimedia files.  Yet, I didnot chick for PDF & clouding functionalities"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best App ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes and handrawing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I liked all of the options for notes, especially color coding.  You should know two things, the pressure pen which makes it look so good isn`t availanle on most devices and you must pay for things like the typing feature. Have a decent stylus when writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for solving math problems and taking notes. The import/export of PDFs is extremely useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use everyday to take notes for work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As a student, I find myself in need to draw quick graphs and basic shapes. Used to love the old snote where it used to convert your wrinkly looking box into a more refined form, and smooth out your roughness while in shapes mode. Would love to get a similar feature. Where I can turn on shape mode and it would make the lines look neater and smoother. Best note taking app out there, tried many. Recommend this 👍"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful and Fun ... Take notes or doodle... Even saves an empty note which is a little annoying... Otherwise awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would give 5 stars if it would sync with evernote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A little expensive for the extra goodies but really good writing interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So fanrastic handwritting tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend. Work great for marking up documents and export/share then right to Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A very nice and simple free flowing app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not smart like the others"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app will really make your stylus shine.  Perfect for notes, blueprints and doodles, the app will not detect your palm while using your stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be awesome if importing of multiple pdfs was possible instead of being limited to one pdf at a time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Putting this on all my android gadgets!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"For writing on PDFs with an S-Pen or even text boxes, this is by far the best app.  I tried Adobe Reader, LectureNotes, PDF Max, and EZPDF and none of them gave me the clean and intuitive interface. Few gripes: S-Pen side button note working. Both Lecture Notes and INKreadible support the s-pen button (can't the Devs do something atleast for rooted GMD users?) No easy way to preview pages in a large document. One-finger eraser size cannot be set. Bluetooth keyboard should override pen-only setting. (i. e you should be able to click somewhere with the mouse and input text even if ignoring finger input) ....all and all, worth hefty price of the premium features........still no s pen button support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be great if the app could have search function, to search between the many notes I already have instead of having to go through each of the notes there are.  Tagging options would be Soo Cool. Aside from that, this is the best app for this purpose : fast, sensitive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far so good with the app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The strock is laggy and writing is not smooth the curve line hav a sharp angle like polygon, I use on Galaxy Note 3!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using it for the past 15 months and its one of the best in the market..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Edit: the workaround fixed the problem. 5 stars app. Since the last 3 updates(if I'm not mistaken) the stylus stopped working as an active stylus. If I select active stylus it detects stylus input as finger input. Occasionally it ask me to select active stylus and it works for a while. Please fix this and I'll give 5 star rating."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using with Note 10.1 2012 edition and works great with the s-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very good app but still missing sync function. My tablet and phone can't have same notes :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this with a galaxy note 2 makes it seem like you're writing on paper it's so quick and responsive. By far the best handwriting app for the s-pen. I frequently mark up large PDF files and it is so smooth and easy to use. Well worth the money. I wish it allowed you to open files and communicate smoothly with Evernote since it's much better than the skitch app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Writing is very choppy and illegible. Needs improvement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the pdf import ability and drawing on top."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Work perfect for me. But it would be cool, if you can sort pages inside book (change their order, copy/cut them to another book, etc)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful  for college student. Very organized."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app to take notes in all of my classes. It's great but I wish there was the ability to delete or move pages within a note!! Once you add a new page you can't delete it. I would also like to see the ability to import PowerPoint files in addition to importing PDF files! That would be so tremendously helpful for students!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is even better than s-note just what I need"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does everything it is supposed to do and more, and easy to use. Improvement would be to support line smoothing for small stylus such as the Nota."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Love the note taking capability and s pen integration but without cloud sync I'll look elsewhere.  If they add that and the ability to delete a page and reorder pages, I'm their customer for life."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not too fancy like s note but really gets the job done. Clean and smooth. No lag.  Simple backup and restore system. Writes faster than s note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I switched from ipad to the note pro and this app is so much better than any other app an i pad could offer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a very usefull app, it's missing a few features like the ability to delete or reorganize pages inside the notes, but otherwise is great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simbly ebin"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it every day"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"(1.) Please add more option on how we select our writings.. another app has great example about this.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It provides very useful functionality, but UI is too traditional and old fashioned. Should try to adopt simple and clean UI and design with more pleasing user experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it on my note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application for quick note taking. Going to try it on my tablet as well to see how I like it on a bigger screen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"First I was just using his app to draw and take hand written notes. Though, I soon figured out about the weakness of android's PDF writing app community.  This was the last app I would have ever guessed would be the best for annotating PDFs! Its the only app that's half smooth; all the rest lack features or have some large quirk that makes me avoid them. PERFECT! You saved android's weak PDF writing app community for me! Thanks!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Sync feature is a single huge file needs to be updated, that will take a lot of time if there's lots of PDF and images imported. And dropbox on the PC end will had to download a huge file every time it is synced.. The Papyrus database should be more optimized so it will be broken down into small files instead of one huge file. plus, it can't specify update time every day, always try to update when i go to a slow wifi location"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Mainly the issue is when it's doing backups to drop box. It would be great to be able to schedule the times as it takes ages and always seem to happen at the worst time!  Awesome product but data loss is a big deal"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"yet good for taking quick notes . I like it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Request : please include synchronization  feature. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is great and has helped me immensely, the only issue is having to use my finger to erase due to the S-pen not working with the button.   I know this is an issue with samsung's control with the button BUT a workaround that papyrus developers could use is to press the button while hovering above the screen to turn to eraser for the next screen touch. (this is how LectureNotes works.  If this feature is somehow implemented, I will be immediately buying all premium features on this app because other than that it is wonderful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is beautiful just the tool I needed, so much it made me abandon the snote app from Samsung"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Really great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a very good app. Since i discovered papyrus i didn't use SNote anymore. But the opportunity to make folders would be very very usefull. So please, implement this! After that, the app would be perfect :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! Super usefull."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app I've used so far. Prefer over Lecture notes. Using bamboo feel S-Pen.  2 issues- -Needs support for Google Drive sync -My palm tends to shift the page sometimes, any help on how to stop this from happening in settings would be appreciated!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Zoomed out by accident... When I zoomed back in, wasnt on my note anymore. When I used both fingers to scroll, the edges went grey so I couldn't see if I was going the right way. Tried for 5 minutes, finally deleted the more and uninstalled the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app, but wish I could write across the whole width and height of the screen. Have a galaxy note 8"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"...for my day to day note taking and sketches of ideas."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app I've found. Particularly great with Galaxy Note 10.1 2014."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is so useful. I use it everyday."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It will be better if there was palm recognition and a better version to ease typing instead of moving the page every time the screen is full(good notes has that feature)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app - in that it provides good features and executes them beautifully. Features = import bookmarks and annotate them in all ways; make free-form notes and notebooks; export all kinds of note-documents into PDF;  Save; and then Share them via email or adding to Dropbox.   The feature I feel is missing is ""automatic syncing to Dropbox"" -- I find it so many times that I want to access my docs somewhere, and have not explicitly Exported them. There needs to be a way to control this feature - basically, I want to designate a document to be always sync'd to Dropbox by default. That is, the ""Save"" command should function as Sync. Also, it should remember where in my Dropbox folder structure the document should go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use this app.....but u should have setup separate pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It works well and does what I would like, but expensive in app purchases and a lack of tools to do things like save figures or drawings and insert them later leaves me just a bit wanting. Biggest thing missing is the auto-advancing writing on a line ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is essential to Note users as far as I'm concerned. It's replaced my notebooks and sketchpads for my daily work and personal life."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Good.. but lack many intuitive featues... cant delete a page..cant create additional space.. very limited functionality.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app with my Galaxy Note 10.1. By far the best app for taking hand written notes. The cloud backup to Dropbox and pdf annotation are also a life saver for me. Definitely need a proper wacom stylus to take full advantage of the software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for note taking at work or at home. Haven't tried any of the premium features yet but getting by just fine with the free version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have had others that I liked when using ios, but this meets my needs.  The only issue I.have had is moving notes to folders.  I like the simplicity.  I use it for all note taking on my note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used to use S Note because it has a lot of nice features but the button placement and laggy UI did not please me. Papyrus is much smoother and has everything on the top so that my palm doesn't accidentally touch it! Very pleased with how simple it is while maintaining very useful functionality, such as multi-window support. Highly recommend to students who want to take notes on a tablet!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like everything about this product except the file management.   I would recommend it and will struggle with the FM until they improve it."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, clean and simple."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the best note apps around, very user friendly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using the S note app for a year and I really wasn't satisfied with it. The S note app is slow to respond, and papyrus works faster.  The papyrus app is more applicable to the classroom setting. Of course to get the best and most of the app you're going to have to pay for it. But if you want to take notes on your tablet use this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is MADE for galaxy note,or if you plan on using a stylus on android you cannot skip this app. MUCH LOVE FOREVER."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I haven't explored all its options yet, but from what I see, it would be great for short notes or reminders . . .or if you left all your paper and pens in the void!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've tried dozens of apps for writing notes on my Tegra Note. This one exactly meets my requirements. There's a bug, though. It randomly stops detecting DirectStylus as an active device sometimes. *** Edit: I've found the bug. Changing it to portrait mode and back seems to do the trick. Inconvenient to do it every time. :/"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Getting stuck at 92%"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice alternative to s notes. But it needs to be more adsjutable. Less clicks more development. And why the pan screen gets transparent when moving the page? If they fix it, this app will be perfect for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Please reduce the price :-("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"How dare this app assume the role of default app for opening pdfs and then throw up an in app purchase for that functionality.  It clearly seems that you are trying to trick users into purchasing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best App's for very Quick notes it looks like a 3x5 card, for out side sales its the best. I like better then S. Note. Thank you for this free App."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The ability to scroll and zoom a uge page means you can take unlimited notes and sketches. An awesome application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"LOVE this app. Needs cloud syncing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"For quick note taking it's pretty good but it only supports Dropbox and (rather strangely) Box for cloud sync, why no Google Drive? Does anyone even use Box?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use very handy for my students"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Exactly what I was looking for to make flow charts and notes. It needs Google Drive support, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a Galaxy S5 (or any phone that had increased touch sensitivity), turn on the Increase Touch Sensitivity and you can use a regular lead #2 pencil and write on the screen as if you were writing on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! Perfect for what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very well done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This a great note taking app that compliments Samsung ' S Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I try to use passive stylus and it doesn't work ,however it works when you use finger. How I can take notes with the finger ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy n extremely responsive. Also eraser is brilliant"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app.  Perfect for students. Paying extra for the Tool Pack is totally worth it. Only gave it 4 stars because the developers still need to add a few features (namely connecting to Google drive, allowing the export of entire notebooks rather than 1 note at a time, inserting pages into imported pdfs, and creation of sub-folders for better organization). But in all honesty, this app is amazing and greatly surpasses the other note-taking interfaces available. Would've given it 4.5 if that were possible. I have a Galaxy Note Pro and it works wonderfully with the S Pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Didn't work very well with the s-pen on the note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It wont let me write anything! Uninstalling!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very handy and good to take notes on. The writing is perfect for note taking and the opinion to change the colour is good for identifying different things."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is awesome for taking notes with the spen on the note 10.1. I just wish the premium features hadn't been so expensive. But they do work beautifully. Needs to sync across devices for 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app out there, smooth and light app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful app, vector grahics and the note book system comebined with a fair amount of settings make this app very easy to use and enjoyable to use. However, it lacks the ability to choose where you save your notes, this forces you to use up your internal storage, even when you pay for the App! It has also caused some weird glitchs for me, but a quick restart seemed to resolve them. Very good, but there is a lot of room for improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Buy it if you want to master note taking in college."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"S-note keeps crashing recently. Did a quick search, installed and was pleasantly surprised with this app. So far, no problems"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Feel like a real paper!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love the infinite scrolling. It's a much more natural way of taking notes on a tablet, if that makes any sense. I''ve found S Note to be pretty annoying because the pages are ridiculously small and I would have to have countless pages just for one lecture of notes. Whereas, with infinite scrolling, I can keep on going uninterrupted, or I can add another page if the topic changes or if I just feel that it's getting too long.  This would be 5 stars if the S pen wrote more smoothly on the app. It writes well enough, but for someone who is OCD it gets rather irritating. Could this please be fixed? The S pen, writes amazingly well on the S Note application, but it feels a bit jerky on this application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"ชอบครับ"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its usefull."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would to be able to type the text and see it in the page directly, instead of typing it in a box and then getting it into the document."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it every day on my galaxy note for work and private topics. The option to edit and move lines flexibly makes a great improvement compared to traditional note taking with pen and paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"l use it on my Samsung 10.12014 Edition ,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Innovative"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app for all my engineering lecture notes, homework assignments, and back-of-napkin calculations on my Galaxy Note II and my Galaxy Note 10.1. I export and email PDFs of all three every day for work and school. The ability to import and write directly on a PDF, the shape tools, and highlighter tools are a must. I'm just mildly annoyed they nickel and dime you for those. I'm also mildly annoyed you can't delete or rearrange pages. That would make this a five star app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"ability to write with the Note3's Pen stylus and erasing with your finger is a brilliant idea."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Solid app.  Questionable future.  I started with Papyrus before they had PDF annotation and have purchased each of the premium packages (not cheap by Play store standards).  Each release lead to Papyrus becoming a better note taking tool.  Most recent updates seem to ignore most commonly requested user items according to their feature request website.  Instead the development team focused on Presentation mode and Chromecast support?  Unfortunately, there is low availability of quality note taking/PDF annotation apps for Android, but Papyrus is among the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I recently came across with other note taking app ""Class Note"". It have better writing experience as compared to our Papyrus. But papyrus is way too good from all other perspective...  Thanks for such great app.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does a great job, easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just get it ....  it's like a smart board! !!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a month now for my studies and it works great. It is so much more efficient than taking paper notes. It's easy to use and I can organize my notes in different folders. I highly recommend using this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for Note 2014"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"but I hate apps that hide your data in /data."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Works but needs more feature. Willing to pay too, for those features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the update. Conversion to pdf is fast.   Can you fix the refresh rate so that when I scroll up and down I won't see a bunch of squares on the screen?   I use this app 6 hours a day teaching math to my students. I email the notes to my students after I finish tutoring them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use and include images while working on a note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus flows well. More responsive than s note. I would like to see a feature to display a note as a widget on the home screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thankyou...i love it.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just I also tend to use it as a journal at times and I would like to see the ability to remove the ""Recent Notes"" tab. Or set a default page grouping to open up to. 5 stars after that!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and versatile, also you can add to it or not as you like. I have it on all my devices. Great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Try it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App keeps draining my battery on my Galaxy Note2 :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this to take notes in all my classes.  I love this app but i wish it had just 1 in app purchase for everything instead of 5 or whatever it is at now. It was made for the galaxy note series of devices and is pressure sensitive when paired up with the pen.  It now has PDF important which is a featured you have to pay for (one time purchase), but in my opinion,  it's totally worth it.  It has notebooks to organize your notes by subject.  You can PDF export your notes which is great for sharing notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is the most versatile note taking app on the market. Great features. However it does not include two features possessed by it's rival ""Write"" These are 1) Ability to create handwritten  bookmarks in the document    2) Ability to reflow text. That means add space in between of paragraphs easily to add more  information later. These two features are so crucial that most students  switch to ""Write""  even though it has limited capabilities."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"hope add function auto sync to Dropbox or Google Drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love Papyrus as a handwriting app and have been using it exclusively for that function all throughout college. I am, however, disappointed with their text tool. If only they had the ability to write directly on the page instead of forcing open a separate input box and then not automatically wrapping text to the next line I would continue to use the app. As is, if you use both handwriting and typing lecture notes is the better app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you ...keep up the good work :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only complaint is the small lag when scrolling through the page. Sent a note to support; fix this and five stars for sure!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice on my 10.|"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does what is supposed to do. Very neat"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's a good note taking app and the second best on the market. It falls way short on the drawing tools and the ability to save custom pens. I'm in college and use lecturenotes because the custom tools and ability to save pens makes taking notes in class a breeze. It also lacks the ability lecture has with organization (keywords, indexing, and search) it's almost there, but needs some fine tuning. A really good app though and I did pay for all the additional features. If you need a basic note taking app and don't require a lot of extras or intense organization this is the one for you. I do like the actual flow of writing in this app better than lecture, but without the other features I have to place this as a backup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This  is a good aap in use our Daly work and outher  work this app halp for notes"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Simply stunning app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"the only thing that its better then the notes that comes with the galaxy note is that its more ""fit to screen"" (something you can really adjust actually in the notes, but it looks nice), the ability to select the text and edit it (increase\decrease size, change colors, etc.), more comfortable editing tools location. but thats it! it DOES NOT support the gestures of excess to those tools like it promises!!! and the text editing tools are limited (no outline or bold text options), but you can change the location of the text, and change its color and size, which can be nice. for conclusion: its really bad for a company to promise something and not come through, which i would have deducted 2 stars for it, but the convenience of taking notes is pretty good, and if  they had the option of hand write detection (meaning detect what you write in your own hand write and  convert it to text) would have been a great achievement for 5 stars all it need is to  fix their promise with the gestures (which is come through or remove the idea), to add more text editing tools, and add some kind of text reading algorithm (or just buy it from someone and add it to their app). other then that its nice"

It also excluded moving of notes from one notebook to another. Further, I would have enjoyed the app's ability to provide cloud support if we can organise the cloud manually.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Does basically most of all I need to do. I would prefer If I could write and then convert to text later. As soon as I find an app that does that I guess I'm done with Papyrus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is a great app. I use it to take notes on pdf files. However I would like to request an update. It would be awesome if you can include an option to add a page into my imported pdf. Sometimes the notes won't fit in 1 page. It would be nice to add 1 page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This is the second time I lost all my notes. Uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"addresses  the needs!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for handwritten note taking, simple sketching and so on, just like a notepad. Need a good stylus/tablet combination, though, for best results. I user it to take notes in church, and for simple sketches, drawings etc. Ideas can be quickly sketched out and emailed as a PDF. Very handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I am still waiting for some kind of spen side button integration"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My second review and I found this much better to use with an active pen. It seems to detect a greater range of pen pressures compared to S Note but doesn't have the templates S Note has. Also you need to pay for the features S Note gives for free so I'm sticking with S Note for now"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If I can really highlight words in PDF mode, I will give this app five star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The features are worth buying,  love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, but I have a few problems with them. One is that only the Spen is working on my note 8 after using the app after a while. Another is that I want to buy premium features, but I would like to have it in one price for all instead of them individually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Impressive ""natural note"" manager, the best for classroom math notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great if you have a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Need support for Google Drive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I tried several handwriting apps (S-Notes, lecturenotes, ezPdf) heavily, papyrus is the best one in terms of handwriting and pdf annotating.  Still, several important features are missing: bookmark is one; page turning is horrible if one works on a long document. Also, the price on the additional features is too steep.  4 stars for the nice writing capabilities."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This App very useful in my business. Needs Search ability!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it every Day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But if it is colourful it might be more impreesive. Overall its really excellent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works great on my Galaxy Note 8 and Galaxy Nexus! If only it could make me draw better... Lol"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this apps all the time and very handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice soft for spen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please allow deleting page(s).. other than that, topnotch.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There's really nothing else like it. I use it to import PDF blueprints and mark them up for changes, or highlighting, etc. Great for contractors!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Reasonable pen support, good organization, excellent export to pdf feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application is my paper replacement. Exceptional with the Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Without google drive it is not worth putting on my tablet. I plan to purchase all in app purchases once this major overlook is fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very expensive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app doesn't try to do too much. It does a few simple things, perfectly. My thanks to the developers. I love the pdf add-on too. It is great for editing and math notes. Grid paper = awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I do love Papyrus but then there is something wrong with it. I can't write anymore since the ersaser tool is the only one that can be used. I tried clicking the pen button buut then what appears is the eraser button all the time. Can u pls do domething about this..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works in multi-windows mode, so I can take notes from other sources. Never lags. Note 3, 8, and 10.1 2014."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Nice features, but like most note taking apps like this they're useless for people who are left handed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The business"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I liked it a lot. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is ok but the reason I'm uninstalling is because it is to difficult to erase notes, I mean you can hit the undo button but that only removes one letter at a time. When you want to remove the entire note at once it's like a three steps process"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of my favorite Android apps. I use it to present and annotate PDFs of my presentations in class. The new presentation mode is something I had been  waiting for and now that it' here, the app is almost perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Good idea doesn't work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It would be good if you could make it possible to change theme, I'm not a blue color fan, but great, perfect app thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great note app. But please add cross device note syncing, that's missing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better app but need to improve"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app- works brilliantly with Note 10. I"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish it had handwriting recognition. It still wins out over my other note taking apps for the s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally no more catching things off the fax, only to fill out n send back thru, Now the paper never has to be pulled off the computer, you can fill it out n email it right back without even touching a pen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for all my lecture notes and research scribble. PDF import/export doesn't destroy links or text. I use it for signing my signature to forms and adding light notes to PDFs, but more commonly use ebookdroid for reading them. This is a constantly improving app, but it's worth the money right now if you do a lot of writing.  Until it reaches some kind of final form, expect a kind of a la carte approach to the biggest features. There are many free updates, though it doesn't seem that handwriting recognition is coming any time soon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"even on my phone with stylus. Who needs a special phone or tablet? It would be even better if it does character recognition! HTC One 4g (4.4.2) updates-  v1.1.6-GP: no specific waznew; 1.1.4GP applied update but no version number in "" What's New "" section on G-play"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Won't let me do anything now so Uninstalling since I can get better notes for free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome note app I ever used..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An excellent app but seems to slow a little after having a lot of notes"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to replace my notepad at my desk"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is one of my most used apps!  The one feature I would love to see is the ability to snap to the background grid and finer control over that grid.  Otherwise, three thumbs up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would recommend this app for anyone who takes notes seriously. Love all the features, great support."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app I've tried for writing maths on a tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very good app , very useful for taking notes on pdf files and during meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Easy to make notebooks and notes. Exactly what I wanted!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The Best app of its Type"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Job well done."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app. This has set the standard for taking, editing, and saving apps. I upgraded to edit PDFs. Does what Adobe should have done long ago.  I highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"zooming out a lot then drawing somewhere on the bottom left only end up with a very big pdf (size, not space wise), and there no direct way to export to local storage (sd), i end up having to exporting to dropbox then export to sd from there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is the best handwritten note-taking app I could find, but even with a stylus, it's still too slow to actually use for in-class note-taking, unfortunately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Since I bought my Samsung note I left behind tons of paper thanks to Papyrus, which makes it possible through the easiest way."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Write with s-pen, finger to erase, 2 fingers to scroll and zoom. Quick and easy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An excellent app.  I'm paying for the premium features as a support but this is too much.... :-\"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Brilliant.  Plz improve by including different gestures such as automatic openning the app if u remove the pen. Currently using Action list for this purpose. Th"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very cool, gives a feel like you are writing on a Paper! I recommend this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Verynice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need. To make it even better, it would be good if there was a widget that shows my recent notes. But so far I have had no issues with the app itself."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Will pay for extra features when I need them"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Im using Snote but I found this app is better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Aowesome, I solve many issues were in S Note. I wish if there are More productivity backgronds like checklist"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"S-Note is ok, but after Samsung dropped support for importing PDF's, I gave up on it. Papyrus works perfect for dealing with PDF documents. I can import lots of school assignments, do the mark up, take the notes, etc. and export them to dropbox. From there the notes are synced to my other devices. It works well with the Bamboo Stylus and the opposite side of the pen can be used as an erasure. Another win for Papyrus agaist S-Note. Zooming and locking of zooming levels is very customizable. Again unlike S-Note. Well worth the asking price for the in-app stuff."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I am a college student taking notes in engineering courses. But since Steadfast has perfected the writing ability of this app so much, I feel good just drawing meaningless lines. It's not as feature flashy as some other 5 star writing apps out there, but no other app FEELS as good as Papyrus. The efficiency and features will come, and when they do, the competition will be blown away."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simple and gets the job done.  Not as many options as other similar programs but does the basics very well.  Won't drive you crazy with a millions options to tweak before you can use it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best when used for math, art, sketches without the presence of paper. Would be better if you could save in an offline format accessible on desktop apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Can you add the option to change the size of files icons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"How are people using this app for note taking? Are these fake positive reviews?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over a year now, & I love its functionality. Great way to write anything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its great for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app. Would it be possible to make the import pdf function import whole folders? I would love that!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Having now tried pretty much every 3+ star rated handwritten note-style app in the marketplace, I can confidently say that this is the best one by a LONG shot.  To be clear, I use a Galaxy Note 10.1 - and with that form factor in mind (i.e., an active pen), it's fantastic for note taking.  It also works very well as an ebook - provided you load them in as PDFs.  It could use some features to round out its usability - but I mean this in the sense of MS Office needing improvements, not NeoOffice - that is to say: the tool is complete as is and very good, but obviously it's not perfect.  If you're looking for an all-purpose handwriting app, I HIGHLY recommend getting it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for writing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Test couples of note taking software, this the best i tested. Especially for Handwriting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With a pen. Amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great, everything is kept neatly and I do not need to carry around a big notebook. Keep up the good work..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than s note imho, more intuitive and the editing is less clunky. Really needs Save As functionality though..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not bad not great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It's OK for taking notes I guess but I was looking to take notes on a pdf.   You have to pay to do that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loved it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfection..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Whatever you wanna draw, write, design, you can do with this app. Your own personal infinite notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good note app. Hope the text feature i paid for works again for my Note 3 . Previously text size was too small."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Update/mod to my original review.  The pressure sensing feature of the Tegra Note 7 is not supported.  Enabling pressure sensitivity requires enabling active pen which causes all sorts of trouble on the Tegra Note 7.  Too bad--I'd give it five stars if it worked."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"After in app purchases, which are not cheap, it is more versatile than s note. Don't forget to watch the tutorials. July 4 update: had to reset the phone and couldn't get my notes back into the app, had to import them to Evernote instead, hence the demise of Papyrus on this phone. Evernote took over."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lovely app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a neat app.  The add-ons are a bit too expensive for what they do.  I prefer S-note though.  Of course that only works if you have a Samsung."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app would not boot and froze my phone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is the closest thing to pencil and paper available for an S-pen tablet. In settings, check the box that says that you have an S-pen device. Also, check the box that prevents the editor from closing when the back button is pressed and you have full palm rejection. Buy the S-pen toolkit, and you get a true (finger) eraser. Without the toolkit you can erase with your finger, but only full strokes..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greate app! I use it every day in meetings to take notes, less disruptive than typing.  I do wish you could search handwritten notes for specific words, like SNote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool. Making notes becomes so natural. Signing PDF documents very easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but needs a better UI."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Extremely helpful!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have struggled with the snotes slow response and I felt there was always something missing It felt Unnatural and sometimes slow to respond. Papyrus is easy very simple and quick Just what I need. The only problem is that you have to pay for any extra feature even the most basic ones like more writing tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No password protect and could not just type. Uninstalling!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is great for my galaxy note 10.1.  I use this app every day for my work check list."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app does everything I would want a note taking app to do (drawing with a stylus style note taking). It works really nicely, has great tools, copy and paste, undo, eraser, easy to use, and somehow doesn't seem to get confused when I rest my hand on my tablet while writing.  It even has a setting to disable the back button within the app, which is great for me since I tend to press it by accident when resting my hand. It also syncs to dropbox.  A couple things do cost extra, but it's well worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great on galaxy note 2. I love it so much more than snote and note everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for studies"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. Great substitute for Action memo from Samsung note. Very useful if you have a pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to click the number for font size instead using the slider.  Harder to pick a font sometimes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Enable tools (oval, straight line, rectangular shape and high light pen) are worth to purchase! It's better note experience. Kudos!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extremely handy. Cheers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I downloaded and tried several on my  Note 8.0 tablet and this was the only one that did everything I needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent if u use a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I don't know what the heck happened. I was viewing my notes normally and then all of the sudden, all of my writings in a note are disappeared. What the crap? Is there a gesture that would delete everything? I have a total of three notes. One is completely blank now. All my data that I have accumulated are completely gone! Seriously. I paid for every features and now I can't trust this with stability issue."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it a lot for temporary quick notes before placing in a separate management system"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far, it works great. Easy and intuitive. Thanks guys."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app it pretty great! I loved that it gives you the ability to wrote on PDF files and mail them. I only wish it was a bit more compatible with my note 3. I ran into issues when I wanted to open a file with this app but was unable to because the phone wouldn't provide it as an option.  They should also look into allowing you to import different types of files that can be written on, such as jpegs, mpegs, word docs, and excel sheets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"giving 4 stars because as much as its a great app it's lacking basic things in note taking apps.eg automatically moving the paper with writing. more tools! o"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Bast"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good onee"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It feels clunky on the 7inch screen and makes it hard to use. Probably a good app on a bigger screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Serious lag on the left margin for Samsung 10.1 note 2014 since the samsung update. Also, the finger eraser lags and sticks to the stylus only (I cant use my finger for scrolling,  erasing,  etc).  Please fix this issue.  Please allow us to fix the infinite margins - infinite scrolling down but not to the side."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One thing missing to go on 5 stars: Auto scroll page when reaching the edge. Otherwise it gets too disruptive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Sinply put: sketching done right"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Definitely the best app for handwritten note taking I've tried so far! My only gripe is that when I write on PDFs I think doesn't offer me the option of NOT saving the changes. I use my tablet for business presentations and would rather not HAVE to go back through every single page and delete notes before I go again. I have to use Foxit for that it loads pages MUCH faster and gives me that option. If that was addressed then definitely a 5/5 app for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent business tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Readily available wherever I need ad good as my notebook, simply love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I still think that this is awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Basically the best app I have ever used. LITERALLY!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For a free version you get a ton of features. Impressive. Very close to my S Note features on my Samsung Note 8. The more l use it the more l like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For a pen utility application for the Note 3 and Note 12.2 it is spectacular in it's user friendliness, in its application for use in academics and in illustrative design"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Cant write anythings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Seriously useful on the Samsung tab pro 12.2. A good functionality to add would be to enable insertion/deletion of pages in notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far the best note app for android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Where has this app been ? The nearest thing to real writing . Wait ! It is  real writing !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Only app I've found that easily let's me write and highlight onto pdf.  Wish I could keep a toolbar open so I could easy switch from pen to highlighter etc.  For the Samsung note pro 12.2, I wish I could insert a picture from my scrapbook.  I also can't find out how to save my pdf with the edits so I can access it in another app.  Wish I could have multiple files open go I could have my edited textbooks and my notes open at the same time. Organization of notes is decent, but it would be easier if I could have a list view instead of thumbnails.  This app has made my note pro far more productive.  Just fix these things and it would truly stand alone among a field of mediocre pdf editors."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Works very nicely. Quite happy with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Always room for improvement but not bad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very handy with my client meetings. Hope developers will provide more free features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be 5 star, if it had a way to make text larger. My eyes are still good but are older, too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app I have used.  All notes are backed up on dropbox as a back up file and as a pdf file.  Easy to organize notes in different files."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this to take all of my class notes on my tablet. Great app to hold everything in 1 place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lets me make quick notes in my own hand - what could be better?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried a lot of note taking apps and this is the best for me. A nice clean, uncluttered interface and good, useful functionality. One of the things that is important to me is the ability to easily annotate PDFs. Papyrus is the way to go--it does cost extra for that and several other tools I want, but for the ability to do something I really need to do it is well worth it. I didn't think I would use the 'add-image' function, but it turns out to be very handy and again easy to use. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"really great interface and paper design. Best PDF writer on market right now. also love the organization. Would be good if they added a feature that will enable layout change for the paper....like checklist, recipe, or even add voice clips"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice app but has functionality limitations that make it a no-go for me: * The toolbar isn't permanently visible, so it takes several clicks to switch between the various tools. Gets really clunky when you need to switch regularly. * No scroll by swiping, and no continuous page display  * Page navigation is done by either hitting the forward or back key , or pressing the page number and spinning through all the pages - takes forever on a large document  * Phone app freezes on large PDFs  *Zoom level doesn't hold when you change pages  * Pasting text from other apps doesn't wrap the text - just sticks it in as one long line Lecturenotes has a bigger learning curve but provides all of this and lots more, so I've adopted that as may primary note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great app and developers keep making improvements"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs palm rejection and more auto shapes like arrows and banners. Maybe an add on shapes pack"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got this app to jot down random items.  It works great for that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thank you thank you thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for my note, I just wish the extras came with the full edition rather than payed add-ons"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Typing is a distraction while putting down new ideas. jotting down a quick thought is very creative"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"natural...!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have come to really like this app and use it almost daily.  But the absolute worst thing about it and drives me crazy almost every day is palm rejection.  Nothing worse than writing a note and suddenly the page moves up.  Please fix!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is definitely the best note taking app on the play store.  I needed an app for taking notes in class on my Galaxy Note 8 and tried a large variety of the apps on the play store and this one stood out above all the others.  The option of infinitely scrolling pages is invaluable when drawing large diagrams or writing down long calculations and the pdf export is great.  Although there is some room for improvement, the app designers are actively working on any issues and are taking good feedback from the users. This app continually gets better and better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be better if this can be sync across my different Android device."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, wish I didn't have to pay for some additional features though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best app avaitable for taking freehand notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does exactly everything I'm after in a note taking app. PDF import is a must have feature for professionals needing to review documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is far better than the built in hand writing program.  The customizations and PDF import are handy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for. Works great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is fun and useful for writing a note or drawing ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm a artist and I find not only is it a good note app but sketch app as well,  I would love to see a painter app from you. Also simplicity of the interface makes it better in terms of sketchbook pro interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What are the advantages of this over s note?   How do I sync recorded sound to the note during a lecture and playback a video of the sound and me writing?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just downloaded it. I need a stylus but so far I am very impressed with the design and layout. It reminds me of an app Google would make, and that's a good thing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I keep my time sheets scratched on this.  Love that the page size is unlimited"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the app I use most on my tablet. Probably the best note taking app out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great tool for note taking.  I rarely use an actual note pad since I downloaded this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It can do everything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It says it can't save it to my SD card."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Useful and powerful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant on note 10.1 2014"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A little expensive but very useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app!! Thank you for fixing the multiwindow feature so quickly from the last update!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Installed this app as an alternative to sNote by Samsung but it just doesn't work the way I need it to. First off, to get any sync to cloud or to be able to type you need to pay $9.00. Second, the text boxes do not align with each other when you choose the txt input and enter text in more than one entry. Third, there is no way to use it on more than one device without paying for the functionality again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even though you have to buy some add one, this app is the best. I can import and EXPORT in pdf format. So no proprietary export be like the others. This is better than snote in the sense that it won't screw up the import of pdf and make it unreadable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It is of no use without palm rejection. How can any note-taking app call itself note-taking without a palm rejection feature ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"work great with the s-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I draw, take notes it's great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is a wonderful note taking app.  Compliments the s Pen well.  Also syncs across devices if you use the cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app on the play store.  A must have app for my business! Samsung Note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The more I use this app the more I like it. It has a lot of really convenient features that other note taking apps don't seem to have.  Update: thanks for fixing the multi window problem!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Would definitely purchase this app if it had the ability to add new pages in the middle of a notebook. Without this functionality it is unusable for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I really don't like in app payments. However it Was the cost v's features that convince me to buy an alternative that does a lot more for about the same price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking and prioritizing, no other note taking app compares. The app creators seem to be very interested in feedback and strive to make this app very user friendly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best & comfi.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Hero to trees! Totally replaces paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A few things I would change about the file management , but is a great app for Samsung Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best note taking app there is on the android market comparing to Snote, for some reason, the writing seems a bit more pixelated than snote.  The export ability is quick and swift.    one thing i would say is that in view only mode, i wish you can make the whole pdf flow like you do in adobe, not through page turns.  other than that. amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I wish I could love this app, but the lines come out too jittery when your writing.  Until that's fixed I won't buy the upgrades."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app daily to take notes in school on my Note 3.  There really isn't a reason why we shouldn't be able to export the notes locally, especially when the document needs to be used on the device anyway and when there isn't an Internet connection.  Also, there really needs to be a feature to add, rearrange, and remove pages from BOTH PDF and note documents."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Okay"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the features. The writing could be a lot smoother.  I tend to use this over s-note just because of functionality. But s note performs a lot better... as long as it's not lagging."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've tried lots of note taking apps & papyrus continues to be the best.  The great: Hand writing is natural. Infinite page. Works in multi screen mode. The good: The ability to select & move things. Needs free rotate & free transform everything. Export to pdf/jpg.  The bad: Pasting & typing text.  The text doesn't adjust to the text box so you have to enter when you want a new line. No font options.  Button on SPen isnt integrated, the option shows up but doesnt work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The development is great and the writing experience on it resemble the natural feeling of writing on paper. But regrettably last update removed the multiwindow that was useful to Note users, instead you could find a way to make it on/off option on settings. Also I would like to see ability to have customized cover and shelves otherwise this great app will still look cheap.    Successful app = improvements + customers satisfaction.  You are on right way to archive it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best S-pen note App I've come across so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"None of Apps like Papyrus! It has really greatly smooth writing performance and its PDF feature is just great. I've never seen the App that can load PDF fast and writing on it immediately."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a very good app...4 stars is given as it would be useful to have some additional functionality such as rotating shapes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome for PDF files.  The filing system is also user friendly, unlike S-Note.  My only complaint is text size when transcribing or using handwriting to text mode. Letters are too small."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is hands down the best note-taking app I've used. If you have a tablet with a proper stylus, definitely give this app a go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So far the best hand note app I have tried."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beats all other application hands down. Simple to use, looks great and superior functionalities."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's easier to think and take notes without the hassle of paper.  I like the notebook feature. Very user-friendly.  Glad I found it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Compared to Snote, this app is a lot better because of the autosave function. I lost my note while using Snote before as it crashed and closed the app automatically. However, it might be better for the app to add additional type of stationary that we can use (Pencil, brush, etc) for better notetaking variety."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying this. I might even buy the full version. Forgot to mention I am using the Galaxy Tab Pro 8""."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app Thanks a lot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works very well even without the S pen. My device (Google Nexus 10) is pressure sensitive so it does the exact same thing with just a normal stylus. I love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I started using it for PDF files. Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add functionality to generate and save PDf in device. That would get 5 stars from me!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Amazing app... just need the option to store on google drive!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed to note down an idea or a quick ""to do"" while on the move."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Samsung Note 3. Lots of  add-on$, adds up, but still my personal favorite for handwritten notes.  Especially nice for the active stylus machines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This has the basis of a good writing application, especially with the S-pen.   But it needs a working tool bar with easy selection of tools such as pens, colors, and other writing tools.  The current interface is not very efficient.  I expect it to improve (and hope that it improves).  I would certainly love to have in this application different nibs for pens instead of the plain vanilla pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fun to use!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Writing with the spen is extremely smooth!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good interface. Pretty handy for scribbling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 for work and personal use. I do survey work and usually get one shot at what I need to document.  My first day out I put all my notes in S NOTE. When I got back to the office I found out that I completely lost all of the notes I took! After doing some research, it was clear that this is a problem not uncommon. Thankfully I came across Papyrus.  From that point on I've put my complete trust in this app. The backup features are seamless. It's easy to use. Exactly what I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for medical school mostly, and this app single-handedly makes my Note Pro 12.2 purchase worthwhile. Highly recommended. The infinite paper alone makes Papyrus stand out above any other solution I've tried."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and so straight forward to use. The help option is the icing on the cake. Well done!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank u for giving this to us for free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick and simple navigation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs some more pen add-ons as som sketching apps ..   and improve the write tool to edit notes directly w/o marking it like s note for example .. Maybe a cleaner UI would be appreciated"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great with S pen on galaxy note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. Dropbox backup of PDFS and ability to import and annotate a PDF are excellent. Infinite paper and customisable zoom and palm versus pen recognition are very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Is it possiblr toscroll around without all thr checkered backgrounds appearing??????  AT LEAST IN VIEW ONLY MODE????"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love it use it to take meeting notes  4 stars because of the cost of extras and the way it is packaged ... uploads to Dropbox and other storage should be included in a paid version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect in its simplicity. Even my toddler loves it. I use it for UX design, maps, and doodles.  Wish this synced with Evernote. Actually Evernote should buy you, and replace Skitch. You're that good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Best in class app. Does what it says on the box"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"We people can make very good use of this. It can help save paper and is a fun and new concept. Keep it up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the app but, I have problems dragging my hand over the paper, then the sheet moves out from under me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Clean and simple interface. As close to actually writing on paper as I've ever experienced. Using a Note 3. Definitely worth the few bucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love being able to easily move handwriting, text or images around... or make the most out of space on the page by zooming in."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great replacement for action memo and it even auto sync to different cloud services. Worth it for note scribblers like me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Did everything I needed. Great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used the app for awhile now and the new PDF import has really helped improve it a lot"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I think there should be ""Notebook settings"" where can be set default page settings (pattern for example), because now I have to change page settings for every added page in a notebook. There's even no option to delete a page... The app is good, but it lacks some vital functionality..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Try it!! Souper..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App is nice but Add-ons far to expensive for the causal user, perhaps a bundle at a reduced cost to buy them all at once."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with some fantastic features! Only hope is that I Can use bigger font sizes in the future!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app, I use it a lot for note taking, one thing can be improved is to keep option to delete or add new pages in between pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It's a nop to me!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best one i used. Need to make the one of making adjustments on pdf for free perminantely"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use Papyrus on my Samsung 12.2 pro for mindmapping. The ""infinite"" paper setting allows you to map ideas without limit, zooming in and out as you need. Great for taking interview notes as you never have to find another piece of paper. Then send to pdf, print and off you go. I love writing with the stylus and erasing with my finger! A few more tricks that other software has got (smarter page turning, thumbnails to scan for the right page, and saved pen pre-sets, bookmark tabs) would be great additions and then it would outclass any rivals for journal writers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use Papyrus to take notes during meetings and, increasingly, in place of paper notes while working on design problems. I'll then often use it to compose better organized, more readable versions of those notes to share with team members.  It's almost as transparent a tool for recording thoughts as pen and paper but can be easily backed up with all the other digital assets that go with a project as well as duplicated and shared with others.  Being vector based makes the notes much more editable and a higher visual quality than those created by Samsung's S-Note.  My only problem at this point is that the number of notes I've created is adding up and the tools for organizing them aren't as powerful as I'd prefer. Notes can be organized into notebooks but the ability to nest those groupings or tag notes for sorting and filtering would help a lot for some of my larger projects."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool app Useful too....!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the ability to undo, resize and use my own handwriting.   I like to keep eye contact in meetings and this app makes it possible.   Furthermore I can email my notes for storage purposes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a very nice note-taking app that is easy to use. Sadly, it is sorely lacking in basic features such as moving or even deleting pages in a notebook, giving titles to pages, etc. It actually feels like the whole idea of ""notebooks"" was an afterthought. To make matters worse, it seems the devs are not longer actively supporting this app. ""In development"" features on their website sit unimplemented for years with not so much as a word from the devs. So the app was nice for its day, but it has become obsolete."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this app exceeded my expectations in every way. l used to write docs from scratch as well as marking up PDFs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works well now with recent update.. Thanks for listening to us.. :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Far superior to S Note for a professional notepad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was having some issues with the cloud services, now it is fixed with the last update. great app, very usefull, and I enjoy it very much! would be even better if I could edit pages, merge files and create folders inside folders (the only folder is the notebook)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. I had rated 4 stars because I didn't realise I could add images direct from camera. Just worked out I can do it after all so rating now 5 stars,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What I was looking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"v v Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app mostly for reminders and when I want to doodle art. I draw icons and make use of the colors to get the most into my notes &lt;3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've tried quite a few, and this is my favorite.  There are a couple of features I'm waiting for before I'll give it the 5th star.  1.) Cloud synchronization between devices. I take most of my notes with my Galaxy Note 10.1, but sometimes I want to look at them on my Note 2. 2.) Customizable toolbar for my favorite pen configurations. One click would be better than two (or does it currently take three?)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I have switched to this app purely for the strength of the PDF import feature, being able to export that same PDF late once it is covered in my handwritten notes and still have the original text selectable/searchable is fantastic!  Beats the hell out of Samsung's S-Note. ***** Great to see feedback was listened to and highlighter tool now has separate ' current colour' ***** I like that users have the ability to suggest features at the feedback page but there are some features that are ""planned"" but were requested 2 years ago..  I understand it is time consuming but a little more effort to respond to those and communicate with users about upcoming features etc would be great!  It is a reason another note taking app is so popular."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is by far the best writing app i could ask for. The only thing i want for this is to have a better UI in organizing notes :)  Their handling of typewritten text (especially the copied and pasted ones) needs improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a great app which is totally compatible with S Pen, however, there’re some serious issues. First off, no page thumbnails? Seriously? Most handwriting apps have this feature. This is the most basic feature for an app like this. Why? Because not only we can navigate better with the help of page thumbnails, we can also get to re-arrange/re-order the pages,  or add a new page between the existing pages we’ve created."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An excellent app for sketching, drawing, taking notes, etc. Like using paper, but so much better. So easy and simple to use; much better than S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very exciting! A wow factor to my grandchildren. Like wow grandpa, where did you get that from?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a tool that one should not part with."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app helps me so much for keeping track of my sudden creative ideas and helping me develop them. I also take all my class notes with this. Who needs a backpack when you can use your phone? Galaxy Note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good app, although a bit pricey. Could be 5 stars if the galaxy note easy clip feature was supported."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"to say more than all praises earlier mentioned.  Just one feature request - add OwnCloud to the service."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Significant problem of not providing text box resizing.  Felix"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would like to see password protected capability and different background colors and save locally"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday on my 8 Inch tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is better than S Note. Even better after buying all the add-ons. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just one thing. Improve pdf navigation. Not having a ""find"" feature or a ""pdf chapter content"" feature is the only downfall. If you merge these features with papyrus' note taking system it would make an already mind blowing app even more mind blowing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Verry easy to share pdf document on multiple computer by keeping the pdf extention whereas the snote it's verry hard because you have to convery from .spd to pdf.  Aloso you can backup easly your file on drop box. This app is getting better cause you can vote for suggestion add one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was looking for a note taking app, and settled upon this. Not had a single problem, and it has already replaced paper in my life. The writing is fluid, enables me to share notes quickly and effectively. Brilliant app, keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this instead of default Samsung S Note for the infinite page size feature. When taking lecture notes, I need bigger pages. I hope the developers will improve this already great software. It still lacks some of fine features that S Note has, like line smoothing and custom page backgrounds. It also does not work with the Samsungs easy clip function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works fine. Just what i have been looking for ü"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just great thats all ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it's supposed to - Take notes!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Maybe its me, but I can't seem to find a way to export notes for use outsde the program. Also,  would love some flexbility in storing files other than creation date. For me, alphbetical is better. I love the natural feel will taking notes, as it is almost like using pen and paper,  without the hassle of stoing paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Whenever i put my stylus pen our my finger to the ""paper"" i could only see a square to erase things that i hadn't had the chance to write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It would be perfect if it had a widget and or alarms.  I would love to make it my note. task. shopping list. App that would remind me.  Please add this... Widgets please... Alarm.... Please"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect but it's missing page editor! And it is needed badly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent APP highly recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the app, will give it a five when we get a 4x4 widget..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for, an app to work with s pen that doesn't zoom and move paper about everytime I lean on it. Thank you. Would be great to have more writing instruments and add to Evernote support please.   Also, if I write something and then move to a different page, when I press undo, it would be great if it auto navigated back to the appropriate page that the undo is on. I hope this makes sense. Thanks devs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I an using this app constantly for work . The ability to save your notes to the cloud and sync them on different devices is amazing. As a professional having to deal with construction plans and land surveys dayly this app and my Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 made my work so much easier!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Works exactly as advertised."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time and its awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Almost close to the fundamental functions of s memo or s note, keep it up, beat the s note! This apps Beuty is with out s pen can do greet tasks! Thank you for designing good product."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this program. Note taking is accurate and natural. If they find a way to automatically sync readable notes to Google drive I'd be thrilled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Melhor editor de notas. Prefeito pro Galaxy note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best overrall S Pen note taking software I have tried among WRITE, S NOTE and INKredible. Importing PDF works greatly for me ALTHOUGH it would be great if there were basic PDF edit buttons such as ""rotate pages"" during import."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"BEST writing app hands down for Lenovo Think pad and HTC Flyer. Love how you can make the page go on forever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I hope there is going to be more features coming. No need to write on paper anymore. I do exercises and notes on my phone. Loving my s-pen more! Since I dont like touchwiz and their bloated softwares, this is perfect for my Galaxy Note 2 running Aosp based rom. Keep up the excellant work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well, easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Updates for this app seem to break it's core use. I've used it for awhile now and really love it.. But tweaks key crashing the app since they have changed it. Most recently, it crashes when I try and import images from Google Drive. Overall, the developers need to QA it a bit more before releasing an update."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Be sure to get the $2 upgrade that automatically backs up your notes to Dropbox."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great for quick, short notes to myself.   Very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app let's me write on my tablet in my own handwriting. It is easier to use than the apps that came with my tablet. I use it every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking, writing on pdfs, and concept mapping.  The ability to make the canvas go on for ever in any direction is super useful when you dont know how much space you need. I love this app and use it everyday.  Definitely earned my 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have searched for many stylus writting app and this is the best. It is simple to use and it works well on my galaxy tab pro."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find it increasingly indispensable for the meetings I attend, and find it useful for jotting down just about anything. A consistent 5 star from the first time I downloaded it almost two years ago, especially as a replacement for the default note Samsung app for those  running custom roms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for my university class note taking. It's very good, However there are some problems like lake of some shapes like arrow ... and highlight pen that snote already has them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"just useful....that's it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app won't open half the time. The icon glows as if it were about to start, but then that's it.  No app. No convenience.  I restart the app, then the phone--still nothing.  I uninstalled then reinstalled it and then lost months of notes.  This is annoying because the app is FANTASTIC otherwise.  I have a Galaxy Note 3 and use Papyrus (when it works) to do long math problems. The infinite canvas size is the greatest of its many features.  Papyrus is super easy to use. Please just work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for viewing and signing docs on my Note 3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Draw me like one of your french girls"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Handsome tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good, lacks the option of opening a document from the cloud and then save it back to the cloud"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"its great but its not free to use,i cant buy em cos i dont have creditcard.same"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for practical purposes on tablets are not high tech"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For writing on PDFs it is almost perfect. Spen works great. Take out pen, and write. That's it. Very fluid. Erase with your finger. There are a few improvements possible. E.g. page flip with volume key, faster drawing of pages. Bookmarks. Select/search on contents of PDF. Erasing highlights with finger. Keep separate colors for pen and highlighter. But, when I really mark up a document, this is my choice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"what if,, you dont have a pen and what im using for?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Down load this app and when I try to use it the only thinh I see is the highligt of a doted square arround my finger . What is wrong .? Can not use to properly evaluate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fast and intuitive,  all it's missing is a widget!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Stylus Labs' Write is superior in UX design (switching tools is quick and easy), but this app is more feature complete and in active development. I tried Lecture Notes like many Note 10.1 owners suggested, but it has a long way to go before it reaches this level of polish."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Replaces my pad of paper, incredibly useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easiest,  most reliable app for use with Samsung Note 8 for taking handwritten notes. Not too many features, but plenty for what you need and will use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Note users would love this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really it's perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. My go to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and it is almost better than S-Note now which is why I am using it now. The only thing which is bugging me is that when I am panning with two fingers, I can't see where I am scrolling to because the program doesn't allow it. It creates grey boxes like from the Photoshop background and only once you stop panning around with two fingers the program refreshes the page. If you could please update the program to make the panning more useful it would be much appreciated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would love to see this app truly rival iPad-only Notability, with the feature of notes being linked to audio recordings where you can tap play and watch your note unfold or jump to a specific point in the recording by tapping a word with the navigation tool and you’ll go to that point in the recording.  That said, Papyrus is the easiest to use note taking app I have tried, and I've tried plenty of unsatisfactory ones out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take many notes with this. Handwriting is faster than typing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best hand writing app on the market. Please allow continuous flow of pages when writing and not just page changing on the right hand side."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is just great. I use it for university. Using it as an art sketch pad due to pressure sensitive. Cannae fault it.. save trees and use this instead of outdated paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In combination with a galaxy note 10"" (spen) a true alternative to my paper notebook. Writing feels as natural as on paper.  Features I appreciate most: - Ease of selecting parts, changing their position, size, color, etc.  - Unlimited paper size. This is great, it actually adds possibilities beyond the classic notebook.  I have been looking forward to this kind of application since the iPad 1 era...  Papyrus allowed me to get rid off my paper notebooks I had to carry with me to write down ideas, concepts, etc.  Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Options to change the temple of the notebook and different types of pens would be an amazing addition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fast response without writing lag. It is now my go to app for filling out PDF forms at my office. Allows me to go paperless. Out performs Polaris 10x. Must have for any office environment.   Galaxy Note 10.1 2014"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add ons also well worth the price. Small weakness: could do with better typed text input (text wrap)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The infinite sheet is great to create mind maps and have all your thoughts and notes in a single document. I will give it a try to the non free version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Well give five stars if can incorporate conversion of written formulas to equations like S note. Otherwise this is an awesome app for handwriting!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I had started using this app but stopped because it had no PDF import.  The feature has recently been added but I won't be able to test it out because the developers are asking for 5 dollars more.  I already purchased the other premium features, I will not be spending more money.  It is extremely frustrating that I have to pay for each feature individually.  Sorry, but I have moved on to Lecture Notes.  They have a paid app and any new features get added without additional costs.  If you want a replacement that allows pdf imports, voice recordings and continues updates then I recommend Lecture Notes over this."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Even just the free version offers more than enough. It offers tools to write, save, and organize notes. It can even add pictures into a note. App works perfectly on tablets. I will definately be purchasing the full one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy place to keep memos and to do lists."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It doesn't make sense to have a note app without search note feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's great, I use it all the time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work; you can't draw anything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app but would love to see it open and annotate on power points as well.  I primarily use this for note taking at school with my note 10.1 2014 tablet.  That would be a great addition to this app. I hope the developers see this and make those changes.  Otherwise,  this app does everything I need it to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I had it on my old phone and it was great but I got a new phone and when I try to write it just shows a square dotted box fix it or tell me what i'm doing wrong and I will change my rating"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"So far, so good!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app because it lets me take notes like I do on paper, and is not bogged down with handwriting recognition. I don't need that. I also like that I can markup PDFs with natural handwriting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Happy with papyrus. Very goog app. I gave 5 star"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great. Some of the paid features are worth considering if you want to mark up pdf documents, use highlighters and other additional features, but even the free version works great and does what it issupposed to. Would definitely recommend.  One suggestion: it would be nice if I could set the ""fit page width"" or other display setting as default so that it automatically applies to new pages added within the same note. Thought the lock feature does that, but doesn't seem to work..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"1. The lite version of handwrite allows an option of handwriting or typing. 2. Trying to move a lasso'd stroke doesn't work very good. It tries to resize it. The needs to be some difference between moving & resizing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used a dozen other pen input notepads, and paid for two.  This one is free and is the best.  The onenote-like nested notebook structure and great fluid input make it stand out.  Best of all, they listen!  I requested a highlighter feature about a year ago and they just released it, and notified me that my request had been fulfilled.  Thanks Steadfast!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing!! I have been looking for this functionality forever!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app must try everyone"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application is more than what they say it is. I loved the free version so much I bought the upgrade and started using it as much for my personal notes as I do for work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The sale prompted me to purchase the premium features. This app is so far the best one I have found for taking notes and for taking notes on pdfs. A great feature to add would be a typing feature, not just a text box but a feature where you could type up a whole page on lines, like in S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add PDF support and we will  bow before your awesomeness! EDIT: PDF import was added! I now bow before your awesomeness! :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works well as a flexible note or drawing program. It can output anything you make into PDF for effortless sharing. It does not have every conceivable effect and brush, but just what I need. If what you want is a stable, simple, easy to use, fast and reliable app to write/draw notes in, this is great! Some apps lag, but this one is very fast."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the app , but I wish i had the option to make it completely full screen without the options taking some precious space on screen for mobile phones. Also a widget like s note would be truly awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is a Perfect App for my note writing,without worring about Space limitation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Integrates beautifully with my Galaxy 10.1 and its s-pen. Find very convenient to organize my documents in notebooks and notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really think this app has potential, I bought all Premium features but it really needs a set of custom pens and S-Pen button support... Will we get that?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for drawing and importing pics and writting"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried many apps for going paperless in university and this finally looks like a winner!  I use a Galaxy Note 10.1, which works great. The app is really intuitive and leaves ample room for customization via advanced settings.  I feel like the advanced features (which have to be bought seperately) are too expensive (especially when compared to other apps).  Two additional features would be greatly appreciated:   1. the possibly to switch quickly between tabs 2. Bulk import of PDFs, at the moment every PDF has to be imported seperately. For all my university material that is 50 PDFs+ so quite annoying.  Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything works excellently. Just wish there was ppt compatibility."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I do think the app itself is clever and cool but it either decides that it does want me to write/draw or get the memo that I want to write/draw! I have spent 15 minutes trying to write something and nothing. Not for my phone, I feel like I'm stupid but I've tried everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Made my days in the field easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add search function coz as number of notes increases it is difficult to find information"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I need to Read a tutorial because I maybe doing it wrong. Once I do this I reevaluate my Rating, Otherwise it Seems fairly simple . I am usinq the PRO trial features as we speak, IaM interested in uploading ''pics "" of documents and web pages -for a recipe or DIY Project directions. will Keep you all posted"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using the app for simple note taking and recommend it to others."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful for my everyday business and school work,  thanks for making it affordable!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"but exporting to pdf cannot save the newly added comment. I will give 5 starts after it is fixed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. It's especially useful during meetings where I need to write and sketch out quick. notes. Organizing notes 'is also very easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent. Pdf support and a highlighter! A simplified toolbar would be nice. Switching from  pen to highlighter shouldn't take 3 presses."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Make my poor handwriting look nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Grt...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried nearly all of the writing applications and this is the only one I use. It is quick,  logical and easy to use and I wouldn't be without it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works great on my phone, Galaxy Note, but not my Samsung Tab 2. Might just be the issue of the capacitive touch screen on the Tab. Love it on my phone, it has replaced SNote as my note taking program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Reduce your heavy load carriage of note bookkeeping"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"What with the touch erase. Please fix it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pros: lmage import / Basic shape tool / Non-uniform transform ""Scale & move only"".  Cons: No bucket fill / No layers / No rotate tool.  Version 1.1.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just like paper and a great way to organize notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really excellent! I can only recommend this app, especially in comparison to the Standard S Note app. Way more possibilities to create notes for your purpose!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I recently got introduced to this application. I was a bit skeptical at first saw it as another note taking application but it has really come in handy especially with the PDF writer. Samsung Galaxy note2 downside is having to but add-on that are normally custom with other note taking apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quick, simple n easy to note down important stuff!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have galaxy note 3. This is the app to make a good use of s pen. The best esp with pdf highlighter. Here is the kicker the note page can be as big as you with , excellent for ever expanding handwritten mindmap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just lov it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on samsung note 2014."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The PDF import feature is superb. I wasted my money on numerous PDF readers before finding Papyrus and its premium features. Wholly satisfied. One suggestion, though: it would be very useful if you could open multiple PDFs at once (multi-view). Integration with S-pen multi-window menu would also be useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm and has a scalability for pages that's quite innovative!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note taking app for Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The pdf import feature is pretty costly. It isn't as good as the editing tools within acrobat. There is no continuous page flow so every page is edited separately; the level of zoom on every page needs to be set separately; and when you're done, you need to export the file instead of it just being saved to where it was opened from. In acrobat, there is slightly less flexibility in how you annotate, but none of the irritation. The pdf sync is another premium feature, which did not work on my tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is a great substitute for notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Beautiful results."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"it needs better options to sync with the cloud"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It has a great feature that make it unique app.  Discover it if you used S note a lot. You may upgrade it to get more amazing features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Graph paper. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When attempting to export and share full PDFs that have been highlighted on my Sprint Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Papyrus will sometimes crash. PNGs and JPGs work fine, but PDFs might crash regardless of how many pages are chosen to be exported. Will be 5 stars if this can be fixed in the future, as the rest of the application is simply amazing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good, good, good, good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have this on all my Galaxy Note devices and have yet to find a better app then this one."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is fantastic. I would like a nicer widget though. One that can actually display notes I've written."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Features are just quite perfect for the free version .. Can't wait to try the pro edition ..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This note taking app is perfect for taking handwritten notes, and it exports them to high-quality PDF files with vector graphics.  The addons, though, aren't worth it. For example the text box feature doesn't know what word wrap is, and you can't even see exactly where the text is getting placed. And the PDF importer messes up the PDFs that it imports."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Went to a custom ROM and list my SNote stuff.... It's a good replacement"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Smoothly functioning!!!!☺"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great working app helps my productivity and organization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's got everything I need to replace any physical notebook."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am unable to remove a picture from notes.  Seems silly can add a pic but cannot remove."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"برنامه خیلی جالبیه"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've pretty much done away with physical notepads and notebooks. Started using on my Note I, heavily used with my Note II."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Positives: Writing notes, editing, cutting & pasting elements all work very smoothly & intuitively (apart from a couple a things). Dropbox and synching of pdfs is great & means I have access to pdfs of all my notes on multiple desktops. The folder view has an image of the 1st page, which makes it very easy to find what you are looking for.  Negatives : No way to insert a blank page!! when switching back to the writing/ pen tool, from say the selection tool it brings up the pen options dialog, which has to be dismissed before you can start writing again. Wider cloud support would be good. Changing the behavior of some actions didn't work ; it would be nice if the pen right click allowed you to select objects (ala OneNote). Can't import vector graphic files like eps or svg, so images (in particular plots from say Matlab) don't look great, but is usable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app, i have it on my tablet and use it for school, i just wish there wasa way to zoom in and out so that my notes, since i write big, would not take up so much of a single page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love how easy it is to open and take notes. It's much faster than S note. Improvements: please make sharing files more powerful. I would love to be able to export to a folder of my choosing and use alternative cloud options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the most impressive S-pen writing app in existence, being able to write on pdf documents with NO lag and ease of use, makes Papyrus stand out."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I take a lot of notes and this lets me organize it and keep it all in one place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app for note taking at school on my galaxy note pro 12.2, I have no problems with it and works well with the S-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gives you an experience just like hand writing, with export to a lot of different formats for sharing your notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Requires additional payment for everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Guys you should mention app not working in tab, all I see when I try to write is eraser GUI, no color no writing. Can't record screen or else would have done it. Uninstalled"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than using scraps of paper that I'll only lose!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes! Especially when used with any gladly note device!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for note taking AND PDF markup! Fixed all bugs from previous updates when reported, excellent devs at work here!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really love this app and all that it is capable of doing. However, the inability to add a page to a document between pages is the only thing stopping me from giving this a 5 - star rating. I enjoy doing my homework using this app, but given this proposed flaw forces  me to cram all my work onto one page if I wanted to skip a problem.   Aside from that, this is definitely an app worth using. It is very intuitive and easy to use for those who like to take notes while keeping them organized!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It would be nice if they had a bundle for all pro features to keep down costs for those who want it. Also: evernote integration would be awesome! ... other than that, this is an excellent app for handwritten notes, it has easily replaced samsung's crappy snote for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've purchased all of the add ons, and it still is one of my best value buys. I now use it to operate paperless, and in combination with evernote,  I index the content of annotated PDFs for future reference. Recommended to a friend with a Samsung note, only to be jealous of the addition of active pen support. This app is exactly what tablet computing was designed for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like the flexibility and usefulness of the features. I think that just about every thought I had of something I needed to do with the app was possible. I draw a lot of math problems and send them to people I am helping, and the ease of sending my work really impresses me. I don't have to go through 5 complicated steps that involve opening 3 different applications. I can do it right from the note I am working on and never even leave the note. I don't purchase many apps, but I will definitely purchas"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App in the store for notes. I constantly use it for fair visits to add pictures of the products to my notes. Quick and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'd like to make extra notes to the side of my lecture pdfs. Please make this happen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! I have been using this for two years and it has no issues as of yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for note 10.1!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for taking notes and quick drawings.  I was even able to make some simple scaled diagrams of my garage for designing shelves.  I especially like the export to PDF to various apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the ap. I use it on my 8inch Samsung Note for all my business notes. It would be great if there was a full page widget that allowed it to be opened at all times on a page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the app I've been looking for. Works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The best handwriting app with active stylus out there.  Will give it 5 stars when Google drive and/or Evernote sync are added.  I will pay for it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This developer seems to not support those that have already purchased the premium features. With new updates they release new features but even if you've already purchased them they still charge you. Plus the premium features should be free because they are not anything special. This app needs work to really make it worth while."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's awesome. Esp. after unlocking stroke tool pack, stores handwriting as vector in pdf. No matter how you zoom, the quality doesn't reduce."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a stylus, you should have this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent for Galaxy Note. Finger eraser makes it very handy to use.  Enabling a widget that links directly to a note(not folder) with the note name would be awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A little clunky, but useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Emailed devs.  If every time you lift pen (ie-sign first then middle then last name) ,  the words rotate 90® on the exported off.... Fixed!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The infrequent updates have made this app a must use and a 5 star rating for me"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application for handwritten notes. I had given it 4 stars, but with the addition of PDF notes, it deserves the 5 stars. The only thing I miss is handwriting recognition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"in order for this app to completely take over S-Note, it needs more functions: 1. highlighter 2. more pen options 3. ability to rotate cropped text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for school. Can export a multi-card stack to PDF. Very cool."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Only issue is the very slight lag when writing. However, that said, it is only a minor annoyance and does not really affect tge experience. I still prefer this for notes over the native Samsung app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome application. I take all my math notes now on my tablet because of this app. I hope to take all my math and physics notes on this app as long as I am in school!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best note taking app I've tried yet. I look forward to improvements such as additional shapes (adding shapes is an in app purchase but only rectangles/squares,  ovals/circles and lines are available at the moment) and the ability to wrap text and change the shape of text boxes as only single non - wrapping lines an to be possible currently. A great start!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app won't let me export a note to a PDF anymore. This feature is essential to using Google Cloud Print. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it did nothing, it still won't export as PDF."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app. I purchased all in app items. I hope support for multi-device sync is provided, so that I can view my notes in my phone.   Revision due to extreme slow ""Export to PDFs files"" fix. But I already suffered  a lot due to restricted ability to view my notes, which I needed for preparing the exam. :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app daily and find it to be one of the best in the market. I especially like the layout for the different books and folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wanted an app that offered multiple pages that could be easily added without having to navigate too far from my words. I can write A LOT so it is important that I can keep writing without a lot of interruption or distractions. I also wanted an app that would allow me to create separate journals or notebooks. This fits the bill well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great app, I have e-mailed them, and they have the goal for importing files of different types so you can write on them! It would be like a one note replacement!   UPDATE: New update breaks so much, imported PDFs don't all work properly, exporting to a pdf is now REALLY SLOW, almost unusable. Feel ripped off paying for all these extra plugins that break it.  I can't delete notebooks, auto backup brings the app to a halt when it attempts to back up (forever), and now there are the new bugs introduced with the update.  Another Update: Exporting PDFs is miserably slow. Something happened in the export process and where it used to be snappy is now very slow.  UPDATE: Still can't delete notebooks without it crashing! Exporting PDFs is fixed and is quick. Importing PDFs seems fine now too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I used this app to do my homework. I usually write at 1000% zoom which makes the written portion tiny. There used to be a feature in the select tool to resize the area. This is no longer possible as it now tries to zoom the page view. This app is now worthless to me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If you can add nesting under books for example chapters under books and then sections under -which you create notes   it will make much better organized and useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I needed a note app with the ability to jot down quick notes and save in categories. I do wish you had a better erase function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Totally Userfriendly and Useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Actually bought software for the first time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for taking notes and mind mapping, excellent tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful for classroom notetaking and sharing! I use with a Samsung Note, and I can finally write notes without hanging my hand in the air.  Made for a stylus! Download worksheets on pdf and never use paper again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool to have and easy to use along side with the S Pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really love this app and I use it for my most important business and personal notes and diagrams. I like the unlimited page size as the flexibility allows you to do whatever you want. The app is very lean and not resource intensive. I wish it had a useful search function that would allow me to search the handwritten contents of notes (s-note). Papyrus coupled with s-note is all I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall I like it very much and it's my preferred handwriting app. It's also better than Evernote in terms of writing and erasing speed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fabulous.  The pdf viewer $4.99 extra is THE BEST PAID app  ever.  Love love love it.   Even without the pdf viewer, it is still the best app ever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The interface is elegant and smooth. I haven't really noticed anything too bad about it. I do use it as my main note taking app right only because the competitors aren't as elegant on a Note 3. I think the development of things are slow and they don't build things from scratch for everything so licensing fees go to us for in app purchases of more features. The importing of pdf files came a long time after its competitors. And it's only a basic pdf import where you can't add extra writing space nor add pages"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wanted to eliminate the use of paper and still write longhand notes.  Papyrus on the Samsung note pro has been working great.  In the future I'd like to see some tagging/search capabilities, but it's working well!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If I could give this app 10 stars, I would. I never need a paper again. With my galaxy note I can write school and work notes as easily as a real pen. It has infinite size paper, and I can insert pictures and write on them too. And no, I don't work for them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The backup features do not work as advertised. Lost many valuable notes can't recover lost permantly no answers to my issues. Emailed support with no responses in more then a week. If you need to use this app for work related tasks.  Look elsewhere."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well - can take pages of notes and file them easily for later reference"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really happy with this app  - even after spending $$ the Import PDF and tools feature, I really feel this completes my Galaxy Note 2014 experience.  Much better than S-Note - way more natural a writing experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"good"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Works best with a digital pen; such as the S Pen from Samsung."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a really good app for long handwritten seminar notes etc. Export to pdf is a very handy, but backup to Dropbox needs to allow syncing across devices.  It needs more pen tools including a highlighter & maybe pencil (like the s note has).  For 5 stars, inserting text should be less clunky and easier with wrap at the end of a line(instead of disappearing into infinity) nor require an input box (and have bullet points etc). Also, I really need to delete 20 accidentally created pages, how?"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Papyrus 1.0.3-GP squashes the bug that would sometimes (unpredictably) crash Papyrus when exporting PDFs that I had annotated with handwriting.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"EDIT: Just uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it was an issue with my tab, and not only did it remain unaffected, but I lost all of my notes. IMPORTANT NOTES. Also in the ""Welcome to Papyrus"" tutorial, it SHOWS the option to share, but the option to share is not available. I'm incredibly disappointed. I genuinely enjoyed this program for a month or two, but when it comes to sharing, it not only fell flat, but left me fuming, due to the loss of HOURS worth of notes. I was trying to share them with Evernote in order to avoid the very problem this program just created. ORIGINAL: I've been trying to figure out how to export my notes to evernote, but the option just isn't there. I'm looking at screenshots from an older build and there isn't an option in my version.... There isn't even an upgrade option. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Help would be appreciated"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great functionality in the program. I can create, organize, and distribute my notes among my classmates easily with dropbox functionality and automatic cloud backups.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's good, very good. Better than SNotes and not as complicated as lecture notes. It's smooth and great to look at and use but I have a suggestion.   The eraser needs to be on the main menu as opposed to the color picker. Erasing is used more frequently, color picker is hardly ever used and before you suggest erasing with my finger I would prefer using the tool as that's more deliberate than using my hand which could lead to accidental erasings. I have a note 3 and note 10.1 2014 Edition so using the pen button for the eraser is also a non starter.   Aside from that and maybe reducing the addon prices, I think this is a great app!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Papyrus is a great experience if you're only looking at the free version. I love the two finger scroll and zoom and single finger erase functions - they make note taking so much more streamlined and easy to use! I love how zooming in doesn't fuzz up the writing, which is something I had a serious issue with in LectureNotes. The only problem with Papyrus is that its extra features aren't even that great, and are definitely not worth the price especially when compared to other note taking apps in the market. I also wish there was an audio recording function, because taking notes to a professor speaking is a great tool to have. When other apps in the market have this capability, and at a much lower price than what Papyrus currently offers even without this capability, you know that there needs to be some fixing. I'm definitely regretting purchasing these premium features, and would refund if possible. I love taking plain notes on Papyrus though, and that will keep me using the app for future use."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"One of the great things about supporting paid for mobile apps is you get to see them go from unfinished work and become more refined and useful over time.  What's not great is to see a developer you supported become blatantly greedy and that's what's happening here.  Papyrus is a solid core app that works well, but lacked a lot of features.  If the developer thinks that they're going to keep customers by charging an extra 5 bucks for each feature they can keep wishing.  I'm9 now sadly shopping for a Papyrus replacement and I would reccomend anyone who doesn't like to gets ripped off follows suit."

No note taking app even comes close to this app. I use it primarily for brainstorming projects. Unlike all the other note taking apps Papyrus let's you select portions of your drawings and move them around. An important feature when you realize you missed something between two steps. Also infinite scrolling frees you from the confines of one sheet. Your ideas can grow to the left or down as needed."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The whole point of a pdf import, for me at least, was to be able to markup a pdf already on my tablet, so when my tablet syncs with my office network, the file backs up and replaces the older file in the office network. Importing the pdf creates a new file within Papyrus that has no relation to the original. To actually use the markups, I need to pay even more for the cloud storage, which only syncs with Box and Dropbox (and from what I see in the reviews, that's not working all that well either.) So then I'd have to make the cloud version sync with the office version, and then sync that with my tablet. Way too much file duplication to bother with.   Now, if I could use Papyrus's tools to markup an existing pdf without the need to import it and create a new note, then that would be very nice. Otherwise, it leaves me feeling that the developers were being short sighted, greedy, and selfish, forcing us to pay to use the pdf function, and then forcing us to pay to actually do anything with the documents after Papyrus gets a hold of it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish there was the ability to type notes (it will type short notes) instead of handwriting all the time.  But overall Excellent at its job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app had the potential to be a really great tool for note taking.  However, after purchasing the premium shapes and text addon, I was very surprised at just how basic these 'premium' features were!  The text tool doesn't support wrapping - a bare minimum when you are writing text onto a page.  Text is also entered into a separate edit window instead of directly onto the page.  Shape drawing doesn't even support filled shapes!  The app also doesn't support any form of transparency for items that are drawn.  So you can't use a pen as a highlighter for example.  Lots of things that should improve just to say that it supports basic features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Coupled with a Samsung Note 8, Papyrus has taken over my note writing, from meetings to working as a lab notebook.  Highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Useless.  It doesn't do anything the other pen apps don't do. If anything the built in pen apps (e.g. sketch) are far more functional. I was hoping to at least be able to make simple lists easily with ocr. But they want money for basic features. I might as well use a napkin. Why is this company allowed to regurgitate existing software and try to pass it off as their own brainchild"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is the best note taking app on Android. Originally the only missing feature was PDF annotation. It's not missing any more and it's spectacular.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"does what it says"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Makes good use of the S pen API.  And probably the only app that feels closest to natural writing on paper.  I don't like zoom boxes or zooming in general when I write.  I prefer zoom locking so I have some idea of how large or small my hand writing is.  I love the page size limits so i know when i reach the edge of a page and need to get a new page.  This is a must for making printouts of my notes.  Also I have a tendency to rest my wrist on the device as if it was paper and it doesn't activate other functions like zoom or starts using my wrist to continue writing.  I love this feature the best because I don't need to suspend my wrist and write in this unnatural unergonomic manner.  I don't know  about other people, writing with my wrist suspended causes me physical pain so this is the only usable note taking app I can use without hurting my wrist. I wish an iOS version of this existed and some how had the same ergonomic feature as this. The only drawback is that there is no option to delete pages within the notes.  And other minir features like moving and inserting pages would be nice, but if I could at least delete pages, even as a premium feature I would buy."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No fuss App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A great app, but they should just sell it instead of putting basic things (like keyboard input) for sell.

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Was impressed by this app initially until I saw that in order to get anything over basic features you have to buy each feature separately.  Now for pdf import is another $4.99.    $2.99 for dropbox support; $2.99 to be able to add text or for an eraser ;  And now $4.99 to open a pdf?   A great looking app, but they're being greedy and nickeling and dimeing us to death.   I tried *Lecture Notes* based off of another users suggestion. I can definitely recommend them over this app. Try it. Much better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A good app but a questionnable business model. Why shall I continue to pay for each new features ( as pdf integration ) at the moment ""Lecture notes"" propose advanced features included in the initial price and a remarquable app?"

I have used this app to replace s-note, ezPDF, and sticky notes into one easy to use app.  Only thing that would make this app even better would be if you could create a word document with standard formatting or if there was a page-layout and flip button to create flash cards.  This would then become the only app I use for school.  Overall..... AWESOME APP!!!! :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The one..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For $5 I expect features like ezPdf, not a crappy display I have to zoom every time I change the page (Update: default zoom helps, but it's still difficult; we need cropping etc). I certainly don't expect Dropbox backups to fail! (Update: this was fixed, developer is responsive and quick). Please improve the Pdf feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent for note taking. Works smoothly on my note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I liked the app and purchased the tool pack to support the development. However, considering the last move, I'm going back to Snote (which does PDF import for free): I refuse to support such a greedy nickeling and diming of users... Downrated from A(wesome) to G(reedy)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"But nothing new has come from past update"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"There are 3 premium features, they are all paid separately. Attention! To expensive! It works well, but it could be better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very well functioning note taking program that is a must-have for the Note 3. However it is also very greedy and wants more money for every feature. I have purchased the Premium version and should get additional new features for free. I do no longer recommend this for purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful use all the  time onsite"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app is great! However, the PDF feature is not worth $5 and there isn't a custom margin feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Text editing and composition as a whole is lacking. Can't edit text after leaving the box (EDIT: Use selection tool) Make it similar to S-note text capability, so we can see it on the page as we type.... paid for full version thinking it would improve.  Edit: Thanks for the update (with all due sarcasm). $5 for PDF import? I have already paid for your other premiums features. No app is worth more than $5 IMHO. You are going to lose your edge. Do you respond to reviews?  Also, Dropbox export has become extremely slow as of a few weeks into class. Can you give an option for more frequent backup? Every 2 hours is ideal for me.  12 hours makes it a manual function for me....  Good work, honestly. But I know you all can do better. Prove it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Please fix this issue and will rate 5...samsung s button primary not working"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am concerned that there won't be an end to additional paid features. Why not just give the option for small fee up front and get the updates for free as they're released? That's my only complaint, otherwise this app is miles ahead of S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Note II & a note 10.1. This app is the best for taking notes and accuracy. It also features a highly usable interface and tons of export features. This app works very well with Samsung's pen technology."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Papyrus to take handwritten notes when I'm in a meeting with clients. Afterwards, I export the notes to pdf for sorting and filing together with my typed notes. Papyrus makes this entire workflow very easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very simple and clean app that can be used for notes perfectly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Update 02/24/2014: Without a doubt this is still the best basic note taking app on the market. Previously rated five stars, but removed a star due to new PDF import function being priced at $5. I know the amount is small and I shouldn't question what is the equivalent of a fast food meal, but considering I've already spent more money on this app than I do on 99% of apps the price of this new feature leaves a bad taste in my mouth. At $2-$3 I probably wouldn't have thought twice about the addition. Now I'm uncertain whether I will even purchase it. This situation aside, I still recommend this app over its competitors if you can live without the PDF import functionality. Hope the developer takes this feedback to heart."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow, fantastic, helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Well this app is the best note taking app available at now. But some function should change to the way they should work. Like there is no ""new page"" button. So it's hard to control the number of the paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works brilliantly with the S-pen and my note3, I'm sure it would be even better on the larger 10.1"" or 8"" tabs... I have not used this with finger input alone (with the S-pen, it is setup to have the pen input be the brush and finger input is set to eraser), but I am sure it would be as good. This is better in most cases (imo) than the built in Samsung note taking apps."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I've already invested several purchases into this app. I am extremely unhappy with not getting the pdf import for free when I have already supported the dev. What does papyrus do that lecture notes doesnt do for cheaper? Lecture notes already has folder support...and you want me to pay 4.99? After I've already spent 5 dollars? I will begin looking around at other apps despite my previous satisfaction."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"He'll no! That is way too expensive! Do the average Google play users even pay that much ever?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Update: The newest update of the app finally brings the ability to import PDFs and mark them up as you see fit... as a premium feature in which you have to pay for in order to utilize. This wouldn't be a big deal if it were a similar price to the other two features ($2 at the time I purchased them),  but for so reason,  the developers thought that a feature that comes standard in several other note takings apps was worth their customers paying an additional $5 for it. Papyrus may have the edge when it comes to how well it writes, but it definitely costs a hefty price ($9 if you want all of the features). 2 stars.   Original review: This is a great app overall. Improvements such as the ability to import/edit PDF files would make this leaps and bounds better than other competing note taking applications. Very responsive when writing with a stylus.   Another huge gripe that I have with the existing version of  Papyrus is the lack of S-Pen functionality. Yes,  I know that the developer claims that Samsung has prevented third-party developers from utilizing S-Pen button actions,  but I have seen other third party applications make use of it,  so forgive me if I'm not entirely convinced."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have found the Papyrus app better for my journal writing than the S-note app that comes with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet. Papyrus allows setting the page size to 8.5x11. With the tablet in landscape orientation, the 8.5"" width of the screen means I can write in the same scale as on standard paper with a traditional pen. The app also provides a greater range of pen line widths, has better pressure sensitivity, and it's a vector program that exports a much sharper page to PDF than the S-note's jpeg-based export. Print-outs look very much like my old hand-written pages. Also, Papyrus PDF pages can be opened in Adobe Illustrator for more advanced editing of the vector-based lines if desired."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus may not be as feature rich as the S Note app version that originally shipped with my Note 2 and Note 10.1 2012 but...and apologies for the Samsung rant...  Since my Note 2 updated to Android 4.3, the new version of S Note (with less features, and new file format I can't use on my Note 10.1 2012), and the Samsung cloud features which no longer reliably support the inter device syncing I rely on are corrupting my note files (feels like a cynical move by Samsung to force me to buy new hardware or maybe just a really really badly planned rollout). I therefore decided to look for an alternative that didn't tie me to Samsung software or a never materialising Android upgrade for my Note 10.1 2012 (love their hardware but can't trust their abilities to reliably provide compatible software for a tablet I have only owned for 9 months)  Papyrus is absolutely that alternative. The pen tracking is way better than S Note. S Note always was a tiny bit off. What appeared on the screen was never exactly aligned with the S Pen nib. With Papyrus it is so spot on and faster too. When combined with the exceptional pressure sensing using Papyrus is like writing with pencil and paper. Superb."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I'd like to give this 5 stars as I really do use Papyrus a lot (much better than SNote in many ways!).  However, it's mainly let down by not having the ability to delete unwanted pages and not being able to rearrange the pages of a document. I feel this is an essential feature of programs like this. Otherwise, keep up the good work! :)"

Here are some features I would like to see to make this a better app:  The response is slow relative to my ability to write.  This also has the side effect of making the written letters look smaller than the hand motion would have dictated.  Doesn't allow typing in the non-premium version.  Screen does not auto adjust as you move to the edge while writing.  You have to stop what you are doing and manually scroll the page.  There is no highlighter.  Page settings are limited -- no background color change??  No search or OCR support.  I have to zoom the entire page to make a space large enough to write on (Can't write very small with a stylus.) .  So I can only see a tiny bit of my page while I'm writing.    Given the limitations. particularly in the pen response, I'm not motivated to buy the premium version."

However, that said, here are a few things missing in this app that are available in S-Note: 1. Ability to highlight 2. Ability to move page order around"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does what is says it will. Works well on my Asus tf101 tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app on the note 2. Greater functionality than s note and a much better ui."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you Papyrus for this app. I study Economics and Mathematics and  for a long time I was looking for a good way to turn my galaxy tab 10.1 into a notebook and now i found that good way!  If the good people of Papyrus will take the next into consideration the app will earn a perfect 5: 1. In addition for the manual zoom maybe add a feature that lets you define to view modes that you can slide through without the pinch. 2. Maybe creat Ink to Math, i mean write an equation and then it will be translated into a printed form. 3. let the toolbar be custom organized (i mean as an option), so while i am writing during a class it will be easier for me to brows through the tools. 4. sub-Notes - I can creat a notebook but i cant creat sub-notebookes\ tabs inside the note booke.  thank you for your time and i recommend this app for everybody!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Must have for users with active pens, and such useful updates in short periods of time I get excited with what they have to offer next! You can tell this new developer has a bright future. Keep up the good work!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What makes it better than S Note for me is I can use it exactly like a real notepad and pen.  For some reason I have a difficult time using the s note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"convenient for taking notes/ I Like using It during public discourses"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, now use it in all my meetings. There are a few improvements that can be made"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is almost perfect, but the only thing I can think of that it needs is a page size that does not require zooming out to fit. Basically, if there was a page size that was set to the screen (like S Note), I would be perfectly happy. Other than that, this app works very well for everything I've thrown at it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The premium services are key. I use this for note taking in class and it works wonderfully. It would be nice to have an option to disable the buttons so my wrist doesn't accidentally exit the note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So many uses, well designed, simple. Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I dont like the app. The writing seems horrible, cant even read myself. Not accurate, the pointer seems too sensitive. Didnt work for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's fantastic, but I could be better if it asked for save before exit and not autosave."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Some extra features are required, like page control, page number showing total number of pages, one click for changing from pen to earaser"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app..very useful.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Problems:  1) Moving and resizing gets mixed, it is too hard to move selection because the app always decides to do the resizing.  2) Howering on the page border should scroll.   This app is what S Note should be. Great job guys! And I'm happy to pay for premium features if it ensures that the app will stick around and keeps getting better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app use it for note taking at university and its perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time, both at work and outside. Makes the s-pen useful with natural note taking. Easy export to pdf and dropbox sync!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As a beta tester since the s-pen dev contest I'm disappointed by the multiple purchases model. It's severely limited without both so you might as well make it one & lower it a little"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent papy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The basic app is rock solid, unfortunately the additional packs are wanting.  The dev team is equally lacking in responding; their top planned feature is a year and a half old and they don't respond to emails."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best features but choppy rendering"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A good replacement for SNote."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just compare . you will know it's great app we are using."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app has brought my Galaxy Note 8.0 to the next level. I've been using it in class to take notes. It has allowed to go totally paperless. All it needs is some notebook organization. Folders to group notebooks, or divisions of notebooks (like a 5 subject notebook). Either way I need something to group notebooks by semester."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like its simplicity"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just what I needed! Perfect utilization of the S Pen. The creator of this app deserves flowers.  *edit 1/8/13 I purchased the extra tools feature. I took one star down because of the Text Tool. Contrary to my expectations, text CANNOT be resized using the selection tool and text CANNOT be erased with both the original eraser and the ""real"" eraser. Text has to be selected with the selection tool AND THEN deleted."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"very useful,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I forget my paper notebooks a lot but always have my tablet. This app allows me to write notes and then I can transcribe it later when I get home. And it's fun to draw with!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for a year now and love it. No problems at all. I find I use it almost every day for various things. Highly recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In my eyes the best note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,":)))"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! I especially like the infinity note option. I use papyrus on an almost daily bases and this app has finally substituted my paper notes and to do lists. I had all kinds of apps on my laptop, smartphone and iPad for notes and to do lists but never found them convenient enough and always switched back to paper forms until Papyrus came long. I have upgraded some options for back up but the free version works great as a standalone version too. (I can recommend the back up option though). P.S.: using it on a SG Note 3."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It doesn't do handwriting recognition butit does accurately portrait your writing and means I no longer have to carry around masses of notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"NEEDS an input window. I would be willing to pay for an app that rivals iPad's GoodNotes..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well with the active stylus on the Galaxy Note 8.0"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using this on my GT-N7105 (Note 2) with S Pen. Works great. Intuitive controls for ""active pens"" like the s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great & easy to use app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I run a note 2. This may be my most used app. Has never let me down."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The free version is ok and works well, but do not spend the 3 bucks for the tool package. The ability to add text is not a benefit the way this works. Text entry is done via the Samsung yellow area which is fine, but it goes to a little white Preview box until you hit ok. Once you hit ok you will find that the text you entered is in one Continuous line regardless of how you setup your page. You then have to go back to enter return characters which is a hassel, and becomes not possible to edit because you cannot select the entre text line with the Lasso tool. Free APP is good, but the paid part is not worth the 3 bucks. If I could get a refund I'd surely ask for one. If I could I'd give the free App 4 stars, but since I can only give one rating I'm rating what I paid for - big disappointment."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great app for making the tablet feel as natural as a notebook, however this is nothing more than a drawing pad if there is no handwriting recognition that would turn writing to typed text. l could give the app 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"'nuff said"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"App stopped and galaxy note pen did not work when settings changed. Unistalled app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very, very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome product!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good for engineering note tool. It's almost a 5 stars. I wished it could import pictures for back ground drawing and making notation. Switching from a drawing tools and eraser is not simple. Page sizing is difficult on my Samsung note 3. Must be up graded to paid version to be usable. Cost for the up grade can be lower."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Found a simple note taker like the much missed Snote. Shame to have to choose pen or finger, why not both?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I hope to use this soon.   I played with it extensively today.   One thing I'd like to see improved is dragging selections.  It's hard to grab thinner strokes/objects.  It'd be great to have the traditional drag icon on the corner of the object to easily click and drag the selection.  It'd also be great to change background color for use in darker rooms."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works just great with Galaxy note S-Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Sync is great, which makes this app stand above the other note taking apps I've tried. Perhaps nit the most intuitive interface, but it's simple.  More s-pen options would be nice. Great app!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple app with only the features that I need, and the features that it has are very well refined, and smooth to use. I have note books with lots   of info and sketches for work and I use it all of the time on my Note 10.1 along side documents, web pages and the calculator to take notes and figure things out. The most used productivity app that I have"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pls make the words more realistic when we write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use, infinite paper length, notebook organization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give 5 stars but I miss couple of functionalities: 1. multiple brush type (not necessary a must though) and 2. Page reorder, insert, deletes etc. Can be done with text copy but is cumbersome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"From my training notes to meetings to grocery lists... papyrus is my companion now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"must have app for any samsung note series owners, its a brilliant app, awesome when used with dual view"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"need to take notes with a pen like on my note 2 phone and this does not do it could not even enter text from keyboard avoid"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I prefer this note taking app to the samsung s note that my tablet comes with, but the inability to insert/delete a page is a total showstopper, and means I can't use it. I'm a mathematician, and want to use this for my work, and also, for presentations. This standard feature appears to be planned, and I'm hoping it will be included soon."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It gives me the sensation of working on a unlimited sheet!! It is very helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty rad and cool :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really batter than SNtoe"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Much better than the notes app that came with the tab."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"a respectable note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good for taking notes, doodling, drawing, and brainstorming. There is a slight lag in the ink - noticeable when compared to an app like Paper on iPad - but the tool is quite usable. Cloud integration is great: I'm backed up."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Supports syncing to cloud, allows categorization of notes and is way faster than samsung's S Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Being that I have not opted for the premium services yet, I'm giving this application a 5 because my I can overlook a couple things I would have liked to have seen.  I like that the application is simple, runs fairly well, and takes up relatively little space.  The backgrounds are classic and not overdone at all; it is very practical (a major plus) being that it is quite reminiscent of writing on actual paper.  It is perfect for anyone who only wants a notepad!  There are only a couple things I would have liked to have seen, though of course, not at all critical:  *Logarithmic paper (just in case). *Something (perhaps at the main page) that tells me the total pages that have writing or are being used by each note. *A way to insert a page between pages. *An option to list each note/notebook as a list instead of tiles so that it may be easier to navigate a large number of them.  Overall, the app is very functional and I use it all the time for just about everything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app for taking notes in class. Is there a feature that will change handwriting to text? I like having that feature and its a pain going between this and s note or to add text. Love the app its fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs mor brush sizes please.. need big brushes not small, small size is enough, just give us a manual option to change brush size as I like to paint the whole canvas with one color,and it takes long time to cover whole canvas with max size of brush,so increase the maximum size of brush."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I will give 5 stars once you allow black background . This will make it perfect regarding evidenced base benifit of bLack color background, add to that saving battery life span. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Smooth writing, objects can be moved around easily. Lacks page management however, which is a must-have feature for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I use Snote because it has a home screen widget I can keep notes and lists of things on.  Papyrus is much more functional and had a better feel, however I don't use it because it lacks that widget I use nearly every day.  I keep it installed on my device in the hopes one day an update will come that will grant my wish.  However it's been over a year of waiting..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice app if used wd a S pen Dan! I have been using this app since last 3 months without any trouble. I can note down my notes here and can easily draw any rough sketch of a building plan or etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The text typing tool is totally useless, you definitely should have let me try that feature before purchasing. The text needs to be editable and typed onto a page, not into a text box. I want my money back.. :("
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"much better than  Samsung's S Note and integrates nicely with multi window feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It allows bigger pages for your note taking than the default Samsung apps.  Not bad but the Note 3 version of S-Note is still more featured. It could really use tool tips when hovering with the S-Pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I understand wanting to charge for the cloud storage option but there really needs to be more support than just Dropbox and Box. Skydrive support would make it worth the $3 for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really helpful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For everyone using their tablet for notetaking, this is THE app for it. Even better for all the devices equipped with styli."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Must have apps for Galaxy Note 2 if you don't have a stock ROM. This app takes the place of the s note app, just set it to pop up when you do a double tap with your pen"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I won't spoil it with words, this thing is just flawless"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like taking notes with this app. Infinite paper size really beats s-note. Erasing with finger is cool.   But i have problem managing pages as it lacks insert, delete or rearrange page.   I also found sometimes i accidentally erase some contents when i scroll page. It would be great if there is a small circle showing up when finger eraser is activated, so i would notice that i am erasing something.    Please add this feature in the next version."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note app on the play store. I can't say anything more.  Anyone using a stylus will use it regularly."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best handwritten note taker available"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The lag between my pen strokes and the visual representation on my Note II is to much.  The zoom in and out feature is not calibrated to a fixed location.  If I zoom out from a fixed point on the side of the page the app zooms back in to the center of the viewing area instead of the original location.  When zooming in to the new location I cannot scroll in any direction.  This app is still Beta IMHO.  I look forward to the updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not my perfect app but best I have come across"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is excellent for note taking with an active stylus, there's more than enough customization options and the additional tool pack is very useful.  BUT my only gripe is that you cannot have the selection\colour etc tools being visible on their own in the toolbar. There's clearly a lot of empty space there to make these tools visible separately, saving you time from additional taps when you constantly have to switch between them. It'd be very useful.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app   I really appreciate how polished it is. Def my first choice in active pen apps!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only one word to describe it - GREAT !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful now taking app with good interface. Its slightly slow updating canvas when you want to write much faster sometimes misses some small Stokes but I am completely happy with it. The only thing I wish for is a auto smoothing curve feature for broken polygon shaped curves appears when my handwriting size is small."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best pin note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a good not taking app that I use several times a week at work. There are a few annoyances, like having to exit edit mode to perform an ""undo"" for an edit you just made, and the text box feature could really use an auto-wrap so your text doesn't run off the page in one long line."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Needs a more up - to date interface..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Makes me study more"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"thanks for a great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is an amazing notetaking app. Instant erase and undo/redo with one touch. You can transition from pen to finger to erase in a split second. Almost all other note apps require a tool change for this function. I can't even begin to describe how much faster this makes Papyrus compared to everything else.   The page layouts are minimalist and simple. Controls are intuitive and sparse. This is a notetaking app. We don't need all that extra BS. You can either see an overview at a glance, or scroll through the pages one at a time. The interface is blazingly fast to navigate! The notes simply save when you move to another page or quit. No time wasting prompts, no hand holding       My only complaint is that the pen isn't as responsive and quick as the Autodesk Sketchbook App. It may have something to do with these types of apps vectorizing the writing, rather than the raster ouput in Sketchbook.    Otherwise, this is easily the greatest note-taking app available for Android."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Struggles to keep up on the samsung p3100"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app with Galaxy note 8.  It's works great.  I like using my finger for erasing, and like this vector drawing.  This is so much better than the crappy snote.  Hope they implement equation recognition similar to onenote.  I would pay for that option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Definitely worth the $3 to upgrade the tool pack. Almost like writing on actual paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Easy to learn and use. I have one suggestion. Can you add a feature to make a picture you have taken the actual sheet to write on? For example, if You get handed a document and take a picture of the document and you want this stored in your notebook, can that picture be the entire page instead of just a piece of the notebook paper? A way to store handouts for writing on is basically what im asking for"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"There are periodic lag spikes when writing (Galaxy Note 2), but overall performance and use ability is good. Only major problem seems to be the inability to export to the device. All export options are to online sources as .PDF, .PNG, and .JPEG. However, if I want to export to my SD card as any of these file types, I am unable to do so. Also, both image formats are much lower in quality. Other than the issues with exporting notes, I love the app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Two problems:  I can't properly dot my i's, make periods, etc. I always zoom in to 500% to write my notes (so I can zoom out and have a nice overview), so maybe it was meant to prevent stray marks. Nevertheless, it gets kind of annoying.  Also, it needs some sort of save function. Sometimes I'll be taking notes and the app will crash. I don't know about the next guy, but my Physics prof isn't the best and rewriting the extensive notes I've taken to understand what is going on is a huge pain for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I upgraded to the note 3 with Jellybean from note 1. S note dos not work as well as previous os and Evernote did not allow for S pen note taking.  So, Papyrus works better with the S Pen.  Glad I found it.   Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly. I use it to take notes in class instead of pen and paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It perfectly replaces the samsung galaxy note original software. It could have more options of pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"yes could write clearly with stylus or with finger.. fast and lag free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and closely resemble paper and pen, with my finger as eraser!  I only wish my phone is bigger!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"An excellent app for handwriting notes on my wacom hybrid tablet!  Free of charge too for most features, 5 stars!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it's simplicity, I use it more than the S Note that comes on my Galaxy Note 3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for the S-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"As stated above, writing with Papyrus on the Note 3 isn't the best experience. The lines are choppy. I'll stick to S-Note for now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app keep the updates Coming."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"For me, the best serious note taking app to date. When I want to work, I always come back to it. Minors glitches but so nice!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love it, have tried many notespads on my Note and this is nearly as good as it gets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking I found so far for my Samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014. One thing that would make this even better would be the ability to paste images from the clipboard. Thanks so much for this wonderful app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app.  Very easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Liked the app so I purchased the up grade. On the Note 2 its worthless for text. way to Small of Fronts and Editing text is very hard. would Not up grade. stick with free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful simple no fuss app. It works."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is just what I've been Looking for,  and it works great.   The one feature I wish it had, is encryption for notes. I'd like to use this for journaling, but I need to ensure privacy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Love the Dropbox integration"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and organize my notes for work, Studying, and journaling. Just what I was looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Deduction of points for not locking on 100% zoom. By that I mean, if you zoom towards 100% it should be easier to stop at exactly 100%. 100% is good. 100%"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with my job needs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No Bullshit."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just perfect!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most generic tablet can use this app. You can use your finger as stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use my SPen a lot because of this app, actually. That's honestly the truth"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's so easy to use and nice for bigger-screened phones/tablets. Today, I lost my voice and used this app to scribble down all my words. (And add some doodles as well.) I LOVE the selection tool!  Hands down will use this app for a long time! The design and user interface are very nice & simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use snd and fast!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In fact this app comes in the 5 Top most Spen apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The stroke recognition is very spotty.  I put down my stylus and start writing in cursive and it gets about 75% of what I put down.  It is not really terrible, it just makes taking notes a chore, because you have to go slowly and carefully.  So, I am still looking for good handwriting recognition that I can try out for free.  I am willing to pay for something that works, but not without a chance to try it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Loving it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice note taker which is why I got this app, but surprisingly it also turned out to be a good doodling app. Different colors and sizes, with beautifull graphics due to vector graphics. Only has 1 star minused because it does not have different types of brushes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Blows away s note ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would never recommend using only an app for note taking except maybe this one!	Great note taking app (New Google Nexus 7) love it, works with no lag for me. My only complaint is that I wish it was easier to move text and images around, if they fix that tiny issue it is a 5 star app. Premium features are not necessary but are just an added bonus. Works great for my English and Calc classes. Also great for reviewing for tests because I can always have my notes with me. Definitely consider this app for note taking! One of the best on the market."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can we get a widget of a selected note ? Like snote offers ?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program especially with the paid add ins. I would like to see a user definable pop up menu in a lower corner like Quill has so I don't have to go to the top of screen for my frequently used options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the best software out there, however the paid features are annoying and should be free. but we all got to make money!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall an awesome note taking app, especially for the note 10.1 2014 edition. It would be nice to be able to annotate pdf files, maybe add an equation solver, and Google drive integration...right now box and Dropbox integration is available as a premium feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just love it, its like taking notes with real pen and paper using my Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple interface does everything it needs to.  The vector based approach is where it's at.  Export as pdf, load the file in Adobe Illustrator, and you can edit the strokes like any other Illustrator file.  Very handy! Thank you for S-Pen support WITH eraser. Best app for Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for nook hd+"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its awesome, but i wish i didnt have to pay for the rest of the features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"And it has fine pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best on android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very easy and pleasant to use,  especially with a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This program has really helped me take notes for college engineering coursework. Having an infinite canvas to work with helps me capture ideas for classes that require more paper than s note has the ability to offer. If u dont have the upgrades purchased then you're missing out!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app. I use it for all my notes I just wish they had larger fonts for the text boxes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My S2 has got the update and now this app works. Thanks alot developers. 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well, can use some additional shapes and export capabilites but still very impressive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"works great, lots of useful Settings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent at organizing thoughts. Truly viable way to go paperless. It's what the snote software should have been. By far the most useful app in my arsenal.  If you have a stylus, this is the app for you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works for Me!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great tool, I use it for school and it performs great. I would like to see different formats rather than just the open endless white page. But otherwise a must have with the s-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with my note 3, much better than the pre loaded writing aps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is easy to use and wonderful. I used it continually .I recommend it for others therefore I wish  to  be completed free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Infinite page size and easy resizing of notes is great, but would really like to see options for paper color and texture. Stark white gets hard on the eyes. Also a direct link to Evernote would be nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is easy to write something without the keyboard! A true note for tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"user-friendly . recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just love it. Would definitely be getting the pro version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No problems yet. Wish it would automatically pull up keyboard when I want to name a note, save a button press. Isn't a problem but just a bit of constructive feedback."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple presentation. Very good for instant note taking. Much more instant than Samsung's note app. For me handwriting with Samsung's  excellent note stylus is faster even than Swype. I wish the pressure facility worked better. I coughed up a fee for the extras to get text input. Suggestions for improvements would be OCR, but not at the expense of speed and a dictionary on the text input. Galaxy note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, but what about Google Drive synchronisation?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very well designed, useful features, and free. One thing, it really needs palm rejection. If they could implement this I would be super excited. Best Android competitor to Penultimate."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This application deserves 5stars for the vector drawing capability alone...  Infinite page size is a huge plus too.  However some features are mandatory on a stable version: possibility to delete unnecessary pages of a note, view them on a thumbnail format  and sort them by drag and drop, set default zoom to ""fit window"" upon opening, and finally, text font is too tiny even using the biggest value"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like all the features and the addition of an spen support just great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"And just the job. Very Smooth and responsive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I found it better than any other free note taking app It needs some improvements like more pages layouts and it will be better if i can arrange files in thumbnails, list , list with derails, orsmaller icons Thank you for tgis nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect , I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Truly simple interface. Works well on S3 as well as my Nook. Works great with a simple stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best for class notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Been using for a few weeks now, works well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Makes me want to get a note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my HTC Flyer and Samsung Note 3. I love the cloud back-up/restore functionality. The developer even added a few of my feature requests. Well worth paying for premium features!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is a pleasure to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It works, and I appreciate the copy-paste mechanic, but without an Active Pen, this is quite... lame, really."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great to have an s-note equivalent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love it, great app for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can resize, move, change color of text. Also can draw picture. Very good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"i cant access the pen tool...it simply open thats it... cant access not even the single tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this with the S-Pen on a Galaxy Note 10.1, and the integration with the S-Pen is excellent. The ability to export to Evernote is very useful, although it only allows you to export as a new note (and not append or edit an existing one.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very simple and easy note taking tool. The only thing I would like to add is password protection and encryption."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very well designed and easy to use. Very accurate and quick. Well worth the price for the two add-ons. Thanks Papyrus for making me more productive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app and bought the additional tools. Changed my Galaxy Note 10.1 to a 10.1 2014 version and it lagged annoyingly. KUDO'S for the developer. Solved it in no time. The best and most easiest note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app, itself, is okay, but the terms of use is an immediate turn-off. While it doesn't presume royalty-free rights to your content, which would have instantly earned it a one star, it does require that the app be used for personal, non-commercial endeavors. So if I wanted to draw sketches for a commercial comic or take notes for a novel I aim to sell, I couldn't do it with this app. If just taking school notes, this app is fine, I suppose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app, almost perfect. I use it with both s-pen and n-trig. The one enhancement I'd suggest is the ability to scroll. When performing complicated calculations, you need to see the end of the previous page. Thank you."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent and useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"First of all, this is an excellent app for taking notes.  I'm using this in meetings at work and it works perfectly.  The inking is excellent.  You have the ability to sync with Dropbox...albeit for a cost (which is reasonable), however holding off on five-stars until there is direct Evernote syncing (similar to S-Note).  Really looking forward to seeing this develop further.  This is my go to note taking app currently.  You should consider this as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The only thing i like is the erase by finger.  Other than that, the app cannot compare with Samsung SNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In you uses The  galaxia note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A suggestion for the next version: it would be nice if you could insert tables/graphs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I bought the premium features for this as the note taking ability was so good, but unfortunately this quality doesn't reflect in the cloud services add-on, this only allows periodic backup and not full synchronisation as I want to have my notes synchronised between my Note II phone and Note 10.1 tablet. I can't even restore the database created on one device onto the other, which renders this add-on pretty much useless.  Get a proper sync function enabled and this would be a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is so much better than the default SNote application. Infinite page size, zoom, tools, and the very same SPen compatibility."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is all I've been looking for, it does everything i want but two things. First you need to use two finger to scroll down and that (if using style like me) is a little uncomfortable to switch between one and the other. Second (suggesting) you should add a feature that let you change the paper style; instead of just line paper.   I really like this app, i will tell everyone about it!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Paparus - easy to use, handy application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"More responsive and flexible than S Note for handwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app, I am tempted to support the developers to buy this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs an import pdf feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app, do all my school work on it. So many abilities its great. Recommended"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If can do like syning the record voice and handwriting willbe 5. Also if better with handwriting support on pdf will be better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Overall good note taking app, I use it to take notes in school in each of my classes. l am in the sciences, so being able to write everything out is very useful for diagrams and illustrations. However, this app could use more tools to improve functionality. For example, a fill tool would be nice, as well as the ability to correct shapes into proper proportions like some othernote taking apps. l also purchased the upgraded tools pack, but all it allows you to do is draw a straight line , rectangle or circle. More features included in this pack would definitely improve my rating. live also recently had an issue inserting images into my notes lately. The app has been crashing when I try to add images, however, this is something that can be patched, so I haven't deducted any points for my review. I would rate this app 7/10 until more Features are added. (Dev Hint : have a look at iOs's Notability and borrow a few features)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"however I wish there was a better widget instead of just an icon for a blank page. I Still use it over everything else."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for taking notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really nice app.  Simpler version of a notepad compared to s note.  Finally I don't waste 30 seconds when I want to create a note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Simply doesn't work on my Android tablet - doesn't recognise any inputs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed and the price is right!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much. I use it on my note 2 for every class. It's so easy to export documents to Dropbox and print them out later. Please work with Samsung to get the s-pen side button features working. That's the only issue but it works perfectly fine without the special side button functionality. Thanks for the great app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Note 2 shines with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use it regularly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"galaxy Note 10.1 about half a second lag Update: Developer fixed the lag problem, will rate 5 and probably pay if Samsung clipboard is incorporated."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Most used app i have! Ryan Rudzik"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Looks pretty good, any chance we can add in subfolders and passwords?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Like it for my drawing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly with thr tablet after the update!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for galaxy note series!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Please add colors for background. S Notes like Backgrounds plus black  would be great, custom color would be ok. Update: still no background colors"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app .it is a must have"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Scrolls to the right and down ti keep notes on one page. Finger erasing saves so much time. Super responsive with the S Pen. Love this app!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly and fast app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Waaaay better than snote on galaxy note 10.1. Love how I can infinitely stretch the paper, which is sometimes critical when taking notes or drawing a diagram in class"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for note taking sans s pen...love it totally"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this bc it says it works with the s pen but holding the side button and flicking doesn't do anything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple, fast, free. Perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's simple, with very clean UI and much faster than S Note.  I love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice to see devs taking such an interest and making good products"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I really like this application but the only thing missing for me is a tweek up in one tool. That is the shape maker. I would love it to have auto detection. Something like S-note. That would help us make shapes like semicircles or 3D shapes like cubes. Other than that it's an amazing application. The price for the cloud feature is useless though. Because we arnt even using up their cloud. We have to log in to box or toolbox so I think they shouldn't charge Us for this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than s memo Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fixed lag issue. Thanks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a pretty cool app but lags a little bit when writing on the nexus 7 2. When you write the ink starts to slow down and lags behind your finger"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this every day now. I find it less fiddly than the note apps that come with the Note 10.1. Once click and I'm in Papyrus. Another and I have a blank page ready to jot on for a meeting or note taking. I recommend the cloud plugin for about €2. It backs your notes up to Dropbox automatically. It means that if my Note gets lost or broken all the notes I've created are safe in PDF format.  Is a killer app. When I show colleagues the PDFs of notes in my dropbox they're a bit jealous with their idevices :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried to reinstall three times but the issue prevails. There is immense lag whenever I try to write within the app. Regular menu response is fine. I am assuming this is an issue with the note 10.1 2014 Edition alone, considering it is fresh off the shelves. I am hoping for a quick fix as I intended for this tablet to be used for school primarily and this is the best handwriting app I have found. It worked well on my Note 2.   Edit (10/30/13): The issue has been fixed, quite earlier than I expected it to be! Great job dev(s)! Bumping to a deserved 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the note 2014 fix!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just got the galaxy note 10.1 2014. The lag is crazy. Until that is fixed I'll be with s note  Edit: great app now after update"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Nice and quick handwritten notes. Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday at work and at home.  Very helpful and simple to use but completely functional as a replacement for traditional notebooks and pens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used several apps for taking notes, nothing comes close to the clean simple design and flexibility of papyrus. I love the ability to zoom and pan across the page. Totally addicted to papyrus on my Samsung Note II and Samsung Note 8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got the basic version without any IAP. It serves me better than lecture notes, S-notes, Quill or anything else."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"what would have been otherwise a great app is now an utter disappointment ! I purchased the text tool kit to realise that it only enables entering text and its size. There is noTEXT STYLING option!  I Demand My MONEY Back from the Developers!!!  Other Drawbacks: -No import options (from other files) - No Background of paper design option - No easy shortcut for adding a page - No layout sitting for the whole note, You have to make charges page by page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent Excellent!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If I add image I can remove it or edit later  Also each page have separate page setting.  If I can made first paid setting as default for new page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome! And all I used was a fingertip. Great job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am impressed so far.  I still wish passive stylus writing was better on the Nexus 7 but Papyrus is very good and way ahead of the competition.  The UI is very friendly to use as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very cool app, I use it for writing cooking recipes, shopping lists and all kinds of notes. The only thing missing here is google drive backup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great way to record notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a really useful app. Its nice I can use mu s pen with it. Its super easy to use. Very straight forward."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 almost since I first bought it. It has great responsiveness and pressure sensitivity with the stylus, it has some of the versatility that comes with any vector art software, and the developers have continued to improve it. Perfect for paper-free sketching, doodling and note-taking while relaxing or on the go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"useful for note-taking and drawing diagrams. features i found useful: -select, move, and resize function for moving portions of a drawing around -unlimited continuous page space, useful for diagrams that get bigger than expected -erase function with finger is separate from write with stylus (S pen in my case): no need to switch modes back and forth just to erase -color palette -insert pictures or images into your notes: way easier than redrawing or copying over"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great job, keep it up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"simply awesome for note taking on the galaxy note.  couldn't be happier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Rofy7"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous that I have to pay to type on my note. It's such a basic function"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quite good and intuitive to use.  Having a good stylus is imperative. 5 stars if can get Fu Inger sensitivity as good as a quality stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love that you can scroll the page but app needs audio recording ability with audio associated with the note.  That would be great for lectures ala microsoft word notes taking and samsung s note software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If you want a great app for journaling,  this is unbeatable! When I need advanced features (I, e. highlighting, book marks,  etc) for class notes, Write is better. But for the clean,  sophisticated UI and smooth, high quality text that looks like your own handwriting, this is tops!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Very very productive. I wish it had a feature to delete a page just like s-note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not smooth at all.  Big time lag with S Pen. I regret paying $5.98 for the additional features (Shapes+Cloud services).  I would give it ""zero"" star if I could.  I want a refund!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've pretty much replaced S-Note with this as I find it to be so much cleaner and more intuitive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice and simple to use. I gave Four stars because  It is missing Features like highlighter , ability to add tables like we can in S Note. Although This App will help me go For Cynagonemod, so I won't miss my s pen Features, but more features Certainly needed to make this app 5 star."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app,  but the lack of a ""fit page"" zoom level default is really starting to bug me.  Please add that!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking app in Google Play Store, period. It's an equivalent to Apple Store's Notability, which i think is very simplistic and good for fast and easy usage in lessons for example."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it for school.  Very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for taking notes in my college math and EE classes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great i love it its what ive been looking for in a note app. If you have an s pen and want to get stuff done this is the app for you!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love using this app on my note 8. However, it currently have a significant delay when writing on the latest galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition. Hope to see update fix for it soon!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works amazing with the GNII."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It would be nice if you add more features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Without a doubt the simplest and easiest program for writing on a tablet.  Super easy to use and great organization"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The way a notepad should work.  Plus love the dropbox backup."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended to anyone who has a stylus pen. Better than paper!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Terrible lag on new galaxy note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb . excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got this app mainly because the S-note software that comes with the galaxy note 2 couldn't do different size and color pens. I mainly use the app to write short reminders or doodle ideas and it works perfectly. I also like the organization scheme much better than that of the s-note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is the primary app for my note taking. I would love to see it including tags used in GTD."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It is a good note APP nothing greate woks ok but odd page size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Limited only by the inability to not use full screen and eliminate the everoften accidental hit of the task bar"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app,  but there's always room for improvement. Being able to switch between write and erase more easily would be a nice improvement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only reason i am not rating 5 star is, for file size of 17 pages when exported as pdf it is using 2 MB which looks like too much. I need to further dig down to say is it something which adobe has to work papyrus team. Any way this application making my life easy and making my purchase of galaxy note phone worth"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent product"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the hand writing ability w the s pen and that when I set my hand on the screen as I'm writing it doesn't make unwanted marks. Great for lists and things of that nature!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this every day"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for quick note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you write on your tablet, this is the best app out there for you"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The Best writer for the note! Best resolution and Most responsive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I use this app for class for its ease to take picture of slkides and draw notes on top. I enjoy backing up my documents on my cloud storage and using text.  But since I paid for all these features its annoying that most recently the take picture feature is not working at all. I can take pictures just fine, and I click the check mark to confirm that I want to use the picture and when its jumps to the app it says ""unable to add image"".  Having this happen unexpected in class I lost the ability to record several slides and had to refer to a friend after class (don't have much time in between them!)  Please fix this feature as I paid for your features but its all useless if certain features don't work. If this is fixed in an update I will 5 star"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I purchased text tools, but when I try to insert long texts, it does not automatically resize the text box so that it can fit in the page. For example, if you type long sentences, it will be out of screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please update for galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition.   5 stars when updated.	I've been using this app for the past few years with my original note 10.1. Would love to continue to use it but it is very laggy on the galaxy note 10.1 2014 Edition. Thank you"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note takimg app by far. ! Much better than samsung default note app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for note taking. Use it everyday"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Needs some extra features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for SPen use. Deserves six stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I especially really love how I can immediately move and resize drawings of I accidentally run out of space, which you can't do in the snote. However I would like it if it had multiple pen type options such as the pencil. The pencil on the snote resembles my handwriting the best and looks so much neater than the regular pen function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Hope they fix"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"While I used S-Note a lot when I came across this app I was blown away. Love the ease of use and erasing mistakes is easy! Just touch the line.  Try it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good one  the best among the available apps in Google play"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I'm trying out this app on the new Note 10.1 2014 Edition. It's very slow compared to the s-note application.  My writing takes a sec to show up on the screen. Is it suppose to be like this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is a great simple app for note taking. It would be better if theres a dedicated zoomed input space, and an adjustable palm rejection zone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love It! I always use it for school or other meetings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wonderful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great replacement note taking app for the galaxy note 2."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it every day in school for notes and I love how I can export it as a pdf for easier studying!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried alot of this type of app and keep coming back to this one.  If you could get auo date entry into the title that would be perfect. Use it every day now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is in my opinion the best note taking app. I like the unrestricted page size and the intuitive and easy to use interface. The s-pen support is very good and it distinguishes whether you are using your finger or s-pen and you can have them perform different actions. What I would like is ability to input text with a bigger font size. Even the largest is quite small compared to the background ruling. Textbox scaling and automated fitting to the box would be good. Now that must be done manually."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it daily for my math class"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All features to make the best note taking app I've used. I can't believe it is free :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is really vast!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best note saving application i have ever used simply incredible :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been writing with pencil on paper for all my lectures for years and then scanning those notes digitally to store them on dropbox for quick access on all my devices. Now I use the s pen and my note 2 to take all my notes directly to digital and on dropbox using papyrus. It automatically timestamps and keeps notes in correct module folders. Saves me a good chunk of time on scanning and organizing the paper notes. The future of note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, you've done a great job. This is the closest that you get to the notability app for iOS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for school note taking on samsung note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"When will it have voice recording and upload to google drive?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recommended for all entrepreneurs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Do not change a thing. Beware of bloat ware. Keep It Simple Son (K.I.S.S.) Come up with another great idea for another piece of software. Excellent software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It's very easy to use. I just rated 4 because I think it could improve some of its features, like the shape tool. It could have a smart shape tool like S note has. Also it could have an easy way to insert pictures from the clipboard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick. Precise. Simple. Highly effective. Has sped up, and organized my note taking. Galaxy Note 8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice and user-friendly"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great. Needs a template with a margin. Scrolling can be slow at times but overall excellent app especially with the cloud backup add on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just amazing how well created app this is. Works exactly like notebooks we use in real life."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"First impressions are very good, I want to get the cloud services option but Google dive isn't supported! Any plans for this?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Unleash your creativity, use Papyrus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"This app as the others is absolutely not accurate. There is a huge lag when writing and your hand note are worst than when you learn how to write.   However, like I said it is the same with other apps...when a good app will come ???? Bamboo on the iPad is perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love love love this app, been using it for 2 months now for all of my Calculus notes! I have the free version but am thinking about updating to the paid version!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app that could use some more features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Works flawless. Easy to use. Notebooks are good times. Maybe needs a new way in organizing recent notes but overall good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Only problem is it keeps popping up the dashboard when i rest my hand on the tablet screen which is slightly annoying"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Recently got a Galaxy Note 10.1 and, using this app, I've stopped carrying paper notebooks to my lectures.  I'm giving it five stars because, as far as tricky such as the feel and flow of using it with the S-pen, none of the other apps available come close.  In still holding hope for some features to be added, but I wouldn't replace this app for anything."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a really nice app. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Haha. Have to pay $3.29 to access what should be standard features such as typing text into note, shapes and eraser. Surprise charges annoy me. Why not just charge for the app? Bamboo Paper is nicer than this for handwriting and drawing anyway. Uninstall!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Unlike several note-taking apps as for example NoteLedge PRO = paid for, the notes STAY PUT in the Papyrus = when you save your notes, they don't DISAPPEAR! The notes stay put and are still there whenever you reopen the program! Thanks Papyrus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have used Several of these apps including S note and Handrite (paid version) .. Hands down this app is the best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very pleased with the features and function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best writing app for android, butnlack the pdf file import."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best S pen app for Samsung by far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just flawless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great and simple app for note taking, could do with more features for sorting and filing /tagging notes and notebooks, or an easier way to review many notes though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Been using this more so than S note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Makes taking notes at meetings a breeze."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take pictures for documentation and write on them. It's great for that!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I had been looking for. Now if there could be a calendar to write on....I would be exceedingly happy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is incredible. It does a lot, and does it all well.  Also, the s-pen support is epic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best of them all"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works wonders for the Sony Xperia Z Ultra. Make sure you set the active pen option in the settings and then you can use a pencil to draw/write with whilst your finger becomes an eraser!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is so far the best note taking app. Vector based its perfect for mind maping and diagram drawings. The biggest advantages: text box ( text can be moved and placed), vector based drawings can be moved at the paper, easy to learn. Disadvantages: no text options, text is not showing up directly on the page but in a box above the keyboard, drawings are linear, no fill. Updates are coming and it has potential to replace S note forever."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing tons of features useful for note taking in college courses."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best spen app there is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great tool and I like the PDF upload to Dropbox feature, but a two-way sync or at least hourly (or direct) upload would be essential to really use it.  As it is now the money for the Cloud Extension is a bit wasted. Also it is annoying that the advanced features are only available as in-app purchase and thus have to be bought again for a second device. Because of this two limitations only four stars (would give 3,5 if available)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than samsung native spen app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would give it five stars if it weren't for 2 things. First, hide the android soft keys so that i don't close the app or back out of a note when writing, causing loss of notes. Also, I would like to see an option for filling, like the fill option in Paint, so when I can shade a region of a graph in my notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, using with Note 8.0 for university!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Find it even more accurate then S-notes that Samsung gives."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Where have you been?  I'm so glad I found this app. It works Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fun and dependable app for notes. Much better than s note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the first note taking app that I like.  Simple and very easy to use, especially with the S-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Definitely love it, it's awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than s-pen for just jotting down a quick note.   Kinda wish you had an option for typing a note too, but I use it all the time.  Definitely recommend.  :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I find it so much easier to use than the stock Samsung note taking software. You can lean on the screen to write. Reorganise and resize notes. Work on A4 and then back it up as a PDF on dropbox. Well worth the money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is an awesome note  taking app for S-Pen enabled devices like my Galaxy Note 2.  The optional graph paper backgrounds and ability to copy/paste/move strokes are very helpful when sketching floor plan ideas.  My one complaint is that I can't simply export the resulting page as a PNG or PDF onto my SD card; I have to share it with some program (like by emailing the image to myself).  OK, two complaints: I'd like to be able to copy an entire page so I can modify it, or at least be able to lasso-select the entire contents of a page at once rather than just the limited amount that will fit on the screen.  Allowing me to zoom out as far as I wanted so that the whole page would fit on the screen would help me work around this limitation.  Why is the zoom range limited?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has replaced SNote for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think it's got better pressure detection than the stock note app too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great free app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If it could fix the low resolution of images imported, this would be an automatic 5+ stars! Also, it'd be nice if we could have custom backgrounds. Oh, and perhaps if it could import notes from the S note? That would be sooo amazing! Other than that, this is pretty much the best writing note-taking app I've tried"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great on my Note 2. Needs Evernote and Drive support desperately, but locally does everything it needs to do"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I take my school notes in papyrus and i love it :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs presets and highlighters."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Everything Ive expected from stylus not app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It is the best note taking app I've come across for the note 8. The only reason it only gets 4 stars? Where's the widget? Give us a widget Papyrus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I thought Papyrus is like an endless Papyrus paper, you can scribble as long as you can until a limit in one page.   The lag using my S Pen is significant, which is what everyone doesn't want in the first place.   S Pen gestures don't work. The global gestures are registered instead.   I'll reinstall one day and see if there's been any rectification."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It so simple and I really like it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish i had a pen for my s3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Probably the best note taker I've used. Occasionally I'll get a false reading and it'll move the paper instead of write, but I don't know if it's the program, my stylus, or my finger bumping the screen. Hell I even bought the shape pack to support your work. A curve line a la Paint would be useful for my math class, but it's still quite good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I completely switched from paper to Papyrus to take notes in clase and I'm never going back"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just found out that it is Samsung's fault that the S-Pen button is not functional on third party apps. Setting that aside, this is a highly productive app, however I will be sticking to SNote due it's buttom functionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellant product"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great concept... Just a pity the actual drawing lags behind the contact on the device..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very Responsive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"plz provide pdf import functionality sir"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Better writing function, please. I have the note 10 and this app's control for writing is really bad. I also would suggest that it remembers my orientation or display zoom when writing. It is frustrating when i have to zoom in and out whenever I write a new page.  Stationaries and customization would also be nice too. Infinite page, maybe?  That is all that is lacking. Other than that, it's a great journal app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent app to use with a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Note 2......s note works from the getgo... if you advertise s pen functions the user shouldn't have to jump thru hoops to get it to work. Better s note alternatives out there. uninstalled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Exactly what you need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gooood"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app!  Best one out there!  Two things for wish list: 1) Ability to see the text that is being typed on the note page.  2) Ability to rotate an object or text (especially a pasted object)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic better than galaxy s note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works Well!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"would be better if there was an option for magnify glass input for when writing with a Capacitive pen instead of a digitizer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I was looking for something like this. It is easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good program to take note using s pen from samsung. We need fast way to change the pen color and pen type"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I often sketch, write, doodle, graffiti, etc...& this is my favorite app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Slow on my nook HD+"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Every other app works fine recognizes and show what I write smoothly. But this app lags when I write. I mean it doesnt feel natural ,after 2 secs or so the handwriting appears. The problem is only with this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than the native S - Note app on many levels. However, I can't use the pen gestures. Please fix for 5 stars, and I just might buy the text tools package too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really great for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would like to have small app widget for my Xperia Z."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect note taker"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is an excellent software which makes life easy. It will be the best if it will give us cloud support for syncing our notepad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This totally should replace the S Note. Colour picker pops out very fast. Not like S Note. Erasing has never been easier just by using fingertips. Feels very snappy. Awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app to save trees while I take notes in my college classes.  Easy to use, edit, and study from."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bought a Samsung Note 8 and this works perfectly with it-best thing since sliced bread!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"No issues, but I would like a ""night mode"" with a dark background and white ink. Easier on my eyes. Also, a shortcut of double tapping with the pen to start a new note (as with s-note) would be useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time for my uni studies."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lovelyyy wonderful must for note users. I thank the makers of this with gratitude.  I hope they develop this and many more with success. Thank you	This is a great app for part time writers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is easy to organize. I make notebooks for each class and a note for each class session. I love  that I can rest my hand on the screen and write. (tip: it's easier if you are wearing long sleeves. Otherwise I end up pulling up the toolbar at the bottom of my screen that shows my notifications, but that is not an issue with the app itself.)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The hand writing feels so much more natural than S-Note does on my Galaxy Note 2. Great Holo Light user interface. Would like better compatibility with the button on the S-Pen though. Right now on stock T- Mobile update the button doesn't change to the eraser even though it's set in the options. Other than that I definitely prefer it over S-Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app but the other week it crashed and deleted all of my notes, bit slow with the scrolling and lags with the stylus. Still a great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is easy to take notes in meetings and then save as pdf."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Seems to work pretty well on my Note II."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app on my Galaxy Note 8.0 is perfect for taking notes and writing out calculations for my maths PhD. Was happy to pay for backup and PDF export to Box and DropBox. Great app and look forward to future features and addons."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it to tske notes, and love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I'll never use a notebook again and can do much more with it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For me is the best app to get the best of my Samsung Note tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I tried all other apps and found this one to be the best. Developer's get back to you if you email them a problem."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great s pen app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app, practically excellent to work.thanks for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The lack of ability to import a PDF makes this app worthless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need eraser icon to prevent accidental erasure, pen diff color will be nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for taking notes in class and doing homework/scratchwork."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Behaves for the most part like paper, as it should."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Needs to ignore hand. Can you write legibly without leaning your hand against the surface? Probably not, making this app useless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking class notes on my Galaxy Note 10.1! I love the eraser tool, it's fast and easy to use. The palm rejection works really well too!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very smooth and great for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used them all, and love this one the most. It brings the best of both the digital world together with the real world."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this as my primary note taking appfor electronics, Physics and Calculus lectures because it ""feels"" likeactual paper (size, pen , thickness and stuff ).   I really reaIly really like to record audio during lectures and hate having into open another app when I need to make record audio, not to mention having to remember to stop recording and then having to remain the bloody recording .   Another problem is that I hate the popup field thingy that Pops up every time i want to use the hand writing keyboard .I want to be able to place the text anywhere i want while i still see the rest of the  I would also like it if I could drag and drop diagrams to the current note just like s -note ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has finally y gotten to the point where I actually use the spen to take notes.   Combine with spen buddy and you get Papyrus show up whenever you pull out the pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use note 2 and 10.1 so i'd like the capability of sharing original file (not pdf) berween devices. And like other reviewers have brought up: a highlighter, change of background (at least its color), copy-paste capability, and google drive support. 4 stars from me, there's always room for improvement. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great even on my Nexus 4"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I do simple sketches so this was very useful. Just would like more options (shapes and the ability to choose which colors I want saved to say the least) wouldn't recommend for professionals. Would recommend for those that are are too poor for drawing tablets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Cannot get to work onmy device. Uninstalling."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I am a college student and got a tablet for textbooks and now that i found this app, for note taking at lectures or meetings! I tried a few others and this is the best in regards to simplicity in layout and function. Straightforward design in regards to switching between poem and eraser, excellent copy tool and that's all I've needed! Exporting to Google Drive is another crucial feature, the save and export functions are easy to use.  4 starts bc it takes time to start up or to load when you switch back to it after using another app. Also, a nested folder structure (i.e. folders within folders) would be greatly appreciated! So speed it up, add nested folder structure and this is the best note taking app for android! Keep it free!  I've wanted to recommend this app to friends that have iPads, but this isn't out yet for iOS, do it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It looks nice and clean... But without auto scroll on zoom, you just can't use it... And I so want an app like this for android"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As a student I've tried almost all of the handwriting apps available and so far papyrus has had the best functionality. The handwriting recognition is a lot more precise than other apps and it does well with inserting pictures without being overloaded. I used S Note for a while and even though it had great options and tools, it stopped saving if there were too many pages or pictures inserted. The one thing I'd love to see in Papyrus is more aesthetically pleasing page backgrounds. A lot of the other handwriting apps have multiple design and color options. Even a softer cream colored background would be a great improvement to the stark white they have now. Other than that, it's great! Perfect for taking notes during lectures and studying from later on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Two things that would it better, ability to change note cover look and ability to export to Dropbox more often."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"One of the better ones out there, but still needs some improvements."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it whenever I want to take notes in a forum where pen and paper are more socially acceptable than hovering over a keyboard."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not perfect, but very very good compared to everything else on the market right now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A little better organized compared to note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good stuff!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could u please add google drive as cloud option? Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well with the S-pen. Additional tools sold as an IAP are a must! I prefer this over several note-taking apps I tried. Just waiting for music composition paper-type."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Nice interface, but to jittery to be useful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. flexible."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application. Hope they implement more cool stuff to compete with Samsung Notes/Memo. Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it for everything.  Notes for class, work, church, everything. What I like the most is the very simple way organization is set up. Notebook>notes. That simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could do with the ability to delete and shuffle individual pages. More file management options!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Any stylus app MUST have palm rejection. It is a requirement. Papyrus doesn't have it, so it can't be written on. It's a good app but it doesn't serve its purpose. I easily disagree with those who think this app is better than S Note, as S Note is much more a suite than just a note-taking app, and has many more features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, I would give it a 5 but the lack of access to images on the clipboard and not being able to import pdf, stops me from giving it a 5. Because of those 2 missing features, I still have to rely on s note to pick up the slack"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus makes it so easy for me to organize my thoughts. I absolutely love it and have recommended it to friends looking for note taking apps."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would like to have a full screen widget and the ability to send handwritten message."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried more note taking apps than I want to think about. This one is by far the best one I've found. It responds very well to the s-pen and keeps my notes organized forall my classes. It syncs with Dropbox, but not Google drive. I wish the zoom options were better, but it's still the best ans I use it every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a must for any college student."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could do with a paste function, but other than that it is very good."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Samsung's own S Note is put to shame by Papyrus's clean, true-to-Android interface. I'd like it even more if there was an OLED-friendly ""night mode"". On the other hand, the in-app purchase model is inherently evil. Until there's a separate premium app with everything unlocked I'm not going to pay a cent."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for my samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is an awesome app. Note taking is FUn with this app. Ialso like the ability to export my notes to pdf Great-job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like the features in my Galaxy Note Tablet SNote application but Papyrus is superb. I can move stuff around with it and quickly erase a mistake. I love the infinite size option. This has become my favorite app for taking notes in my computer science classes. I can also export them to PDF to share our print them."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"You can leave your friends behind"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The you pay and pay."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this in college classes and the format is just like paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app would be awesome if you could type on it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app - very smooth note taking - even my 3 year old loves scribbling on it	Have compared the ease of use between Quill and Papyrus, and find Papyrus superior, both in terms of note taking and organizing the notes. I use it with my Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet and find using my stylus on this app smooth. One feature I would love to see is integrating PDFs with the natural note taking ability of Papyrus. Instead of loading ruled pages in the background, what if Papyrus could load PDFs in the background and once annotating is done, save the annotations back to the PDF. That would be useful - most PDF readers are pretty lame for stylus based annotations currently."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"...if the app support the adonit jot touch stylus, so I could jot down my notes for maths and other subjects that are very note heavy, while resting my hand on the screen.  Thank You,  Liam."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time. It is great for meetings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Title says it all. I am tired of hovering my hand over the screen while I use my stylus. Add a hover check and 5 stars it is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost flawless app for handwriting notes on my note 8.0, and beats S-note and Lecturenotes in all but one category: pasting. How hard would it be to add a paste from clipboard feature under the insert picture section? I'll rate a 5 as soon as I get that update."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"In one word, this app is LEGIT.  It's simple and the UI is intuitive.  I was using Lecture Notes for taking class notes, but was really let down by the experience.  I'll be switching to Papyrus as my main note taking tool.  Fantastic job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"May sound extreme. But I have been looking for this sort of app for ages. Makes the purchase of Note 2 worthwhile. I was a ferocious diary writer 10 years back but then the physical diary fell into wrong hands, I quit after that. Tried keyboard method and digital diary, it just does not seem the same. But now, this, if you are like me, who writes a lot physically and not happy with digital then.... you have found your heaven."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for handwriting, and was even better when you could insert pictures/photos, etc. You just can't erase said photos.  Or move them, especially when they fall accidentally on top of your handwritten notes. That should be basic, shouldn't it?  Update: After realizing my learning curve (thanks for the reply!) all is well.  Extra star!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish there was an option like the original S pen. The pop up option!!   Open papyrus automatically when pulling out the S pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent APP"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this app its good for students and it does everything"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could possibly improve pen sense circle onto screen level."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works way better than sNote.  May as well call S note sNOT"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Writing is not smooth at all. Very jumpy and glitchy when trying to write. Super Note from Asus is far superior."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works very well with my Galaxy Note II"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Only thing I missed after rooting and replacing the rom on my note 2 was the Samsung spen app. This replacement app is even better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Vector graphics support is the best. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Incredible app! Love how it can keep scrolling down as I write. The way it reads pressure sensitivity from the pen is pretty good!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is probably the only useful note taking app is used. Galaxy note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm...exports nicely"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I installed this program for my tablet but when I tried taking notes, it just brought up a box when I tapped the icon to write."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Believe me I have almost speed using the default Samsung note app.. awesome app! !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"keep up the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Extraordinary to use with the NoteII"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's what I was looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"5 stars when we can sync with Google accounts. Otherwise, pretty impressive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Why isn't Samsung Note tablet native drawing Ul/API this simple and unobtrusive? Two actual usability issues: 1) Even if a note is stored in a folder, recent notes does not show the name of the folder the note is in. Sometimes I move a note in a folder and because of a motoric error it ends up in the wrong folder. Since there is no ""sort notes by last moved to folder"", it gets really hard to find a note in such situation. 2) Accidental generation of notes: I often press the add new note button without thinking. Then I perhaps leave papyrus on in the background. I end up closing the note at some point but don't remember if I wrote something in it. Then it gets annoying since I need to check if the note has contents - that does not necessarily show in the note icon - before deleting the note, to make sure I don't delete anything that matters. So not saving notes at all before they have any content or their name set would probably be a good idea.  Also, I would like a fill tool. I understand it may go against your philosophy but really, in practice, I often want a coloured canvas to paint on first for example. Or just fill a shape."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thing is cooler than anything I've ever seen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very usefull app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I'll just stick with paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Im in college and I use it to take notes in class. Its easy to organize everything and reads my handwriting perfectly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app all the time to jot down quick notes. I find it much easier to use then S-note for my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. Thanks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app updated, and ALL my notes are gone! As I use this for work, I'm devastated.  Definitely uninstalling and never touching this again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"What a worthless app. Double whammy on the lame ""upgrades""  Being treated like this just makes me mad. The ONE cool thing is the ""use finger to erase""  I'll give them a star for that. The rest is de rigueur."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Use it to take notes in my graduate nursing classes--the  ability to export effortlessly to dropbox is great! Also works seamlessly with printershare. The thing that would give it 5 stars? ADD A HIGHLIGHTER PLEASE!!!!!! A voice recorder and the ability to create notebooks within notebooks would be fantastic as well!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would definitely pay for premium if I could upload notes to Evernote. I hope you look into adding that in the future. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I purchased because I read a comic artist sketched using it, and it has been a boon to my workflow! I can just doodle anything that comes to mind in my Galaxy Note 2, and I can export and finish on my PC (the paid features make it even more intuitive).  As a hobbyist, every minute with a digital sketchbook helps me grow as an artist. Great job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this app more than anything else on my note2. Love the functionality! Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excelente aplkcacion he sustituido cuadernos por la tab con esta app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I bought my galaxy note tablet and this was the first third party app I used. I love it. I also bought the text tools package as well. I do wish that the writing was as fluid as the native snote app, but I can understand that they are working to improve the features. I have had a small problem of lag lately while writing, I'm not sure if it is my tablet or the app itself, but it surely doesn't keep me from jotting notes. I also love the UI compared to other writing apps!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i'm actually willing to buy the extra tools. but even without them, this app is perfection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome alternative for spen to write. Easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No complaints"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please add an option which would allow us to use white ink on completely black pages. It would be perfect for AMOLED displays and also be much easier on the eye. Other than that, it's perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I bought the text pack for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and it works great. I go to use it on my Motorola Xoom and it says I have to buy it again! I am not buying it twice. If you could make so you only have to buy it once, I would give it five stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this for all my note taking at work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"way better than S-Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app is great. Nearly perfect, in fact. The only thing holding it back is the fact that there is no ability to sync your notes and notebook to Google Drive. Seeing as it is running on Android, I don't understand why it isn't an option. Without Drive, its usefulness to me is severely limited. Add that, and I'll change my review to 5/5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful app.  Could be improved by adding a smoothing algorithm to handwriting and better use of write-to-type."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing App for taking notes in school"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Shape tools hidden under pencil. And cost extra."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very handy, but sometimes over-sensitive and the pen gestures are sometimes difficult to do."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus quickly became my favorite way to take notes in class. I write with cheap stylus in math classes and use a Bluetooth keyboard for more writing intensive classes. One feature that would take this way above and beyond for me as an economic major would be the ability to graph a small equation."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy the application, the only issue I have with it is when I'm writing, sometimes the writing seems rather jittery and jagged.  It usually happens when I'm not trying to write quickly, but it's enough to bug me.   I'm using a Galaxy Note 2, and if it weren't jittery like it is, it would be absolutely perfect.  This app is the only one that appears like this.  On S Note or any other app, it appears smooth as silk.  Other than that, though, it's great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gets the basics *really* right."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app would be wicked to use on a large tablet, so many cool case scenarios. Combine thus with Google Drive or Evernote and it's even more wicked. Now I need to buy the Google Nexus 10."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does a good job"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think this is awesome. I use it for everything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for that makes use of the S-pen and does it very well. Support is also excellent with a special feedback forum."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. I use it every day at work. Get rid of the pen lag however for 5 stars. I just tried lecture notes and there is no lag there. Might switch to it for the more natural feel."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT - I can see what I'm doing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to use nice interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"It needs to have the ability to have some private files so hide some files and pass code.  I will change my rating to 5 stars when the above happens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No one has produced such a fluid,  powerful handwriting notes app for Android. It truly mimics paper. I have been looking to transition my daily notes from paper for months now and it is so great to finally have a genuine solution that delivers what is expected."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Smooth operation.  Very intuitive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is amazing on note devices with the s pen! Only mediocre on regular tablets and phones. Its revolutionized how I take my notes on my note 2 and 8 love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I hate it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it wish I could scroll down"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"After using applications like Notability on my school iPad I find this app to lack key features. The application needs to have a built in voice recorder and automatic write scrolling this way I wouldn't have to mess with zooming so much. The application could have different pen styles like markers or stencils. If the paper color could be changed i would much appreciate it. Also I am unable to move uncategorized notes into a notebook. Copy and pasting image capabilities would be nice. I have been using this for a while and these improvements would make life easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the concept! This is just what I've been waiting for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So fun...thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"exactly what i was looking for. only downside is the lag of display after dragging page"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ya heard"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 if had better layer and grouping support..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Some feedback: Sometimes when I sketch intensely the line might disappear from time to time. Seems to happen near edges."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great note taking app, but I wish the insert image feature would allow full resolution imports. I wanted to a annotate some scans I imported but it was too pixilated. Other than that it's a superb app for taking handwritten notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My favorite for taking notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"My stylus nor my finger would work. I tried and tried but it wouldn't detect my pen. Deleted app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does a good job with the s-pen and great to be able to use my finger as an eraser (though sometimes not as easy to do fine work)  Notebooks keep everything organized.  Daily use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The hand writing isn't shap, the eraser is a bit clumsy, and no many options to highlight sentences, but its a fairly good experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent writing app. Could be better if it had a widget allowing a pop up page to write notes. Love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Mind you, its the only one I've downloaded. Works really well with the G-HUB stylus I got with my Nexus case."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have no idea what changed (might be it was a system problem), but the app is just fine now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great application, I love it, I'm using it with my note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"عالی است"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The pressure sensitivity of the s-pen doesn't work as well.  Half of the time, the software does not recognize that the pen tip is on the tablet when I am writing.  Also, when it does,  the strokes start of either heavy and then abruptly turn skinny OR vice versa. There isn't a smooth transition even if I smoothly apply pressure or slowly let go of the pressure.  Also, the brush strokes are ""twitchy"".  I think every s-pen for the samsung note 8 OR the 10.1 version have a little bit of give on the tip -- very, very slight give because of the pressure sensitivity mechanism (I have both s-pen versions) .  When writing on the tablet, this ""give' causes the brush strokes to not be smooth; I think the stock samsung software accounts for this and slightly smooths out the strokes making my hand written notes look a lot better and more natural.  However,  the stock software doesn't do copy and paste.  The Papyrus software does and it does it really well.  This is one of the reason why I tried Papyrus.. I hope the author continues to work on Papyrus though.  Even with all the negatives, it is a good program..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is geting better every day. A must have Galaxy Note II users. Tottaly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it's nicer and much simpler than s-note, but i have some gripes and ideas to improve them, hope the dev reads this:  -custom page layout/more page layout. i really want the lined one with middle page vertical margin for the fixed page sises -multi-notebook/folder -tags/automatic names using date and time -manual magnification (enter the percentages manually) and fixed default xoom (so when add new note/open note, goes to a preset magnification (not 100%)  other than that it's very good, keep up the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"want the ability to write on the whole tablet just like a pad of paper - not just a conversion screen at bottom. want the ability to convert to text but not automatic - of course accuracy is critical - sorry papy if not accurate, want to be able to easily edit wrong conversions love that Papyrus has the ability to erase with my finger. Papyrus does have the ability to share my notes in an accessible (PC and android) system - like Evernote but only as pdf, jpeg or png.  spoiled by MS OneNote that I used on a PC tablet.  It did all these things but finger erase. MSO on Android is a few steps backwards including the ability to simply write -  hate going backwards in technology."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Handwriting app ever"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app does what it says it does. One thing I would like to see is Palm Rejection or a Palm Pad. When writing on a tablet, or mobile using a Stylus/Pen as soon as your hand touches the screen, the writing ability of the Stylus/Pen is disabled."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for the s-pen I have tried. Simple and effective."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works even better with a pen. Using it as my notebook for all the classes. Simply great !!.  I just thing it would be nice if there was the option for custom zoom option. That is, to click on a button and input the zoom level I want. I usually work on a specific zoom level and sometimes the zoom isn't stable using the fingers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It just gets better and better. For whatever reason I didn't think that this would get updated anymore, turns out that isn't true. The add-ons are a great buy in case anybody is wondering."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I use Papyrus on a daily basis because it is very good. Still I only rate it 2stars because it is still missing the basic functionality that every note taking app has.  For example: it is impossible to see if a note has a next page or not. You just have to try in each note you open to press the next button. If you get a blank page then there was no next page... Gets very annoying after a time. How difficult can it be to just put an indicator like ""page 1of 6""?  There is also no way the system remembers your zoom-level. I like to zoom out on a page when I open a note to see all the contents on a page. Then, when going to the next page, it forgets about this and zooms back tot the default. If you quickly want to browse through the pages of a note to look for something, then you have to zoom out or pan on every page of the note. I am getting really tired of this.   The developer seems to be concentrating on adding more advanced features, but forgets about the basics.  The good part of Papyrus is the actual writing. The most fluid and easy to use of all the apps I tried. The fact that you get a nice PDF copy in your dropbox is a killer feature."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant Note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Update- the new updates are just what I've been waiting for. Truly a 5 star app...and I'm very picky. I have hundreds of pages of notes and the new features are awesome. I have one note for chemistry lab notes and it is so helpful to open a note to the .east page instead of clicking all the way to the end. Other notes I export to PDF and file away. Next we new GoogleDrive sync. Excellent app!! ************* I love this app. I use it on my Galaxy S3 and my Note 10.1. Amazing. It has replaced all my handwritten notes, and I'm the type of guy who loves to take abundant notes when I study. This app works great. I'm having problems adding images into notes, however. I album wish there was a way away change the view... Maybe a list view instead instead of thumbnails of each note. It gets a bit cluttered with all the thumbnails. I highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app on the market!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"His is a very useful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you for a very user friendly tool.  The upgrade features are a great Value!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Papyrus along with the paid ""plug-ins"" on a daily basis. Very customizable and feature rich.  Really like that I can turn my larger S Pen around and use it like an eraser.  Works perfectly on both my Samsung Note 2 and Note 8 tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally a good notes app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could do with some different templates such as ""To-Do"" etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good.  Its like using a pen and paper.  Only wish it could convert the writing into text."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this app on a daily basis for taking notes in class. It with my Thinkpad Tablet and the active pen works great. I love how I can write with my pen then erase / pan / zoom with my figures. The seemingly infinite page size  and high zoom possibilities makes writing notes much better than with the old pen and paper.  4 stars because we are missing some features form other writing apps 1.  Pen Hover cursor !!! 2. When reopening a Note the app should remember what page i was on.  3. Drawing predefined shap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just a shame about the user interface icon - makes it look cheap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not bad and fair asking price for additional features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything about the software works great with Note except l wish the eraser could erase part of a pen stroke Instead of the whole thing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nexus 7. I don't know how many of these I have tried out to date. Had I found this earlier I would have avoided a great deal of disappointment and wasting my time. This one does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am fascinated by it. I am going to use it over the next few weeks to see how it fairs in every day use but I already have a strong feeling that I will be sticking with it and ditching all the others.  24th July 2013: I have been using this app now for a few weeks and I am very happy with it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app of you have a Note tablet or phone!  It is simple and closely resembles a sheet of paper. It is far more effective and useful than the SNote application that comes with with Note products.  The great part of this app is that it's free and it's useful without the extra addons --Although, I ended buying them all and I find that they add value to the product.  I also found that the paid features migrated to my Note 2 phone when I installed it.  I am also using a Note 10.1 tablet.  The company also has great support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice and user friendly just hope that any kind of pen can be used for the program delivers accurate writing style."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The only feature that would make this app better is if I could make annotations. For that reason it gets four stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Like this app so much. Really help in making notes and very easy to use. No more paper notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Extremely great app, my run to app for notes and annotation. S-pen integration great. Would be awesome if you had basic picture editing processes such as brightness and contrast as inserted photos from device often need a bit of tweaking. Would be great if there was a highlight tool, a simple feature that wouldn't require much change to the app. Saving directly to the device would also be a plus instead of having to export to some to email or bluetooth ... overall great simple clean app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app I've seen in a long while.  I really love the infinite page with the ability to have separate pages."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A brilliant app for sorting and adding notes !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent writing note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app has been great so far, I use it only to sketch but I've noticed that it really likes to suck all the juice out of the battery.   Would love it if that was fixed some how.   Note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with the s-pen!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The premium features aren't premium enough. I bought the Tools Pack but only a few extra items made available. The Cloud Services is limited to only Dropbox and Box. I can always export and share notes with other cloud storages, including Ubuntu One without having to purchase the Cloud services. Overall, excellent app. But neither of the extra worth the price tag."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just plain handy"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Quick and simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Two reasons...   1) they added shortcut support  2) You can move things around on the page...   Horrible omission on SNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Brilliant for plant engineers, but would like to delete pages in a note.	I am a plant engineer. This app is perfect for making notes of issues and problem solving activities. One thing: It would be great if it were possible to delete a whole page within a note."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use this to take notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"What I like: drawing options. Friendly/ easy interface. Notebooks. Autosave. Almost everything.  Wish list: 1) More background options: colors and textures. 2) floating notes, and 3) templates (like S-note).   Still like it better than the competition, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great with S Pen on Galaxy Note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If only there was a widget showing an entire note I would have given 5 stars!  Ace program, my favourite for notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Interface is simple and the infinte page is amazing jusr one thing it doesnt have feature of change the pen color through the s pen button"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Possibly the best app for writing and taking notes out there right now!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Will buy all premium features to support your project"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I currently have Quill, LectureNotes (paid), Power Note, Handy Memo, and FreeNote on my tablet - all of which are about to be uninstalled.  I have been in search of an app that will allow me to write notes in class, can easily scroll, allows for inserting images and adding text to the images, and can then upload to Evernote - all of which this app does. Papyrus recognizes my Adonis Jot without skipping, and I like that it is also pressure sensitive."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this as my primary note taking app on my Galaxy Note 8. It has been great. I love the organization, the simplicity, the swipe to delete with a finger stroke. Easily a 5 star app. There are a couple of paid for features that ace worth it as well. Highly reccomended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Its a really nice app. It could be great if it could convert the handwritten letters to typed fonts."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"I do not make in app purchase.  Other than that would have used it.  Uninstall"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is flat out beautiful. Wish the addons weren't so pricey, but everything else looks and works beautifully."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for maths and physics."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Using with Galaxy Note 2, love multi window support. Works acceptably, best of the notepad stylus apps I've seen yet. Like the multi-touch gestures."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"text highlighter should be implemented as soon as possible, along with page management (being able to delete individual pages is essential)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Impressed with the ease of use. Using the Samsung Note 8 with Spen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My only suggestion would be add the ability to move existing notes into new notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just love it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"No comment at this time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Better than stock app by far. Add a couple features and it would be amazing.	So much more natural and easy to write in this app. I like that it can automatically open like the default S Note app. Developers, hear me out on this idea (I'd pay $) : -Give me the option to continually write without having to stop and manually scroll down. Say I fill the page I'm on, it would be SO helpful if I could move my pen back up to the top of the page and proceed to write over what is already there, but it changes automatically to a new page instead. Like an infinite, automatic scroll."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is absolutely brilliant when actually writing, but it's a little lackluster when it comes to sorting notes. You can't rearrange the order of notes in a particular notebook, nor can you tag notes with keywords. It's cloud backup service also lacks Google Drive support.  If these features don't matter to you then I highly recommend this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If only it provides a way to sync my notes and notebooks across multiple Android devices it would be the perfect app.km"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to use and also brilliant!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Crippleware"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The free one is Very good and uncomplicated app. Simple and highly efficent for note taking. Diary etc"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I hate digging through a bunch of notepads & scraps of paper, especially when it comes to meeting notes. This makes it so easy to keep information organized in one place. I plan on to have my elderly mom download it onto her nexus as well.  Thanks so much!  Brilliant!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wonderfully simple (why doesn't S Note allow text moving?). Amazing palm rejection! A bit too slow (on Note 8) in fullscreen to feel natural, but works great in multi window mode. Perhaps try not updating so much of the screen? Scroll/zoom could also show page while dragging. Would be great if  selection was a single tap away (e.g. pinning toolbar or adding to), or a tap gesture to replace pen button. A more off-white paper colour choice would be nice too at some point, as would search but that's a big ask."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has finally allowed me to let go of my paper notepads. The combination of Papyrus and The Galaxy Note devices (I have the 2 and the 10) is the first time I've gotten the same tactile feeling from a device as I get from pencil and paper. Add that to the infinite, vector based format of Papyrus notes, the graph or lined backgrounds, cloud storage, the masking tool, color and brush options... You end up with the next evolution in note-taking. The only (tiny) drawback has been the load times for some of my larger notes - the trade off for infinite page space is a few seconds loading it up. This can easily be avoided with proper organization, however. The app is of excellent quality, and I am grateful to the developers for improving the way I work and create."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Can only give 3 stars because it really needs the ability to delete and move pages. Would be 4 srars with that. Would be 5 stars if it had highliter + a few more edit options/tools."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great paper thanks to the a Nile River & Egyptians"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its everything you need. Easy controlls and all necessary features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An excellent program for note taking.The best feature that I like is that the page is endless.  Most other programs have this limitation that you need to change pages after you have run out of the little area that you have. But the biggest limitation is that the program does not allow saving on the cloud in the native format.  So if I format my phone,  then I only have pdf or jpg versions of the file which I can view but cannot edit. This means that effectively I lose my work each time that I factory reset."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great concept love the idea just doesn't work well for my phone I don't have the right type off stylists for this great app. So I'm going to uninstall it for now and book mark for a later time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love Papyrus but I wish you could import PDF and take notes on them. I read a lot of papers and I like to make notes as I read. Papyrus would be perfect for that but you can't import the PDF's"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very very usefull"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"una aplicación ùtil , ya poco falta para madurar para ganarse bien las 5 estrellas, lo que venga despues será un plus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only thing,  need to allow copy and paste images when working with two screen s at the same time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Worth the $6 for the extras.  And I'm cheap so that's saying something.  The dropbox pdf sync is awesome!	This is even better than s-note except you can't insert pictures and stuff.  For taking notes though, this app is king."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very useful so far but I think the text input could be done better have it go directly in to the note rather than in a pop up box"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I toggle between my"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Great to use. Clean UI. Works prefect with Samsung S-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has replaced a pen and paper for me. I use it everday in college to document my class notes. Although there are a few issues here and there and recommend this app along with the cloud storage add-on to upload notes to a Dropbox account."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Before I started using CyanogenMod, I used s note. Afterwards, I was often without a replacement. Now I actually have use for my stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just as the title says.  I've tried a lot of different apps on my Note II and this one is the best.  The premium feature to auto backup notes is really nice, since I take notes everyday.  As to what one user said, I purchased the cloud service, and then installed this on my tablet and the premium features where enabled as soon as I opened it up.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a great note taking app for Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This is good. But the default S-Pen app gives most of the features. Things like Lasso cut etc are inbuilt in Note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The program is solid and the best i have used so far. There are some shortcomings in efficient use while working with it, however, the guyz are upgrading and working on improvements continously. I cant expect more. Soon there will be a pdf annotation feature on and the writing performance is also being improved. Great app great job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Should be in gray and less bold so you read only if you want to. That way you will be able to see title of memo and interface will look cleaner. Would love widget option for instant editing or better yet an option to open for edits most recent modified on app launch, this could be launched using gestures from launchers like nova for example without further work by papyrus! Imagine swiping 2fingers down to instantly edit notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Works well with my note 2.  I like the way it emulates an actual notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Delivers exactly what it says."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Might be because it reminds me the times of my Palm Tx, but much improved! I feel more confortable taking notes by handwriting, so this app is appropriate.  It's easy to use, very responsive, and gives you options to create and organize notebooks easily. Go for it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Somehow, Write, from Stylus Labs is better and free. I'm loving Write on my Note 8"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you very much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but with minimal pix elation"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great support from the developer and the best electronic paper experience out there. The separation between pen and finger works perfectly and it is astounding that more apps don't use this paradigm. If you have an active stylus then you really should get this app.   I will be supporting and buying add ons for this wayinto the future,  pretty much the most used app on my tablet!  (Galaxy note 10.1)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I fell in love with the simplicity of this app the same day I tried it. Can't wait to see new features. With the finger eraser this app is a little magical :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great User interface.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great and easy to use app!"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Working great so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Probably the best app for jotting things down quickly!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the cloud backup feature"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would have been better if we can navigate within the page using s pen rather than 2-finger movement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I' be replaced my A5 notepad and haven't looked back."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The app itself is the best note taker I have found in Android. It only gets 3 stars because it only syncs with Box and Dropbox.  What about Sugarsync and the rest?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Has most of what I want in a handwriting app, except for searchable tags."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great little app, turns my Note into an really electronic notepad -I'm finally paperless!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is my favorite note taking app. I'm still hoping for an audio recording feature. Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program. Only thing that would make it better would be opening and annotanting pdf files. Other than that works great for home work and notes in my engineering classes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty darn good.  This app is a strikes a powerful  ballance between:   useful,  effective    &  minimalist / clarity    i really enjoy using this and its my.primary app for writing.   things great,  that i use:  > unlimited canvas size  >( but not at expense of making app crash )   >adjustable pen width   >page lay out templates >import pictures (& write on top off)  The only thing for me personally that prevents me writing 5stars Is that scroll at times erases my writing ( where u can arrow back to undo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Missing the good flow and feeling like s-note. As an app it's much better, but the lack of natural feel makes me go back to s-note all the time..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Feature-wise I'd say Papyrus is humble, however I really don't know why but the S-Pen works much better in Papyrus than any other application. Clearly much better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app lication"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Super fast and slick. Use it instead of snote. Beautiful app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its much lighter/faster than Samsungs S note, only wish we could set the app open options  So that it would open immediately on a new page without having to select it first...keep up the good work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"...and i have looked around and tried a number of these apps.  I like Papryus because it is easiest to use when just taking notes.  One improvement i would like to see is being able to have notebooks within notebooks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The program does what it says.   Amazing!  I take a picture of a hand written note and can then annotate it further,  and then send it to a friend.   I'm impressed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love Finger-eraser function so much."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If is way better than the included s note on Samsung note devices. It is the only app that comes close to the power of OneNote on windows desktop. Infinite page size option as in OneNote is available in this app.  A few suggestions: Option to set page color  Page templates would be an added bonus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A natural app for notes, really useful for that want to use pen features in vanilla rom. Keep up for the good work dev!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to create new notes sheet and classify them ,, what maybe it would be interesting is to have a zoom in space to write in big letters, and after they should take normal size in the note sheet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it daily."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"When the page is zoomed in and I'm trying to scroll to a new area, the new area takes a bit too long to load. This could be a bit inconvenient when I'm writing fast...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I just love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app out of the 4 or 5 I've tried"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"V useful writing app. If you could integrate this with a document viewer so that I could write notes on them, it would be ideal  Also, a hand-rest area (i.e. so that you can drag an area where screen presses are ignored so that I could rest my hand) would also make it easier to use - notes plus on iPad has something like this  Overall though it's the best not taking so I've used!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"For such an awesome app, I find it very disappointing that I can't delete or reorder the pages in notes. Also, an overview of all pages in notes is not possible. You must improve on this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just to add some feature of Snote like crop and paste by Spen I will rate 5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it. Just got Samsung Note 2 and it is my most used App.  Would prefer simpler Paste function. The ability to notate PDFs would be very useful.  I'd like to be able to design my own Page Types."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could do with the ability to create sub folders."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wish you put marker/ highlighter / copic function.  The rest is superb. Simple and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect for quick jots"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent to use on a samsung galaxy note 10.1 for class notes. I bought the premium features for backup and additional tools, of which I use the shape tools the most. I first started out with lecture notes app but found that the vector based papyrus was superior in visual fidelity. I gave up some good features in lecture notes but I'm hopeful the features of papyrus expand.  One feature I would like to see implemented is tagging notes/notebooks with topic,  keywords for easy search.   I would also like to see the ability to import (and annotate) pdfs. This would greatly help with natural flow because pdfs are currently handled by another app and I would prefer my notes all in one place."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Allows me to use my S Pen on an AOSP ROM with my Galaxy Note 2, priceless app and very well made"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Does job well"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really nice and clean app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Have nothing to complaint. A ""must have app"" to fully utilize your galaxy note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Awesome app, but why isn't a premium version on the market? I don't pay for features from within apps because when I reset my phone or use it on 2 Android devices I have to pay again. So sad, I would have paid if it were on the Marketplace. Guess I'll take a screenshot of my notes, covert the images myself, and upload them to my dropbox rather than pay every 2 months when I seem to do an unplanned factory reset to get rid of stray data on my phone."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please: add auto scrolling feature fhat supports the S pen when it is near the edge of the page. This app is great for drawing, notes, any S pen features. Features: colors, sizes & notebooks or pages for organization.	If you could add a scrolling feature that supports the galaxy note 2 s pen that would be swell."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Crashed, lost an hour of class notes. This is not acceptable from a note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the stylus write, figure delete option and endless canvas. Just wish it had more brush options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works well on the TF201."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, like a true notepad."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A great alternative to CADD   The advantages Papyrus over most sketching apps. is vector graphics, meaning all created objects can be edited (colour, position, thickness of lines or font size) at any stage of the sketch. Drawings remain sharp on zooming. It's infinite canvas size removes all drawing limitations.  Feature requests: Snap points for quick & clean junction of lines,orthogonal lines. rotation of objects, notes search in the list, a different layer for imported images and colour fill."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've never really reviewed an app before, but this is one app that I come back to, again and again. It foes everything that I need it to do, and then goes above and beyond. Thanks to Papyrus, I don't need any other note-taking apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"S Memo is better and free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Just need to find right pen for my nexus 7"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It helps a lot with taking notes while touring homes with my clients."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I love the fact that it's vector based, but having to pay for basic features (a true eraser, shape tools, keyboard input) is a big con for me. Palm rejection doesn't always work either; it sometimes moves around while I'm drawing or writing. I also wish it would allow me to save notes to an external SD card like my other note-taking apps. All in all, it's a great free app if you just want to make simple notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best handwriting note app for note 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended apps"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like this app, there are some features I would like to have but I think with time it will get there, I really recommend it. I do not use paper anymore and I'm using a Nexus 10."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note for galaxy note. The only thing I hope is more connectivity with other application so that it can import web pages directly from browser or from pocket."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great for taking notes at work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If the notes could be linked to a calendar view, I would vote this app as 10 stars."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is excellent app its. The easiest way to write as fast sa you can."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I read all reviews, and 90% of them were from those who have s pen, but this review is from the user of samsung galaxy grand with 10stylus in his hands(fingers of course). This app just rocks...Very good.i use it alot in my theoretical college lectures,but only 1 thing that i like about s memo and not in papyrus that in s memo u can easily insert sound clips and clip art which papyrus lacks...please make it available.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the stylus support for my Note 2. Just wish it also had a pc component that it would sync with."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Room for improvements: Recording that links w note page.  Page that can be titled for easy reference not just number page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn. Excellent for drawing quick diagrams and making notations on pictures. Notes are easy to share with others."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best sketching/note-taking app. Easy to sort notes into notebooks. Colors and pen size. Incredibly simple. No nonsense!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful with the s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Focused on note taking. Simple and works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"The app crashes after running for about a second... This app is screwing me over as I have all of my class notes on it and no way to get at them...  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED, it was a good app before..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"An excelent note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like this better than the Samsung S note, however the add-ons are a little expensive.  Merge the add-ons and charge $3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So superb."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Papyrus for work every day and have it set to activate as soon as I remove the S-Pen from my Note 10.1, which is unbelievably useful when needing to quickly take notes from a phone call. Palm Rejection works very well, and I really like the different backgrounds that are available (lined, graph, blank, etc). Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A must have app for enterprise,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you're running CM/AOSP/AOKP on your Note and can't use TW based S-note, this is a fine alternative. Great interface, cloud backup, simple layout. Add some screenshot/drawing/photo editing and this would be unstoppable!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"the best note app I've used so far. I would buy a pro Version with full features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, use it everyday for work notes, meetings and my own peronal notes. Customer support is excellent to deal with and they are always adding new features from user requests. Dropbox backup is great and notes always available on my laptop for viewing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Samsung S note is way to difficult to use on a daily basis. Papyrus and its feature to export notes to Dropbox automatically is awesome. Writing with pen is nice and erase with finger. Really well made. I would like to have automatic filename. Like date : 2013-05-28 if it had this feature I gave it 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app, and it serves almost everything I need for handwriting supported note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. Would be good if notes could be sorted into sub folders within the folders but other than that it is perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Toshiba Excite with ICS 4.0.  Program doesn't function as intended.  Pen does not work, therefore app is useless.  Uninstalling it.  Try again."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is the ideal tool for me to  think on paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is great. I use it for note taking on my Note 10.1, and even prefer it to Samsung's S-Note. The type tool could use improvement as of the latest version, especially as a paid addon-it currently pops up a text input box, instead of writing directly into the document like SNote. Having deeper notebook management would be nice, such as having notebooks within notebooks like Evernote. Overall one of the best note apps there is, especially for active pen devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"If you have a pen/stylus tablet (such as the Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet ver. 1) this is a must-have app.  The interface is simple.  The functionality -- including integration with Dropbox for backup as a premium feature -- is outstanding.  Papyrus has become the most-used app on my tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very well implemented and feels very simple and natural to use. I think great care and effort has been put into this app and it shows.   Too many of these note taking apps are either all style and no substance or have complex and unnatural interfaces.   This one shows how it should be done. Highly recommended.  PS. Reserving one star for future developments."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is such a great note taking up. It out does Snote in nearly every way.  I would love to see different pen/pencil types added, plus a facility for posting notes to the home screen as a widget.  GREAT JOB :0)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've been somewhat underwhelmed with the s pen so far with my Galaxy note 2. The native apps are okay,  and the other apps I found were okay too, but they are all fairly limited in some way for me.  I don't want to paint,  I don't want to belong to a new social network for doodles n etc. The Papyrus app seems more native than snote! It's very intuitive and allows me to take notes just as I do on paper.  Is awesome! !!!!! 5 big fat stars!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a good app for note taking. I like it better than s memo. But please make it so that the C Pen for the s3 has similar capabilities as the S Pen for other samsung devices. I tried the S Pen mode but the C Pen responds like a finger would and I would like to be able to write with the pen and scroll with my finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A fantastic app to rival S Note. My only bug with it is that there doesn't appear to be a scroll bar at the side/bottom when zoomed in, so I lose track of where l am on the page."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just some suggestions 1. Option to set default zoom of pages when opening any note 2. Pan page with single finger touch option"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is far more convenient than s note apps pre-installed in my Samsung galaxy note. Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very good, no more..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best snote app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has worked perfectly well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful app for S pen users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the app that finally made me use the stylus on my Galaxy Note II. Far better than the stock Samsung app. Quicker to launch, easier to access notes, good backup and export facility. I actually use it every day."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I can't rotate images, is the option implemented or not?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great with the S-pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Work great on my Sony Xperia tablet. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app use it for everything!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Top drawer app on Note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome practical the best app in the market for college students sand and for studying speciakky on note 10.1, for its pen and multi windows	Writing has a delay than actual pen or finger movement  Please fix this issue and its a five star  Its the best note taking app that I have seen in the market"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great apps for 5 stars just add pdf import. Good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not much else I can say"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great and even better with the Galaxy Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best I have tried, I have even purchased the premium features. Only thing missing is different pens/brushes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a rooted note 2 with a custom ROM that doesn't have S Note, and this is as good or better as a replacement."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm actually a samsung galaxy note 10.1. And I feel amazing about this app. It's quick and so easy to use. A can say good by to all of my notebook since I have papyrus. It's truly beyond paper!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this daily.  Folders within notebooks would be awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Not able to send files made can u help on this"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application constantly gets improved and updated. I have used Papyrus for half a year now, with my galaxy note 10.1 using the Cyanogen mod OS, and I have long since thrown away all my paper notebooks. I do all my handwriting work on the tablet with Papyrus; homework assignments, lecture notes and preparation for exams etc. And everything syncs up to Dropbox.   I am very impressed with the program, and it is good to see that every update brings some new cool feature into the code."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One and only best app for galaxy note 10.1 very smooth nd fast working with s pen and erase with finger is mind blowing no need to change eraser just use finger.....all in all superb app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Beats S-note when the note becomes long (minimal lag). Zoom lock works well when writing with the palm rested on the screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Jst love it.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I've seen better options out there"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Serious problem,part of note does note show in potrait mode if used to write in landscape mode vise visa. Add all s note features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Do give it a try"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Brush smoothing would be nice. The stroke looks a bit jittery in my opinion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So close to handwritten notes with the perk of digital organization. Just wish it had handwriting recognition like the native Note 2 apps. Would be a great option to search through notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"IMHO this app is WAY better than the S-Note app that is on my galaxy note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has more features than the built in spen note taking application. Fingertip eraser, adding photos into notes and most importantly automatic backup to Dropbox as a backup database and pdf. Big plus that the developers are very responsive to suggestions as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best, simplest handwriting tool out there. Doesn't come with the bells and whistles of SNote, but great if you just need some digital paper for a no fuss note taking session. Would recommend."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Especially being able to use a finger to erase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I used S note in place of actual paper notes for work. I have converted over to Papyrus. The app is simple to use in many of the ways that S note is a bit clunky. Also, the paid cloud services feature is great. No more one by one pdf conversions. I rely on my notes to write my daily reports. Being able to write, keep, and backup my notes with this simple but feature rich app is ideal for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app, would love to have a way to automatically export pdfs to sd card instead of the cloud."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than s note. Can include more templates"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app. Great for school!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I use it everyday at work as I write repair orders on cars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just Needs Widgets to be Perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"wonderful!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"On market"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"quill works better with a pen, freenote+ works better with pen, stylus and finger, sketchbook is better for drawing. For my speed of writing/sketching, any app that doesn't help filtering output from the occasional touch of the palm isn't very useful, and papyrus isn't very smart about it. looks good, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can we have the pop-up note/mini note so we can link it to GMD Spen when we use AOSP? This feature would be awesome, I see Simplest Note for Spen has done it, and I believe you guys can."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm never going back to S note ever again!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for taking my notes during class. Handwriting helps me retain so much more than typing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely LOVE THIS APp. Does everything I need without the need for pen abd paper. Nothing compares to writing your own notes w/ a pretty pen and pretty paper this is the solution, especially if you have the spen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not too long winded... Not too simple....."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like many things about this app. Finger erases, multiple page types, infinite note size, looks tons better than s-note, partial cloud compatability. Only thing more I could ask for is continuous sync between devices. It's kind of there with Dropbox sync, but evernote sync would be preferred for me. ALSO, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LET US CREATE NOTES OR NOTEBOOKS AS SHORTCUTS"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great program, I have my galaxy note since almost one year ago and I have never used a lot the s-pen, instead I used to take pictures of my hand done notes and to upload to my evernote account. However, now I prefer to make my notes directly in the papyrus and one finished to share to my evernote account. For me as a scientist is great to take note of my ideas wherever I have them. Thanks guys for this great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best option for handwritten notes.   Improvements can be made,  but pretty good overall"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for the Note 8.0"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use it almost everyday whenever thoughts spring up, and my phone always follow me so it's a must have app if u'r like me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is definitely something I'd spend money on, but only with widget support. If I could flip through my notes like a notebook on home screen it would be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It can't be 5 stars until we get widget support.  I still have to use S note. I want to see my notes on my home screens."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Like how I can export to evernote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good & versatile!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Great interaction w stylus even on an S3 mini. The main downside that prevents practical usability (aside from not being able to stretch my screen, lol) is that when I'm writing, my right resting knuckle hits the bottom buttons. If they absolutely have to be there, given the phone's smaller 4"" size, there should be a lock feature on the top to permit writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notes app for s-pen yet"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This application performs really well.  I love way it can distinguish between a pen touch versus a finger versus the bottom of the hand.    Hopefully in a future release hand writing recognition will be added."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I used this app for free online courses and bought all the premium for full experience. I can't wait to start school and use this app instead of physical notebook!  Also need feature to set zoom default value and and jump to specific page instead of clicking next.  This app great for all Note devices owners"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Itz a great app with so simple and super cool in note taking....Itz a must download app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I can't complain about its functionality. It's perfect. I would like to see fancier page template, such as ones with different background rather than the boring college rule paper. Even better if we can just define a background ourselves."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried many like apps and this one is by far the best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"As above."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just like paper!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Turns my note 10.1 into an unlimited notebook!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything is good and pretty smooth. But just wish it had a better visual effect to it, like notes mobile does. Because it doesn't excite you looking at it. It's not fun using it, because it's not very visually appealing.     Otherwise, I'd probably give it 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awsome work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I like the app, but when making diagrams I would really like to be able to snap to grid. Also, input is not quite as smooth as s-note in the note10.1. Those are my only complaints, I like the basic drawing toolbox and the fact that you can export to PDF ect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"HTC sensation. Package file invalid."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"really this is the best note app in the store it is  awesome,but it is need to add the following in the coming update 1- recording note  2-select color oof paper note b.regards"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excelente..funcional. ..buen look..!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"S-note barely compares to papyrus' smooth writing!  5 stars for now,  a pdf import would be sweet ;)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The app is fantastic!  I can't wait to see what comes next!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"i use this on my HTC Flyer and works splendidly. I can use the pen to write and use my fingers as the eraser. so cool! also i can use the highlight button on the HTC pen to crop and move my writing. awesome^^"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would love if it had a widget so I could note from my lock screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"please add Tag function for note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't say enough about how nice this app is.  Highly suggesting getting it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Paperlike drawing!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs a few more productivity elements/functionality and improved writing. Sometimes can be a little less fluid than the native spen apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simplest, cleanest."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Useful..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's very cool that you implemented all the top suggestions fro your users. It's a bit out of the ordinary to charge for an ything in a beta, but I'm not all that bummed about 3 bucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wish that there was a highlighter option though. :/"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Basic toolset is complete and very intuitive - an s-note upgrade in most regards.  The way this app syncs not only its database with Dropbox, but also PDF versions of them, is FANTASTIC!!  As that makes the notes in Dropbox easily accessible from anywhere you can get to Dropbox - NO ONE ELSE DOES THIS AS WELL!  So many thanks for that!  Add a few good widgets and the competition can just surrender.  However, I will deduct a star every time it harasses me to rate it (after purchasing and rating already) - simply because its the only thing I can do to resist the practice. Down to 3 from 5..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really handy!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Would give five stars If I had option to remove paper lines and just have white sheet of paper if I want to."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to put books within books"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much more than the creators charge."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Salimsha bekal"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app out there!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much more natural to use than s-note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can't believe I missed this app, a lot better than S-Note imo For me the dealbreaker is auto export to PDF dropbox Although I would like to choose dropbox folder, maybe a future feature?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for mixture of text and diagrams.  Excellent on Samsung Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love how it works with my samsung stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for note taking, and I have tested dozens. I love the way it handles infinite vertical scrolling and disabling back button. Great S Pen only mode for us stylus believers!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just needs option of single finger scroll and ability to jump to next note while viewing a  note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"More user friendly and more tied to the calendar and day planing would be nice."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Have tried many writing apps and this one works the best for journaling. I like being able to ct and paste from other documents and then comment with writing. Needs to add writing to digital text capability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Few missing tools but happy with what I got In the free Version"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love my Samsung Note tablet but this is the application I use far more than any other.  As an avid note taker and a believer in using less paper this a home run. You can't believe how many people ask me about this.  5 stars is not enough."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has easily replaced S-note app from Samsung. Great ui, seems natural with S-pen. Would love to  have the folder in notebook ability for better organization and maybe checkbox and bullet point function. Already 5 stars without those things. They would make it 6 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Pay to save to Dropbox? Yeah right..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Everything runs just fine although I would like to see handwriting recognition then it would be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just wish it had the ability to make an alarm to go with the notes. Other than that it is just what I wanted in a note taking app."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"fantastic note takeing tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Organization for ideas and outlines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it with a note and it's great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Reported a bug, got fixed in about a week."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"My daughter has been using Papyrus for some time now and I only see her drawing with it, she says ""Coloring is a hassle but the flow and everything else is fantastic. Though it would be better if the selection was like the lasso in photoshop and where the black lines stand out when you color over them."" I know Papyrus is for noting but as every father wants, i would love to see her happy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Still need to work on some aspect its not better than s note on my note 2..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks best note taking app for the Samsung note series"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it. You'll like it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got this app to be able to take notes and do physics problems in class. Was skeptical at first, but with a cheap stylus this all works better than I expected!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Helped me pass my real analysis class. My only qualm is that when you import the pdfs it produces to Inkscape, it just gives you a bunch of line segments of varying weights that you have to convert to objects and then Union before you can edit"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With its ability to distinguish between s pen and finger it learns the frustration of having to switch between own and eraser.   I just wish the s pen button could move the selected portions to resize and move it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The app is great.  I actually appreciate the in app purchases because I could really evaluate the app before paying.   The one feature I wish it had was saved pens. I often switch width and color to do underlining and then switch back. When I switch back I always get the size off by a bit so the text isn't a uniform width. Something where you could have saved pens like what S Note does would make this app a 5 star absolute best."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"When I first got my Note I was looking for a better app than s-note and s-memo.  I tried several products but none of them came close to Papyrus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"spen을 잘 설정해주면 아주 빠르게 색깔을 선택할 수 있고 지우는것도 아주 쉽다. 페이지 넘김도 더이상 빠를 수 없다. 간결하고 빠르고 직관적이며 쉬운 최고의 앱이다 차차 추가 기능들이 더 보완되면 더욱 좋을것"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For other galaxy note users: this is far easier to use and more practical than the snote app.   Scrolling down through the page.... If I could do that in snote they didn't bother to tell me.  Honestly just switch to this. You won't regret it.  Still good three months in:-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Gördüğüm en kullanışlı program"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for all arround notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Anche se (per ora) mancano alcune funzionalità é un'ottima applicazione per scrivere a mano libera e per prendere appunti é un must."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like the writing part and they have implemented some clever features which makes note taking faster than in other apps..   BUT BE WARNED this is a crippled app by default.  extra $3 to for a proper eraser or to use the keyboard in the app.  (and another extra) $3 to be able to export to your own dropbox.    That kinda ticks me off.  I get paying for a service, but paying to access your own services is just dinky. 3 stars for how I feel, belanced by a good tech, would have been 5 stars if it were just $3 to get a full payed app. :-P  not sure if I'm going to keep it (and pay) or use an alternate. not because it's bad tech, but because I don't like companies that cripple their stuff in stupid ways."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"the only thing missing is rotate selection. otherwise very good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its a really good application  Keep up the good work :D"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is just so perfect *-*"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Well implemented. Works very well with the Galaxy S pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, works perfect for me.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Goooooooooooood!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"sweet. Thank you for making this available for my device too. Nice app and fun to use :P"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very handy, could do with a few more shape tools tough, like color fill and being able to curve straight lines"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"While I'm not a fan of holding key features hostage until you pay up, I must admit that this is by far one of the best apps of it's category. Some minor quirks in the ui, but overall very much worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"New update supports smaller devices. Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best app for S pen!  Tq for this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Its a great app and works well,   ut until the Dev stops trying to rob us with that silly ""buy per feature""  it gets one star, he can get his other 4 when he released a pro version with ALL pro features."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"When I open the app and write a note at first, writing really lags. Then I insert a pic from folder or take a pic with the camera, then the lagging stops an everything works fine. Please look into this issue and fix it. ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This feature should be standard by now, sorely lacking for this app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I'm going back and forth between this app and LectureNotes. For me,  I dislike not being able to scroll notes with a finger stroke. As is,  I keep erasing notes instead of scrolling. If finger scroll was enabled,  this would be a 5 star program."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Still unusable because accidentally clicking the side button on s-pen erases the last stroke! Also, needs a widget."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks very helpful app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is what I was looking for my FZ-A1. The pen is very easy to use unlike the other 10 apps I tried."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the clean interface and smooth, low lag operation. I love the size of the canvas. It seems to remove a lot of the friction I've traditionally had with other apps.  Pdf exports seem to be SVG.  Files are clean, detailed and small. Sprawling note from work that would have easily been 5+MB in notability, was ~600KB.  Functional, nag-free app.   Thanks devs!  Will be spending some $ to support."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You need to specify minimum screen resolution in description. Not working with sgs"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome application"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Just sucks everything about it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is so beautiful. Well done on the holo ui implementation. It's a shame that I can't use it because it lacks the one feature I really want. I want to be able to have my words automatically shrunk and not have to keep scrolling the page when I run out of room. For reference, check out Free Note. They implement this beautifully. However Free Note's UI it's pretty awful. If this app adds that feature, they can have all my money. However, this app is still amazing. Great job."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I have karbonn a30 which have larger screen then note 2 and though this app don't work and give reason that I have small screen size"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tried other writing note taking apps, this one is as close to actually writing on paper. So many trees will be saved from me using them to write on."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love love love this app....Very user friendly...Much better than S Note..Really appreciate the swipe/erase feature. ..and much more...install immediately....you won't be disappointed. .."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exllent app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sad, because not for my 4"" phone..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has now replaced all my handwritten apps and actual/physical notebooks for school, work, as well as my personal journal. It is very responsive, when using my Note 2 S-Pen depending the amount of pressure used will reflect that in the saturation of the ink on the screen very true to actually handwriting with a paper and pen. I would like to see an update with a legal pad setting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"One star because I can't use the app.  There is a long lag between stroke and the appearance of the stroke on the screen.  Not sure why this is.... the bundled SuperNote app doesn't have this problem.  If a new version fixes the issue, I'll revisit the app and update the review."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Tried it out for a bit but uninstalled. For me it didn't beat S note enough to warrant a second note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"this is perfect app, i am using rubber stylus on nexus tab believe it or not awesome even with finger. small suggestion make the page as a full screen on double tap because my hand touches the back key button, so to avoid this on double taping make it full screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is exactly the app I've wanted to use my Galaxy Note 8 as my primary notebook at work. It is simple and fast. I like the simple menu system and finger touch erasing. I like Google Keep for little notes, todo, etc. but Papyrus is powerful enough to take the place of my trusty Marble cover 80 sheet 5x5 quad rule.  The pen+button gestures do not seem to work on the Note 8 yet, but the pen is pressure sensitive and the pen+app+screen work beautifully on the Note 8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Nice but not functional. On my nexus 7with a stylus it doesn't manage to keep up and the writing is illegible"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Ok types but better than google note"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"WoW!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"default page zoom.  add that small option and would be 5 stars!! auto zoom is 100% when you open notes, should allow to change it to our preference when we open notes or new pages."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Genial writing is good. Papyrus is great! You have four different graph paper designs and three ruled designs and blank paper settings. If you get the premium pack you can type and have shapes and line straightener. This is writing app the best I have been searching for something to fit my needs and this does 100%"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great great app :-) Thank you for giving the real feel of Notebook ..... Please give an option so that v can share these notes with friends. Sorry I found it ;-)  20 Stars <3"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Can get more better. .... nice work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've an objection... when'll you guys add widget support??????????"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app very much"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I just felt a little tricked, u have to pay for an upgrade for a ""true eraser"" and the ability to use shapes, good app, just give me a little more of an ""premium upgrade"" for $2.99, oh and its another $2.99 to use cloud services that are normally free. uninstalling lol"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As a note taking app Papyrus makes the cut because of its simplicity. I just love a) the separation of ""stylus to write"" and ""finger to erase"" b) Infinite paper in 2 dimensions and c) Two finger scroll and pan. Pity the premium functionality has been split, making you pay twice. I really think once is enough at that price."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This breaks barrier of free note taking in Android."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Granted the handwriting tool was lag free but no text tool in the free edition?? No widget?? Back to Handwrite Lite, I go."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thanks for papyrus it really is sup pen especially when used with s pen launcher."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fun"

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Doesn't even begin to compare With S Note. G Note or G Note 2 Owners you wont be impressed but AOSP guys You will love it. 5 stars for the efforts dev!:)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok go"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"awesome, better than s-note in some ways."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I want to be able to link the note to my calendar or attach the note once an event is added in the calendar as memo and not attachments. S Memo allows that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perhaps the best app in a very long time."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great on other devices. My phone is to small though.(lg Venice)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Goood"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best drawing/handwriting note taking app for me. Infinite paper size. Vector drawing. Drawings can be exported. Feature should be added: import image into the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Such a great app. The Cloud storage is awesome. :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks DEV......."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful. This app is fast and easy to use. Perfect for note taking."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Helping hand....."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app functionality is solid, and if you have a phone with a stylus like the note 2, it is a great way to expand the stylus based capabiliies of the device. But I actually have the droid RAZR m, which is not a stylus-based device device, making it absolutely impossible to write. This is not a bad app, but if you have a non-stylus phone this app really sucks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy S2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Later"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easier to use than native S note on Galaxy Note 2.  Pen width gets narrower on  last line of page in landscape mode.  Incredibly user friendly and simple to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Please fix the problem of low resolution. Its is not supported in my device its name is : sony xperia miro. Please check the resolution and fix it with a new update. Would be happy if problem is solved. Waiting for positive response."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"You should make the minimum screen resolution more noticeable."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Due to s note have function to insert picture and other cool function. I believe development team should replicate all function from s note but must come with an upgraded function to it for difference and better experience"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Cool stuff"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Simple is the best!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tait"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"sluggish"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pls add support for Samsung galaxy ace 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Stupid app i prefer s note and u should pay for tools that u can have for free with s note and it s not very smooth with my galaxy note.uninstalled the app.i gave u 3 stars to not be mean.and there is not even a widget for your app and if there will be it will cost money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very useful app :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Why the hack."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for my tablet, more rich in features and easier to use than Asus supernote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Send feedback is Absetd"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Device not supported"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Pen and writing feel so natural. Even fun to sketch with due to pressure sensitivity. Widgets would be nice but, definitely not a big drawback. Great job fellas! Cant wait for future updates!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not as good as the quick memo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Corrects the palm zoom annoyance in S-note.  Just needs the ability to import PDFs."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I needed something that I could take hand written notes with.  This fit the bill perfectly. It works great with my fingers in a pinch (no pun intended) but tomorrow I get my Samsung pen and make it even better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"So sad need to buy the packages to get full access. So im going to uninstall. Sorry."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Looks fantastic, unfortunately doesn't seem able to override default actions for pen button on Note 10.1 which puts it behind S Note for me."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"They have to compete with S-Notes and they do an excellent job of it.  The gesture delete makes this product so easy to use.  I have recommended to several friends who now use this.  Does not have every single feature that I would like but this is the type of developer I want to see succeed with DROID apps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Lags real bad on my Asus Infinity. Lecture notes is real smooth, and and is much more configurable. Do the comparison, and you'll see for yourself!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use the app every day and it is one of the best I have for work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Stunningly smooth, not glitchy when palm is touching, unlike the cringeworthy S-Note. I beg for addition of PDF importing to be supported so I can take notes on college course documents which is a feature that S-Note does have over this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"No typing from keypad without $"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love this app. But i miss import functions for example from snote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need to be able to do more shapes (ex: arrows). Still no widgets. Could improve performance as some lags on note2.  Otherwise great tool. best I've tried so far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need a way to edit text"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"As it stands this is a great note taking app, but missing a few things	This is my go-to note taking app and I love it. It takes notes in vector format so text and images can be easily chaged or moved.  A few things I would like to see is a widget, different colour highligher for colouring and highlighting, import pdf documents, evernote sync to name a few. But as it stands now, this is thebest note taking app I've come across so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app for galaxy note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My suggestion: palm rejection, better rendering and recognition"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Papyrus easily has the best user interface out of all the notetaking apps I've used to date on my ThinkPad Tablet. I've been a heavy OneNote user for years on my Windows machines, and Papyrus is the only thing on Android that can match its freedom of input.  From the point of view of a OneNote user, however, Papyrus still has its problems. First and foremost, it lacks search. Second, it only outputs PDF, JPG and PNG and imports nothing, so you can't switch between devices or collaborate with anyone who doesn't happen to own a pen-enabled Android tablet. Third, its palm rejection and zoom will join forces to make you lose your place in the note.  That said, Papyrus is a dream to use; it's design is leagues ahead of other pen-enabled notetaking apps, especially the dismal Android OneNote client. I only wish that Papyrus was a little more aware of the notetaking world around it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Missing only voice recorder and possibility of Archive books"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use but I wish there was a widget that launchs a clean new note.  Dropbox sync is amazing but I can't seem to get the ""partial erase"" to work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I searched around to find a good note taking app here and came accross papyrus. It fits me perfectly! Others are saying that it lacks features but I use this to take notes. I can export these to my computer or drop box. All in pdf too! It's great. Highly recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is THE best note taking app ever, I use it on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (GT-N8000) in school for maths and science, without it I would be totally lost. One thing to note though, sometimes when writing an lifting up die S-Pen, there appears to be a slight jagged edged stile end to the stroke which makes it hard to write neatly and fast. Still the best note taking app. I have watched this app develop from it's release date till now and must say, Steadfast Innovation, LLC are great developers. Enjoy your day. Enjoy Papyrus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very nice app especially for students when taking down notes or drawing mindmaps."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Used this for a bit, but the inability to add a new page at an arbitrary point in my notebook was a deal-breaker. Now using LectureNotes, which does that, and lets you split a page into 2, at a horizontal or vertical line.  (Still waaaay better than S Note.  S Note is highly integrated into the Samsung UI, which would be great if only S Note was any good...)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking application for galaxy note devices. Simple yet powerful enough for most business users."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Good snote replacement.....but one thing more..........if u people can also put the Opacity for the pencil colour like we get in wacom bamboo paper the smooth colouring ...then this will be the best for sure....please just add this feature ......."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"A potential application. I bought the extra features. Hiwever there is a lag in the rendering of characters on note 2 and not having single finger scrolling does not make it practical for taking log notes. Prefering better lecturenotes for my note 2."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is by far one of the best note taking apps I have used"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Marvelous quality!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"เกิดมาเพื่อ   SS NOTE"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note app ever. Goodbye ever note, hello papyrus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"เหมาะกับ stylus มาก"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm using Papyrus to take notes for during business meetings on a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 tablet. The pinch zoom, never-ending page, finger erase, dual finger scroll and auto-upload to Dropbox have me hooked. I have not found and cannot imagine a better writing application."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really, I have it and barely use anything else. Better for notes than S-Note.  It's vectorial, so you can resize and change line thickness without loosing quality. Lot's of user friendly features.  If you own a Galaxy Note, this is *the* app that makes it undoubtedly worth it.  Would pay for it if it wasn't free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Definitely a worthy SNote replacement for a rooted Note 2. Very intuitive and easy to use."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than snote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"1) it works with the s-pen 2) it takes pictures 3) it keeps your notes 4) it's free"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use Papyrus at work on my Note II for sketching out ideas, process blueprinting, and writing up mock tutorials. Since the latest update, I can import screen captures from other apps.  Probably the part about Papyrus that sets it apart from other note-taking apps is that you can create infinitely-sized notes simply by two-finger dragging the page to create new space. You have no idea how useful it is to not be restrained by page size when you're working on a small device.  Sometimes my note gets so large after working on it for a while and I start to see where things could be broken down into smaller parts. I would love to see a feature where you could break apart a single page into multiple pages based upon a selection."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Easy and very fast. Replaced any paper book of mine. With an s pen its a must have."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"First and only app I have yet found that properly works for taking handwritten notes. Directly supports Wacom-equipped Thinkpads and the pressure//eraser/buttons actually work as expected.  Tiny amount of pen>screen lag, but you get used to it in a minute or two. (and not unexpected as due to dev version of JB-4.22 running on ""new"" hardware)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like the true eraser tool, but it should be free with the app. Also, we need to be able to assign the true eraser to the button press on our stylus (right now, it can only be assigned to ""single-finger touch"". I can't recommend this app until that functionality is added. Lecture notes is a better choice at this moment."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Updated the review after receiving comments from the developer"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great now that you can import pics. Is there a way to bring objects up a layer or down behind another?  Eg. Push a pic behind some lines?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Causes my phone to freeze every time it's opened. Too buggy. Excellent when it works"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Doesn't lag anymore. Pdf import and ability to adjust stylus offset would be nice. My wacom stylus has a small offset and if I could just move it 5 pixels to the left when it writes it'd be perfect. Also if pages could load more smoothly that'd be awesome. Other than that good job!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"All bugs were fixed! Works smoothly now on galaxy note 10.1."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"There is a long lag between stroke and appearance on screen. The app is completely unusable as a result. Really surprised it is getting even mediocre reviews, total crap"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is really a great note taking app. Probably one of the very best out there. Easy and intuitive in its design and a very short learning curve (unlike S Note). My only ""gripe"" is having to spend $3 to purchase a text typing tool. Buying services perhaps, but buying tools?? Plus the text typing tool is buggy -no explanation of how to erase the text. ..?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With the new addition of the options to add pictures to the notes, this becomes the best note taking app. I have taken hundreds of pages of notes on this. The only option that I was waiting for was the option to add pictures to the notes. This app always gets better with every update."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my note app of choice - it is the closest thing to a perfect experience that I have found. There only a few things standing in the way of this app being ideal for my needs. It makes lecture notes viable even on the relatively small screen of the note 2. It looks like there is active development of the app, so it should keep getting better. A list of things I found to be nice/not nice: Awesome:  (1) Palm rejection  (2) Infinite page both down and to the side  (3) Can use fingers to resize/move while taking notes  (4) Pressure sensitive to S pen  (5) No tools on bottom of screen  in landscape mode  (6) Can add pictures into note page.    Not-yet-awesome:  (1) S pen side button does not work (not their fault)  (2) No single finger scrolling  (3) Scrolling takes a second to load different parts of a page  (4) Cloud services (in app purchase) does not yet have Google Drive.  (5) Can't save notes to SD card  (6) Writing does not seem as smooth as in S note (S note seems to do smoothing)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like Papyrus better than the one that came with my Galaxy Note II. As a writer, I wake up in the middle of the night with ideas. So instead of turning on lights and diving for my pen and paper before the details dissipate into thin air, I grab my phone, open Papyrus and jot away. It's awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been through all the apps for note taking on Galaxy Note and this is the winner. The ease with which one may write the pen and then select with the finger for moving or deleting is super practical. The new image import feature is also great. Next, it may be useful being able to shift object on top or behind other objects (can at present only be done by playing with cut/paste) Keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"...but crashes when importing a pic from picasa gallery. Also would like to see a widget for notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was lost after the broken Skitch v.2 came out, as I need to take snapshots and then comment, move things around, and write both freehand (for math), and typed text (for long comments).  Papyrus 0.5.1 is now even better than the previous version of Skitch."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect alternative to SNote"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"After I installed the Jelly Bean update I was lost without the S -Pen App. This App restored my appreciation for Android Open Source. Gotta love the developers!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Allow user to insert his own image makes this app so much more useful now. I probably would stop using Zbrush which seemed to have stopped updating its app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Still lags on tf700, drawing response is too slow :( It's great on the Note 2 though.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app for taking notes for personal and work use. Very responsive with plenty of options. First handwriting app that I've actually enjoyed using."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Developer really listen to what the users say and constantly improve the app, all the features that I asked for have come to realisation, super great app and support"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Page is too ""white"" . needs option to change the Paper type. the added options are a bit expensive .  But the current functions on the free Version Is great !"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Antipaper is better -   This is great for simple stuff, but scrolling the page is a PIA."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Tried almost everything else in the play store, and nothing comes close to this app in terms of quality. I take lot of handwritten notes, and I am quite particular about the stroke quality. This app is a pleasure to work with.   Just one request to the developer: Can you please add an option to lock the page zoom level, and also allow specifying pen strokes and page settings as default. I wouldn't buying paying. I already purchased some extensions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Image insert, marker, keyboard input,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"a) Export to PDF, JPEG, or PNG for viewing, editing, and sharing on other devices b) Pressure sensitive (S-pen) for fluid writing and hand drawings c) Use multiple tools at once -Draw with stylus -Select with stylus button -Erase with single-finger -Pan/Zoom with double-finger  d) Cut, copy, paste single or multiple selected markings  I use it for writing engineering/physics notes during lecture and I couldnt ask for anything more (we write about 6 pages of 8.5x11 notes in 1 hour lecture). I can quickly draw a design using freehand or line/box/circle tools, adjust thickness/color and add text. Holding the S-pen button, I can quickly select a component (one marking or a group of markings) and resize it and and change color, thickness, etc. Also while selected, you can CUT, COPY, DUPLICATE, and PASTE groups of markings, even between different notes. This amazing feature allows me to select an engineering problem and replicate into a new note, to start a new problem with a similar setup, to expand in detail on that problem, or even make several altered versions of one design with changing the original. This is also great in problem solving, for repeating symbols and equations"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"So much better than the Samsung note app, a must have for note users!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"best app it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish I could put pictures side by side and add captions like S-note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"there is option for side button to work as an eraser or selecting tool with Spen, but it doesn't work... waste of money...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the notebook workflow, the ability to have multiple pages in a note, the configurable page size. I love being able to both draw and type. I think the freemium model and prices work. I love being able to sync everything among my devices.  I'm confident my feature requests are already in the pipeline, as I imagine they are common desires.  My current problem with the app, though, which makes it hard to like it all the way, is that when I'm typing long notes, the app occasionally freezes when I hit the 'done' button and I lose everything I just typed. Only seems to happen with long notes with many lines of text, but that is a huge part of what I use the app for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.must for note 2 owners"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Maybe I'm doing it wrong, but the gestures don't work. That's the feature I was excited for. It should be written somewhere that that's the case."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wish it was completely free for all the features. Greedy developers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Is it possible to please update this with a legal pad option. The look of yellow lined paper is better. Otherwise great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The app is good, but I dislike that it asks you to pay for premium services/tools (to extend its functionality) when the app itself is still beta.  Really?  I think you are putting the cart before the horse.  Get the app out of beta and then I'll consider paying for it, as well as the extras."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please include a palm shield (like makenotes alpha for instance) so that users with capacitive pens can also use them properly!!! Beside that really great note taking app, I recommend it to everyone !!! (HP Touchpad 4.1.2)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Why does this app not appear in google play when searching for ""papyrus""?  This app  is stable and does what my other note-taking and drawing apps do, and it has a better workflow. Moving notes between notebooks is critical (curiously this isn't working now). Request: This is an aggressive one. Use html5 as an alternative native filetype. Using html5 would allow multiple devices and even users with non-tablet html5 editors to work on the same file."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Quick response, good alternative instead of skitch"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Using on my Asus Transformer TF101, and while I know it's old, I have used other handwriting apps (FreeNote) and they are much faster than this.  It is so bad, that a letter does not render until I have nearly finished it when I am writing at normal speed.  This makes it very difficult to write legibly, and to do so, I have to write very slowly.  There are not a lot of configuration options, so I tried making sure there was nothing else loading down the tablet, and I also tried three different styli.  Nothing seemed to help.  It's unfortunate, because I really like the interface, which is my main gripe with FreeNote, but it looks like for now that the devs chose form over function.  When this is optimized, I would consider installing it again.  The form is nice, the function needs work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It is missing an important feature: an ability to insert audio recording. A not-so-important feature that I would love to have is the ability to export notebook to OneNote. Many people use OneNote to take serious notes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than S note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Just love this app. Works well with my s pen, has everything I need and it's easy to use. This is a great replacement for s note if you have installed a custom ROM and you don't have it any more.  Only thing that is missing is a widget for quick notes, but I'm nitpicking with that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"5*"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Perfect notes and easy to back up to db (with $2 add-on). I only wish I could add attachments for class hand outs with each corresponding note..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The payware features are already in SNote...there's no homescreen wdiget...two huge shortcomings featurewise to get me to migrate from SNote.  If you're not on TouchWiz ROM, consider this a 4-5 star review....but if you already have SNote, it is more capable all around, and free.  To get this app closer to onpar with SNote, you're going to pay $5.  The above shortcomings have been on the Papyrus website wishlist for a hwhile and have yet to get implemented"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The idea of using finger for other functions is really great. And I like the unlimited page size."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ive downloaded and used snote, quill, lecture notes, pen supremacy, memo, evernote, but papyrus is by far the best note taking app. Its nofrills design is basic and to the point and it gets the job done WELL. Infinite page makes note taking and brainstorming a breeze!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you FOR FINALLY implementing true pen pressure!  This is the first app that I've seen get this RIGHT.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"I like this app but the features your asking to pay for are in S Note already. I'm willing to pay cause it's not some outrageous price but I think I will wait to see what more you will have to offer that's not in S Note already. Some drop shadows on text would be nice. At that point I will definitely give a five star cause I do believe it will be worth it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"works great on Note 2. would have been better it there was a to embed voice picture and video though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this app for note taking and jotting down ideas, so simple to use but effective, lovely UI, nice features without all the clutter and menu-scrolling of some apps. Best app I've used with my S-Pen! It just keeps getting better with every update!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my all time favorite note taking app... And if you have the s-pen,  you'll love it too.   No other note app comes close!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'm just not sure if multi screen is working on my 10.1 can't Seem to work it but very nice app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've used all of the other note taking apps available and preferred this one by a lot. Developers are extremely responsive to feedback. Application is amazing overall, but missing a few features here and there. The devs said they would consider adding in my suggestions."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"How do you get multiscreen on the new update for note 10.1?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"95% of what I was looking for, and great enhancemants in work. Easily the best note app out there."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally ditched my paper notebook"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the infinite scrolling. Love the finger scrolling and moving. I can barely scroll on S Note without killing myself. This is a truly enjoyable and intuitive experience. I love the tap to erase on my Note 10.1.  Thank you for making this app. The only gripe I have is that the infinite scrolling has a top-left limit. Please remove that if possible. Thanks! :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Glad to see this fixed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best ""non stock"" Apps (if not THE best) you can get for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2! I can honestly say that buying the premium options is definitely a no brainer if you own a Note 2! I'm not sure if the dev has a Note 2 or not, but either way he sure knows how to make an app for one! Thank you dev for this AWESOME app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Only getting better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This has everything I needed: Infinite white paper with support for moving strokes and text around. Perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the infinite paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I love the easability of using the button to select, the pen to write, and my finger to erase which is what samsung should do. But the in-app purchases need to be fixed. I backed the app up and my purchases were gone. I had to reinstall the app in order to get my purchases back. Other than that, add more features and this app wil be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"The combination of the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and the Papyrus app are very hard to beat. It makes recording ideas and notes on the fly so easy, and the ability to subsequently modify them makes it all that much better than paper. I've tried using other methods of recording hand written notes, but this is the first that is as effortless as paper, while offering all of the advantages of being digital."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried a few different apps but none work as well as this with the s pen. I prefer it to s note even though it lacks a few features"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"And fast and easy and intuitive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"...first, you have to get the cloud backup and shapes separately, second, bought the cloud backup and never received an update or anything, it still asks me to buy the premium options... nice one..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Instead of in-app purchases just provide upfront cost so people can choose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The note taking functionality of this app is great. I bought both of the upgrades, and they both worked great for several days. However, after 3 days, I am no longer able to connect to Dropbox, and it says the export failed. I'm not sure if it's an issue with my tablet, Papyrus, or Dropbox; but that was the most important feature, in my opinion."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"App is really good. Especially like the infinite page size it offers. However the writing experience could be further improved. When compared to other SPen applications, Papyrus seems to be a little less responsive which lead to a less pleasant writing experience. And this gets worse as I write more on the page. Hope this can be improved in the future releases."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Ok I like this app better than Lecture notes. I have the free version of lecture notes & I was going 2 buy the paid full version but y do tht when I can just have this. The 2 premium apps r only $2.99 & I am going 2 buy them. 4 me 2 purchase the premium apps its the same price if I paid 4 the Lecture Notes app. Works gr8 on my tablet & very essy 2 use & setup compared 2 the setup I did on the Lecture Notes app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"The extra features should not be an in app purchase.   I can understand games but most people don't backup or they upgrade causing your purchase to disappear.   Don't punish honest people."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works awesome! Couldn't ask for a better quick note taking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"But I can't find out, because of how laggy it is."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for note taking .. love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Nice writing...finally been looking for this for long time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very purpose built for just note taking, but that is exactly what I needed. Love the ideas to change page size (A3,A4 etc.) and turn zoom on/off. Makes it even more realistic as pen and paper. Handwriting is superb, and I would say a bit better than S-Note! Usability is five stars, but would like to see more colour options for the paper and for notebooks in home page. Also a shame it's not compatible with multiscreen, but that problem is everywhere :(. Still look forward to using this app at university!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"App itself is great nicely presented and works well. I bought the paid upgrade then reflashed my phone now I no longer have the upgrade and I cannot even buy them again as the Play store says I already have them. I have emailed the developer and so far have not had a reply. Great app but be cautious paying out for the extra features until this issue is ""fixed"". Gets a 3 from me until then.  Have since been contacted by Dev. To restore purchases. Go to premium features then click menu > Purchase history > restore purchase. Have updated my rating to 5."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"What could possibly make this better?  ...The ability for a cloud based hand writing recognition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Thank you for allowing the user to export to JPG. I nowuse this feature to export to Evernote. Evernote will OCR my handwritten messages and now become searchable. Awesome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Of all the note apps that I've tried, Papyrus Beta has the most natural interface for my tastes.  Accessing and changing tools and changing basic pen settings are quick because there are  minimal steps to navigate features.  Unfortunately, there is noticeable delay between my stylus input and the appearance of writing strokes.  I don't notice the delay in Quill or Samsung SNote, but I spend time waiting for Papyrus Beta to to register pen strokes.  Though the awesome interface is worth money, I'm reluctant to spend $10 to unlock features if the most basic need, quick and smooth stylus input, is not met.  Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I can't use this on my 4.5"" S2 LTE, because the screen is too small. However, the devs responded to my email quickly. The customer support is good, and from my usage on the GN, I like the app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Says my device has too low resolution? Come on!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Create notebook.Write notes.Organise notes. Simple but elegant Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome notetaking app. Straight to the point and easy to use. Uses two finger scroll so you can rest your wrist on the screen without the page messing up. I use it on the galaxy note 10.1 and it is a great alternative to S-note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Best app for taking notes on the market! I would give it 5/5 if it could batch import PDFs. As a student writting notes on PDFs is absooutely essential! Hopefully this feature will be available in the future. Otherwise greatapp!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app but not perfect.  First is the pen button doesnt seem to flip options from write to erase. (Not sure why) Also I would love a feature where it always went to a blank page on open. So a shortcut gesture would bring me strait to a new note writing page. Best would be a pop up shortcut. I would even pay for full for this feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use a CyanogenMod based ROM with no SPen functionalities, and this apps was a gift from the Heaven. Now I get back some SPen gestures while taking Notes. 5 stars no question."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks devs for creating this app. Truly “noteworthy"" and it has amazing quality. I would definitely recommend this application to every note user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have no idea how this app got on my phone but im in LOVE! I used it for the first time yesterday and i couldn't be more elated with the simplistic interface. It definitely brings out the potential im now taking of advantage of with my phone. Thank you so much!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"You should use this usefull app. I am using on Galaxy Note and it works perfectly."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Best app to replace paper minus a few bug(to be expected Since it still in beta)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool app and free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Exactly what I was looking for, so much better than Samsung's SNote app.  Feels like using OneNote on a tablet PC.  Dropbox syncing is awesome.  My only gripe is that there are two in-app purchases: one to unlock cloud syncing, and one to unlock some extra note taking tools...  I'm perfectly happy to pay a few bucks to unlock the premium version, but making different features separate IAP feels like they are nickel and diming. Great app overall, though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"It doesnt support the note 2 s pen..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Good start but input is way too slow on my Transformer Infinity."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"II HAD TO TYPE THIS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE I FINALLY FOUND WHAT I NEEDED!! A GREAT NOTEBOOK-ESK APP THAT LETS ME CREATE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF NOTEBOOKS AND I CAN EVEN CONTROL THE LENGTH OGRE THE PAPER!!! IF YOU HAVANA A TABLET WITH A STYLIST CHECK THIS ONE OUT!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"3 dollars for a working eraser?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Especially if you are rocking an s-pen.  i love everything about it.  my one sugestion is that i wish there was some kind of widget. Something you could actually jot a guick note on, on your home screen. Or just the ability to display a note as a reminder."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best app for a Galaxy Note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app for note taking. Very good stylus response without lag and fantastic pressure sensitivity with the Galaxy Note wacom stylus. Customer support is excellent with very prompt responses to queries and issues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for hand writing. Syncs with ever note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Intuitive controls, fluid movements. This is a very well done app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than S note for Samsung.  To erase, use your finger which is easy.  To write, use the stylus. The necessities are there and they are free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"By far the best app for Samsung note 10.1 I have come across. Better than real paper & pen, and much much better than Samsung S Note. You can erase elegantly, mark and move text and doodles around, and you can save your notes in the cloud. Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app. Shapes are awesome addition. Unfortunately every new feature is another in-app purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I think It is important to support talents! And Your app is great i take notes every day at The college"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Galaxy Note, and use its S-pen. I needed a note taking app that works on book/page model, has infinite zoom and is easy to use.   This is the best for free capturing of ideas.  I LOVE the ability to automatically erase with my finger. UPDATE: just bought the tool pack, OMG can I can now delete part lines, add shapes, type AND copy/resize anything - a big well done!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic, just what I was looking for. Great for school and work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Another in app purchase... I'd pay 5 bucks at once, not paying 3 bucks everytime I upgrade.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Far superior to s note in writing feel, accuracy and ease of interface"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Forget the in app purchases for tools.  If i buy an app i want to make sure i get all the pay features now and in future updates.  Also don't hide behind a beta tag."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I must pay twice to get te full features from the premium pack, lol very clever. The developers make the app free but too get some basic features like a proper eraser tool we must pay. If every new feature is 2.39€, wen this app is no more a beta app is the most expensive app of the Google play. Chame on you Developers"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Thanks but no. Get real, guys. Add local backup to sdcard, and I'll consider buying extra options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"I just payed for the premium with cloud Service and thought that After paying i will be allowed for additional functions. This is the reason why i paid for this App!! But whats now?! I have to pay AGAIN to get the new functions for example shape functions?! Sry, but i feel me screwed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Like others have said, in order to get what I would consider proper functionality out of this app you have to spend money. Might as well just make the app paid. Also its still in beta so why have to pay for anything that's still in testing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Sorry my phone already comes with better alternatives that doesn't require additional fees."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"We finally get a real eraser and it costs an in-app purchase?  No thanks, this app has gone to crap over stupid premium updates.  Go with Memo, it's free and open and doesn't try to lock you into stupid purchase-only features.  Uninstalled and good riddance!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I wish there is away to backup the notes,  or atleast another paid version available in play store as stand alone product,  i never and will never pay through in app purchase."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a sweet little app with just enough features to let you draw/sketch but stay out of your way. I'm now using this instead of SNote.  Thanks!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"What's lacking is proper backup. Created some test notes. Un-installed the app. Install the app again and the notes are gone. Can't seem to find anything in the SD card that I can backup. Someone is bound to use it to store their notes forgetting this is beta and if their device were to hiccup... I know you have cloud in the near future but please provide alternate backup solution and then I'll give 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I just jotted a talk today with this. It works great. If only we can type in too and paste images it would be perfect! Predefined pens would also be great, but optionl though."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus is an application designed to do but one thing, and do it well: handwritten notes. It uses pressure-sensitive strokes within its own pen-nib framework (NOT using the common S-Pen palette) and stores the strokes in a vector format(‼) so filesizes are incredibly small, even to hundreds of pages per notebook. It doesn't do anything beyond handwritten notes, and users should not consider it a replacement to or competitor of S-Note/S-Memo or comparable all-in-one apps, but rather as a complement to a notation suite. Also, and crucially, this app is free and totally uninfected by ads or crippled features, the single upsell-scheme a discreet Settings mention for cloud-storage integration (and should the ad push ever become more obtrusive I will retract my rating). This is an outstanding application for those with pen devices."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"looked so promising, I'm sure this is THE app to use"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app works great.  Only thing that woukd make it better is smoother lines when writing.  Works great with thr s-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I use this as my primary app for S-Pen note taking, and while I'd love Dropbox backups, I just can't see that being worth the premium cost when there's free alternatives. If it were 99 cents, I'd pay in a heartbeat."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"it would be really useful to change paper bkg color. including dark interface to not stress eyes at night."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love the simple elegance of this app. Smooth, intuitive, powerful,the speed with which handwriting is captured feels very natural, better than S note, which feels a bit clunky in comparison. I only wish I could import pictures, to move, scale, and mark up. If that functionality got added, that would make this rock. I'd pay for that."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If new update brings pdf import it would be 5 stars!!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I flashed a custom ROM, and at first I was afraid I would lose use of my s-pen, but this app is pure gold."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"S. Note has more features, functions, and is better for drawing, wished for several pen tools, moreso than the basics."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Too many good things to say about this app. A Must Have if you're on a galaxy note 10.1 tablet. Simple, beautiful, intuitive tool. Should strictly be a 4 because cannot insert photo /  image, cannot set book covers or your own / extra paper types but in terms of pure usability it leaves the other contenders in the dust, given that this is a BETA! Look forward to future releases."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"So you want to erase a small area, eh? You select the eraser tool and choose a small mm size... and then try to erase a small area. What happens!?? O.o .......... it doesn't erase a small area. Instead, it removes the full-stroke of what you wrote/drew. So, there's no such thing as erasing ""just what you want"" ......... the app choose ""for you""......... very buggy and annoying, needs a fix."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I purchased the galaxy note 10.1 in order to have any easy way to read pdfs on the go. At first the stylus was a bust because S Note doesn't have the capabilities to make digital documents the size of 8.5X11.   Papyrus allows you to select the size of your document and save it as a pdf to Google drive or drop box. Also, the gestures make taking notes on-screen fast and easy.   Papyrus should come standard on any tablet with a stylus."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app so far, this one proves that less is so much more... one request though please give the option to save pdf to memory instead of having to share it."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried many note taking programs and this is by far one of the best. It is easy to use, tracks Your Handwriting quickly and accurately. A solid app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is very simple and easy to use. I have a Galaxy note 10.1 and I found it easier to use this app rather than s notes. The nice thing about this app is that its free,there are not many good apps out there that works very good like this one with s pen. What I expext from this app in future is to have a seperate  ""to do list "" section and speak to text section."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thanks guys! This app is way better than S Note, and is making me love my Note II. The settings for the primary button on the S pen don't seem to work, however (for instance, if I set the button to use the eraser when I press it, it remains on the selector tool). Hopefully some issues like this can be resolved in the future. To people wondering about the finger erasing a whole line, try to make the eraser smaller. This seems to make the raser more precise and not get rid of entire lines."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I heated my note before this app. Must have if you have a note. Thanks so much for well thought of app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is clean and highly useful for college.. If you have ever note installed,  it will shoot your notes straight over.. A quick preview of your notes at a set percent zoom would make this perfect.. But for the wonderful and highly useful app, 5 stars. I would like the option to quick preview as I am using this to work calculus and physics and these problems can span across the entire page and loosing you place sucks."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"One of the best s pen apps out there.  I would recommend this product. I would buy this,  shocked is still free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best pne so far!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app beats the Samsung S-Note app hands down.  It's simple,  intuitive,  and has just the features I was looking for in a note taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"On the Samsung Galaxy Note it's let down by the lack of text recognition. It uses the s-pen, but no OCR.   S-Note is better."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent app, still needs work but it is very useful as is now."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Use it! You won't be sorry"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Called a beta, but is extremely polished. Love the infinitley sized sheet, which sets this app apart from competitors.  Great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its really good app, very prospective!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"So far so good but I can't believe that you have to pay AU$3 for a ""true eraser"". The current eraser erases the whole block instead of single strokes. So frustrating. Dev doesn't seem to respond to emails either. So close to the perfect note taking app on my galaxy note 10.1!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it a lot..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Papyrus has been my most used app on my Galaxy Note since it hit the Play Store. The devs are very responsive to feedback as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best App For Note2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't even know where to begin. This is by far the best note taking application I have used. I have FreeNote and S-Note and all of those other applications but this application is a blast to use. Its smooth. It allows you to send your notes to someone else via PDF which is great. I like that it senses the difference between your finger and the stylus. You use your finger to erase and your pen to write. No longer do you have to select the eraser option from the toolbox like in S-Note. Overall a good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This program is awesome. No lag when writing with s-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This APP is great and quite reliable on The HTC-One-S phone (HTC has a 1.6 GHz. 2-core). My only difficulty has been the lateral sheet navigation ( when sheet is huge compared to the small portion which is shown on the display). Instead of using 2-fingers, a possible alternative, is to introduce a LABS-type pop-up buttons .... when stickyFinger touches the extreme Left edge or Right edge of display, about 85% down towards the bottom edge. When the LABS button menu pops-up, user can toggle between ""simple stylus navigation"" or ""writing mode"". Then, navigation can be done easily with one finger or simply using the passive Stylus pointer. An alternative might also be to add the toggle setting (mentioned above) to the parameters menu ( existing... 3-dot menu) as a 6th item in the list. Thanks for this great App ;"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Out of all apps for writing, definitely the most promising and welcoming. Needs to add drop box/evernote/drive support, support editing PDFs (maybe already possible?), and addition of pictures. Could totally kill ever note on the tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Dream app! But please make use of single finger for panning and two fingers for zooming. All other apps use one finger and it's so hard to remember about it here. Usually I notice my error when I erease some notes and have to undo. But also happened to me to detect greased parts after closing... that was too late for recovery."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is totally awesome and the ability to erase things with a finger touch is super convenient.  There is just a single problem -- there is no view mode, so I cannot scroll and read my own notes fast. Scrolling far with two fingers is inconvenient and if you accidentally erase half of your note and click back button you just lose your data :(  The ability to insert pictures from the camera would be really helpful, too. This is the only reason why I keep using s memo for lab notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is simpler but seems more powerful and customisable than the default Samsung app S Memo. Most notable is the app can make a distinction between finger and pen, simple lined paper background among others, and infinite paper size which is super useful. There are options around what the single finger action does and what the pen button does, but this needs to be expanded to allow more customisation. Also pen button is not fully working as expected in this app. Another interesting difference from S Memo is the drawings are stored as vector instead of bitmap."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Much better than s-note on my galaxy note 10.1. Great app but there are still a few bugs. Really looking forward to the finished product!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Ok,but better if there is a typing opt. that's what almost every app  like this one lacks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Greeat app for spen. Allowes a very wide range of actions!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's amazing to think that this is only a beta version. I installed this on the note with gingerbread and it ran well, but running ics its incredible. Would definitely recommend"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"A brilliant which, with a few updates, could be the the best. i use it all the time and if entire lines didn't get deleted when erasing, folder organising was a little better and I could add images this would be a 5 star"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"These guys rule the universe!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"to, the respected developers, I have never seen a lovlier app on galaxy note.  thank you!! works like a charm!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very responsive and neat. Easy to use. But missing just one key feature for me. Cannot import screenshots or pictures at all"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best Notetaking app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"GREAT app. One of the best note apps out there that allows you to write in your own handwriting. Almost comparable to NoteShelf for iPad. Needs more exporting options (gallery, EverNote, email as jpg/in-line). Also could use a Diary/Calendar view to see notes made on specific days, and would love to see the ability to import graphics like transparent png's to use in notes. Biggest gripe: not compatible with my Droid Incredible 2... What gives?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Perfect but is missing Widgets"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I bought a lot of note app. But now I'm usng papyrus app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app beats smemo on the note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just wanted to share my thoughts. I have several note apps such as AK Notepad, color notes, notes everything, catch, free note, hand write pro and jotter plus galaxy note's own apps. This one is the most practical and responsive one.  Besides the dev is very supportive and very quick in replying to my emails almost instantaneously. Very Highly recommended."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Keep up the good job guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a great beta app. There are no good stylus note taking apps out there. Once this gets up and full version, it will be one of the best note apps out there. 5 stars to raise popularity and support dev"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"EXCELLENT app ! wayyy better than S memo or S note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Awesome. Just what I needed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fast and very intuitive to use. Fantastic! I love this app! Love the eraser function with fingers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really well designed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the first time I rate an app. This excellent app, really helps me alot during my work that needs lots of handwriting in the field. Instead of bringing a bunch of paper, all i need just my g.note 10.1.  This app really does what it says, go beyond paper. Very easy to use for writing, erasing, storing and sharing a note. Cant wait for more advanced features...."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Better than money."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Am using this app with my ssmsung galaxy 10.1"".  Love it. Highly recommendable!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Equivalent to iOS's neu.Notes app in both interface and responsiveness. Superior in terms of organizational features."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very quick and easy to use. Can share with ever note,but sadly only as a PDF. Would also like handwriting recognition."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Strokes are very precise, UI is great, all menu items are positioned perfectly. Keep it up!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"1) Best app of it's kind. Including S Memo. Honorable mention to Memo by Nathan Garside. 2) Can I haz option to open directly into a new memo? 3) Can I haz inverted colors 4) Please keep permissions minimal in future releases  FTR I almost never give 5 star ratings"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than the stock ones provided by samsung. Truly amazing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"very impressive app, first one I've used that truly shows the potential of the S-Pen.  keep up the good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I really like the setup. Would love to use to take notes in class. How far are we from handwriting recognition?  ie write to type!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app is a great note taking app. One feature I would like to see though is pressure sensitive writing without an active pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for. Does everything you want in a note app, and its free."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best one"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I had stopped using the S Pen on my Galaxy Note until I found your app!  Combined with the fatter stylus, I now basically have an electronic Moleskin!  I set the size to 4x6 index cards and its perfect for writing one item per card for my GTD capture.  Two features that would make this 5 star.   1) Default share preference for one-click sharing, could be the same email address / subject equal to name of the note. 2) fit-to-page zoom option that can be set as a default"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Seems as if your writing on real paper, especially the abillity to use the Spen on the note 10.1!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It is the first handwriting application which is actually works and easy to use. The infinite space on the page is a very good feature. Would be nice to have: when you open saved page it is better to find the minimal rectangle that fits all curves/writing and make it visible to whole screen by adjusting page position and scaling. This way you can actually see whole note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Please put in a way to go directly to the last page of a notebook when you open it.  Otherwise this app is exactly what I needed for my work notetaking.  Great work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"can we use any other  thing to write other than the S pen and our fingers? Galaxy Tab 2"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"really wanted this to work out. great feature set and the tutorial got me really hopeful. but WAY too much lag behind writing on a transformer infinity and adonit jot. too bad. sigh, the search continues."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I really like it. It works really well with galaxy note 10.1. I recently attended research conference . While others are writing on papers, i could write and draw everything with colors. Especially, i like finger eraser fuction."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have just installed this app and I am loving it. There is nothing like it. It makes the Note a Note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect! Some quirkiness but all-in-all, this is the most useful app I have downloaded. I love the ability to hand-write my grocery lists, to do lists, etc."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't really leave reviews but on my samsung note this app makes it amazing to use the spen with! I love it! I would totally donate to the continuation of this app! Awesome job guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This apparently is so awesome! A couple suggestions: 1. Pen pressure sensitivity is great, but there should be an option to turn it off. 2. Should be an option for the infinite paper size mode to only move horizontally or vertically, like a true scroll of papyrus! 3. Eraser should be customizable to erase only what it's drawn on instead of the entire stroke."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It could use a few more configuration options and the ability to import images, but it's a very good app for note taking. So far I actually prefer it over the S-note application which comes with the tablet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use, with simple, efficient UI."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wow! Love the fluid interface, especially the select/move/delete options. Would like to see zooming without checkerboard (at least on the non infinite sized pages). In the future would also love camera/microphone integration for the full note taking experience."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Full time aviation college student and this replaced my notebooks for all types of gen ed courses to aerodynamics ...flight physiology...wewther...etc. its great for all classes"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Wow! Impressive app. Feedback, clean UI, lots of features. Well done!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity! But this app needs a widget! So I can always see my a last note! Also needs a shortcut for ""new note"", on home screen! Two clicks is one too many."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love Papyrus and use it all the time"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the accuracy with the s pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"If you are looking for something that you can actually use with the intention of printing this is a great app. Would give it a five if it had more backgrounds from which to choose."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Excellent note taking software. It will be more benefit if there is  image insertion option."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does more than the paid 'note oriented' drawing apps do. And this one is free. Very stable for being in beta."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I been using drawing apps for diagramming and design extensively on my iPad (Notes Plus was the fav and also tried Noteshelf, SketchPad HD, Penultimate and a few others).  After getting my Nexus 7, I wanted to get rid of the iPad.  The deal breaker was losing out on the quality drawing experience, so I was delighted to discover Papyrus!  It is simply night and day better than all of them due to sheer ease of use and power within a simple UI... and at version 0.2.1 this is remarkable.  I've tried other Android drawing apps and naturally didn't find anything close.  So, I use it day in and out and it hasn't failed.  I'm very excited for new features as they are released (looking forward to resizing selected objects, text boxes, etc.) and hoping it keeps to the same elegant usability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Quite good"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool and very useful."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Dark theme would be great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'll echo a previous comment by saying that for those of us who are flashing alternative ROMS this app is by far one of the best S pen apps. Thanks for your obvious hard work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add a modifiable widget to this app. Its the only thing that keeps me from using it all the time. Would be more then happy to pay for this product. Much better than S-Memo or Jotter."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow, great update. Especially the option to disable 2 finger zoom is great since I now can rest my hand on the screen without worrying about the zoom settings (kept messing up my zoom settings if hand was faster than pen on my screen). A backup function would be great, but it will hopefully come very soon. Finally it replaced Lecture Notes on my Tablet. The fifth star is because of the very fast responses of the devs to my questions! Definitely recommed this app for everyone who has a tablet/phone with a stylus"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Really good s-memo / note replacement app for samsung users who are on aosp-based roms. And this is still in beta!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Worth checking out"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works fantastically, if I touch only with my finger the eraser appears, but when I touch with the S-Pen, the pen appears.  When I touch with both, it ignores my hand and only registers the S-Pen.  True palm rejection!  Fantastic."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its nice interface and functionality makes it the best writing app on a.market"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"My only gripe was that I can't load up other images to scribble on. Got a reply back on my feedback and they say it's in the works. :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great replacement for S Memo on custom roms for galaxy not."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Try to update but after download it says invalid package"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Just missing a picture insert, backup and sync option. Going by the rumors, it is on its way. Definitely recommended for all in need of a notes app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add possibility to paste pictures and that's all I need."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Owsome!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application out performs any other pen centric application. The simplicity in this app is outstanding."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I'm looking for!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This seems to have a great future what I would like to see in this program is being able to send as a text message and also some other programs let you write in one box and it gets sent to the line you are writing in so its formatted correctly in stead of having to write so small so you can fit to screen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is SO useful. I use it almost everyday with my Galaxy Note. Forget carrying around a pad of paper and pen. This is the perfect tool for notetaking.  Thank you developers for making my life easier."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has the nicest ink of any writing app.  I would love more options for indexing pages, mixing text and script, and importing pdfs, but the key, basic inking is wonderful.  Keep up the great work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great and fast application in taking notes. Wishlists: 1. offline/online backup 2. smooth two finger scroll. 3. widget  4. organized thumbnail 5. Tool Menu must be at the top. not bottom."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic replacement for S Memo. Should be included on Note II."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"amazing app for writing down something. (HTC Flyer w/ Honeycomb)  if you add two more functions -load pdf file and make annotation like this -more options for eraser  then i'll pay like twenty bucks for this app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This would be a much better app if it had palm recogniton. Itsp near impossible to use fir note taking without it, unless its a quick  note. Add that and easily 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app for drawing simple diagrams and storing them for later. Pretty simple layout. Only gripe is that what's drawn on the screen doesn't necessarily correspond to where the s-pen is; for me, what's drawn is a couple millimeters northeast of where I placed the pen. Tested on a flat surface looking straight down, same results. Still, quite a good app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the UI for organizing the notes. I'm not trying to be Picasso or use it to seriously just make quick notes and for that this is better than stock Samsung apps.... Really impressed, great application might be great for more serious drawing but that's not my thing"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love this.. it's simple, but useful. It's like a balance between antipaper and lecturenotes.. just wish I saw it before I bought lecturenotes just the day before.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have tried probably all of them, and this one by far has the best interface and most usability."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The only note taking I needed."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Please add palm free option. This app works great with s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just the writing app I wanted. Works great on the Samsung Note 10.1."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I like it's clean look and style. Works very well in my Nexus 7."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I got my Galaxy Note 10.1 and have been looking around for good handwriting applications. This does what I want and nothing more, nothing less. It stores writing as vector graphics which is nice for resizing things, supports pressure sensitivity, allows erasing with finger touch and writing with stylus. Has notebooks and notes for organization, pretty standard. Exports to PDF. What more do you need?  The only thing I would like would be to have support for buttons on pens to use as an eraser but using my finger is intuitive enough. And maybe customizable spaced lines (I'd like something half the size of the narrowest line spacing to line up my letters better, like AntiPaper Notes has)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Other apps like this are glitchy this isnt! :-) thanks to the makers of this one :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"None of the fancy features of the S-Note, yet easier to use (for my purpose). I could imagine a number of improvements such as were already mentioned in previous ratings."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Was thinking that I would have to write something similar for my galaxy note 10.1 but this does nearly everthing I want. The main exception is svg export."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was LOOKING FOR"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Now i can have note...!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have spent about 30 dollars testing out all of the other note taking apps out there and this one blows them all out of the water!  It works awesome with the galaxy note 10.1.  I look forward to the future functionality that he has coming!  AWESOME!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"this app is going to breathe new life into my HTC Flyer with Active Pen! Love the features so far. Looking forward to even more."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app! Would be awesome if it had a handwriting-to-text function."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"phenomenal! looking forward to the final version!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is still a beta.  An impressive beta.  A useable beta.  But beta nonetheless.  What it offers is a clean interface and a good inking experience.    What sets it apart from other note apps is the great support for active pens.  The availability of customizable gestures is fantastic.  Palm recognition is good.  The finger navigation works reliably, unlike other note apps like Quill.  All the below notwithstanding, this is the best note taking app on the market.  What I'd love to see (and pay for) in subsequent versions:  - Sync with other devices.  Not just export PDFs to dropbox, but have up-to-date editable notebooks available on both my phone and tablet (and desktop -- one day?)  - Hi-lighters  - The ability to reorganize notebook order on the home screen.  Right now they're just chronological.  - Better eraser.  Now it's a fixed number of pixels, regardless of zoom.  Would rather have it scale, to erase fine strokes more easily.  - Ability to adjust ink stroke properties (e.g. color) after it's on paper.  - ""Handwriting mode"" (option to get rid of pressure sensitivity.  Important for drawing, less so for writing.)  - Over-rule auto screen timeout."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very comfortable and fast!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is fantastic since I use custom from CM9, will continue and recommend for all Galaxy Note users even into CM10"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs to be able to resize text like freenote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Better than the S Pen app.  Only big missing feature is the ability to import a pdf or image to mark on.  Add that and it's 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried about a dozen handwriting apps on my Xoom and Nexus 7 and this one is on top of my list. I've been using Papyrus with a passive stylus and the results are just as good as what I could get with Antipaper Notes, my 2nd favorite handwriting app. Papyrus is easy to use and all commands/options are conveniently located while you write. I particularly like the gestures that allow you to zoom in/out ad span the page while you write. I look forward to the final version!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love papyrus, it does what S memo / note cannot: use vectors.  If you annotate a picture with S memo and then send it to somebody, they get a nasty surprise as all is pixelated. S memo / S note uses pixels and uses a pretty low resolution, nothing you can ever scale up without it looking really ugly. Papyrus on the other hand uses vectors, which are infinite scalable, you can print it out real big and it won't look ugly. You can also zoom in and out and scroll to make the note bigger in all directions. I use this on the Galaxy Note and love the precision it has with the stylus. Now just please add the annotation feature and I will be forever happy ;-) As this is a beta and it works really well and it is free, I will give this 5 stars. If the annotation feature makes it, I will even buy the app. Keep up the good work guys!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Has pressure sensitivity on cm9 with galaxy note and supports button on pen!  Please add png export"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works really great on Note 10.1. Especially the writing itself is much more responsive than on S Note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for in a note taking pad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"Not support on my sgs3"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nothing comes close. Could do with a widget for instant new notes though. Galaxy note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"With its support of S-Pen, this is the best sketching app for Galaxy Note, for sure. only 2 requests at this moment: please add text support, and make the configurable folder for storing the working files for easy sync with clouds (or integrate the cloud upload into the app!)  Good work!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"On my Note, most of the features are not available. I really like the unlimited page size and the one tap erase and am hoping the next update will install the ability to delete memos and give me a few of the tools. At present all I can do is write the most basic notes that I cannot delete or modify in any way. Back to S Memo for now. I will not trash this app as it has terrific potential. I just won't use it, yet."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is better than all the other handwriting apps I tried, and the interface is a big part of that. Clean and intuitive--don't ever be tempted to mess with it!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Overall this is a very good application. The only thing I don't like about it is that you cannot add images to the notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app falls into place for me. I used to make notes on scraps of paper and in the end i threw them out or lost them. With papyrus i can keep digital notes as naturally as i might on paper using a pen. This app alone will transform the tab with the s-pen. I would like to see a couple things improved such as navigation in existing notes, but i still rated the app as a five because the developer is genuinely responsive to user suggestions. Great app, thanks, Missentra"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"great tool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",1,"My screen is too big to support papyrus . Sort this please I'd love to use . Ta ."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Perfect for jotting down and organizing ideas. The drawing is smooth and predictable, it's fast and efficient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its awesome waaayyy better than all the other apps for natural note taking"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is just simply an amazing tool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Not really so bad  :-)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great on ThinkPad"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Emailed dev about supporting other dpis and bam supported . Great app for galaxy note users"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"It's great! But how can I let my screen to be on all time while papyrus running?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Can you add any type of sync like s note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Looks like it's going to be a great option for Samsung Galaxy Note users, a especially those who opt for another Rom like CM9.   It is really good guys...look forward to seeing what is next..will gladly support your final version ($)   Perhaps you should consider a dedicated drawing component (like sketch book) as well... That would be SMOKING COOL!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"After reading up on the app before installing this seemed just what I had been looking for. I recently bought an Alu Pen for my tablet and it's fantastic. This app has all the bells and whistles to really feel anywhere close to a notebook but, your tracking on a stylus couldn't be any worse.  It's the worse of every app I have tried, text looks jaggedy and horrid, I can't write using this, such a shame, the app is amazing but the core tracking makes my text look I'm retarded or something.  Try out markers, handrite note and Writepad to see how your text input looks so bad considering."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app, definitely more options than s note or s memo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"In my opinion needs: <TYPE -Text tool typing clear text>  <DRAW - geometry tool,line,rectan> <EDIT -Transform tool(stretch,rotate,etc) selectbox handles -edit vect. points of lines -change color after,line&fill> <CONTROL -grid\snap option -unit&rulers option(cm,points,inch)> <IMPORT\EXPORT -more&local export, not only share> <KEEP IT SIMPLE !... generate easily anywhere PDF with huge detail and small memory size to send, a dream, perfect for project developing  please do it!  WOULD BE BEST APP EVER  Regards"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Better than snote, really smooth!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive and just amazing app. I have HTC Jetstream with Magic Pen and its the only one app that is easy and funny to use to draw some notes and sketches."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"If I could import a picture and write on it, would pay money today."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Much more responsive than Samsung Note and Memo. Will give 5 STARS if you add sync to evernote or drive"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For work related activities this app is better than S Note!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Got to have with galaxy note. Love the one finger erase and ease of copy paste. Just need a way to add screen capture images."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Outside of the new A-Note application for Samsung Galaxy Note owners who upgraded to Ice Cream Sandwich, this app is the best alternative. Very functional and seamless."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Works very nicely, still a bit beta-ish. Pinch to zoom doesn't seem to work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much. I got my s pen back. Lol. Even pressure sense works."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"nice interface, works very well. I just wish it had widgets to put notes and notebooks on the home screen, and if it could automatically open to the last written page instead of the first to save me scrolling a long time to start a new page. I also haven't figured out how to delete pages from notebooks, or insert them in the middle, if possible."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Im going to college and plan on trying this for note taking. Keep up the good work guys!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I don't really know what purpose these ""S-Pen"" apps serve, but of the ones I've tried, this one is the best. I wish I could really find a use for it in my everyday life, but I am just not prompted to write things down often. And if I am, I could care less about font color, cut & paste, etc. I'd actually love to see a list of suggestions for how to incorporate this type of program into making life easier. Possibly there's just something I'm not even considering. Thanks!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good app!! Functionality wise, interface, awesome!! :))"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use. Like the infinite scrolling and zoom function. Very responsive in galaxy 10.1"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Wonderful app with some bugs (Icons overlap on the galaxy note). Needs two features right away to make it useful:  1) Automatically sync across devices preferably using a google account like the s note.  2) Make it cross platform. Need app for Windows 8."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app...especially the graph pages. Works great with my galaxy tab 10.1. I can write very small with this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Need automated synch with google task"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use it every day to take notes with my HTC Jetstream and Scribe pen and it is really great. I love the lasso feature to select things and I can write resting my hand on the device screen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very promising application that's already quite usable and very convenient."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Good palm rejection, i enjoy it for my work"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Need to be addressed. -lagging when using S-pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app comes in handy when I have to jot down something quickly in class. Especially, when I can erase with my finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"have  Galaxy Note...nice app but the phone is better"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love it! Best note app to date!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome.."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive and smart note taking app. Samsung Spen functionality is a big bonus!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"excellent with galaxy note best by far"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Only if the app allowed resting the hand on the screen while writing."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent best for notes on galaxy note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Definately the smoothest note taking app I've used on my Lenovo Think pad Tablet so far."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's not dissapearing for me, but blank rectangles flash before a pen stroke settles in.  LOVE the organization! Also had single-finger to erase, tried to scroll & erased instead. Maybe I had lazy finger, but it eas diconcerting."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love the interface. A little more features for convenience and functionality and it's perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic program. It is very easy to use and the layout is very well done. It has become my goto app to quickly make notes. I give it as many stars as there are in the heavens.  Thanks and kudos to the developer crew."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The features already present are really neat, my fav are: * Vector Graphics * Cut, Copy, Paste, Duplicate * Pen Button Gestures * As many labeled notes within a Notebook  I'd like the following, and then this will be my only note taking app: * Import and resize image * Preset pen and pencils * Back up entire notebooks * Have option to change view of notes from thumbnails to list * Basic geometric shapes * Be able to resize copied or duplicated vectors"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Well designed"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect application for taking notes with the s-pen. The best alternative when you got a custom Rom on your Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Eraser implementation is poor ATM, otherwise perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app is ideal for taking meeting notes and creating diagrams etc. Very cool!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Taking note with this app is so much fun. Love its feature to export the note to pdf"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Very hard to write as the s-pen and finger/palm don't work well if both touch at the same time which usually happens at some point, need to disable capacitive detection! Try it, start drawing with the pen then whatever your drawing goes away when touch the display at the same time, regardless of what touch setting is set to"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great for taking note for school. I love the new page limit feature. I also like the finger to erase,pen to write feature. I have replaced s memo with this app, I used to like s memo better but this grew on me. Great to use with cloud print..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice interface, easy to use but it needs a zoom writing feature like the one in Freenote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just love this app, so simple yet so powerful"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great app, hope the full version be able to share the notes on twitter as pictures, once it does, will get the 5 stars."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its great app.... very nice and easy."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Does almost everything I need it to. Organized my notebooks. Allows infinite paper size. Has blank or lined paper. Multiple colors. Like mentioned in other reviews it would be nice if I could erase sections of things instead of the entire mark but that's not a big deal. My only request would be that it could import pictures to write over. Other than that it's pretty much perfect!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Downloaded app and found it to be very useful!!!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Works great with the new update on my note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great! Excellent!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"But i sent a note to a friend with gmail.  She never got it and it wasn't in my outbox..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Awesome app guys, leaves Samsungs inbuilt app for DEAD!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app works great on my Lenovo ThinkPad tablet! So natural to write on!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Why couldn't HTC have created something this incredible?  Please work towards adding synchronized audio notes with what I am writing to make this the greatest notetaking app ever.  I would pay stupid money if you did this and had it automatically synchronize back to Evernote like HTC had originally promised."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Samsung should add this app as a default note application in their Galaxy Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Its so simple, its great"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have a Note and it works great. Slick app and easy to use. Great looking as well. I'm sure I'll come along some feature requests, but the basis is pretty awesome."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I love smemo for my galaxy note, but need cut and paste function.  This solves that problem and then some!  Better organization and a cleaner interface."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This is a great app. I have only one small caveat. I'd like the eraser to be exact instead of erasing the entire mark. Other than that I love the design and it works great."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great app, finally updated to support Samsung galaxy Note running ICS, Good support from projectpapyrus team. I definitely recommend.  Rolo"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I use this app on my Galaxy Note. It is amazing for writing and note taking. It completely replaces paper for notes. I love it and recommend it to anyone with a Note."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is an incredibly useful and well thought out note application. Very versatile, works awesome on my Galaxy Note and makes note taking and exporting simple."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"No palm rejection"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to app when it comes to note-taking with the S Pen. Keep up the good work."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I know this is still I'm beta but the fact that it costs nothing still impresses me! This is a very sold product and makes Quill look amateur. I've been using LectureNotes and I must say that this app might actually best it.. I wish I would have stumbled upon this app sooner! Great work, thanks to the developers for creating such a solid product with a simplistic and intuitive design!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best notetaking app yet. Highly recommended!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on my xoom"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There are a handful of good note taking apps that use HTC Scribe technology, but this is by far the best application I have used. Scribe takes full advantage of the pen's pressure sensitivity to produce written notes which look like they were actually written on paper."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great features. Simple to use. Would love to see the drawing potential of this app realised with svg export, vector manipulation tools and layers."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note-taking app!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I know it wasn't intended as a drawing app, but holy cow, the vectorish lines are perfect for inking. In fact, I wish other apps applied the same pen style as yours.   The only thing I wish for is the ability to change backgrounds. Update: Doesn't work with ICS. Will we be expecting an update soon? :D"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"For my purposes this works better than Galaxy S Notes.  Very responsive to penstrokes.  Being able to use your finger as a different tool e.g. eraser is genius.  Seamlessly shares with Evernote.  I would pay for this app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow, I'm actually surprised pressure writing works under non Samsung ROM's. Keep up the good work. (:"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app worked wonders on my galaxy note, But after ics update i couldn't install it anymore,"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I would have expected to see on my HTC flyer. The keyboard doesn't randomly pop up on you, and it is so far the only decent writing app for the scribe technology. I use my scribe pen with this app without having to take a picture with the scribe pen and I can edit whenever I want. this app should come standard on any scribe device. this is scribe done right."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Smooth working note taking app which works great on my Galaxy Note. 5 stars if there were widgets to see notes directly from the home screen :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly on htc flyer, just like writing on paper"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Anxiously waiting for more and more  cool updates."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"This app has great potential. If you could only come up a way to enable palm rejection, it could be perfect. And the best part is it's free. Enable palm rejection and I'm sold. .."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"The 2 finger scroll feature cant be disabled and this causes the page to wobble around while writing whenever the butt of your hand touches it, making it barely usable at times and extremely frustrating. So for this reason alone I had to give it 3 stars. Otherwise it would've been a 5 star app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",2,"Fasy & responsive. Would be nice if it seamless integration with Evernote."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This app worked great until I updated my GNote to the ICS 4.0.3. Now it states in Google Play that it is incompatible to my GNote and the S-Pen does not work with the app. Very strange."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was using this on Galaxy Note, it is hands down the best pen app in Android. I'm an extensive Onenote2010 user on a tablet PC. Why can't Samsung make something like this? Why can't Microsoft add inking in Onenote? I didn't have my hopes high, but Papyrus is really easy to use for writing notes with the pen, and quickly erasing with fingers is very easy. Can't believe this app didn't win first prize on Samsung Spen developer contest.  The only con that I see for now is that it doesn't support ICS, so I'm stuck with the sucky slow/lagging Samsung S-note app. I'm actually not writing any notes for now. ICS, there's also an option to show where the pointer dot is so it'll get even better once Papyrus supports ICS.  For the future, it would be nice if it can sync notes on Dropbox or somewhere on the cloud so that I don't lose the notes. A PC version note viewer/PDF converter would be nice too."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I was so desparate for a program where handwritten notes could be itemized. Not only does this app offer this, It has the most innovative gestures and features of any handwriting app yet! The Lenovo ThinkPad support is excellent! N-trig stylus support and handwriting quality in unparalleled. Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I've tried many and this app is just the best. It all works as it should on my HTC flyer, from the best response to the smart pen I have used to the options. If you have an flyer try it out!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I'd love an option to duplicate notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Perfect with the S-pen. You can actually take real notes."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"От недолгого использования программы только положительные эмоции. Писать и рисовать действительно очень удобно. Спасибо!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Of all the note-taking apps I've tried, this has been the best. Responds well to the s pen, making writing very natural. Encountered two different issues with palm swiping and having the create icons covering the notes, but after emailing them about it, they responded that they will be addressing those issues. It's great that they respond to feedback and I look forward to the updates that will make this app even better!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works great on Lenovo thinkpad. Much beter than mobile notes and quill. If only sketchbook could have this great funcionality."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Great features with simplicity UI, it becomes my primary note taking app now.   Keep it on."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app that I would gladly pay for once finished with more features and the beta label removed.. I am very much looking forward to the progress the developer has in store because if this beta is any indication of what they can do..  then this already GREAT! app will be AMAZING!! once it's finished."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"Very polished and intuitive. Input feels natural. Palm rejection, stylus input, finger erase is a slick combination. Needs better page size and zooming options. I can't make note size of portrait display, then zoom to width in landscape display and scroll up, down. Needs more brush options, layers, pic import and placement, real text input, and resizable note widgets."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Really love this app but can't use it full time until 2 options are put in place:  -highlighting -import via picture/camera  I use them on a daily basis, need it for sure! Please update real soon with these options."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Add some painting brush for drawing user."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just need to add a few tools as suggested by others well done"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent with the spen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Right out of the gate...can't wait to see future additions"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Excellent customer service, I received a reply from them shortly after I wrote to them. Love their application and I'll be ready to buy their application once it is out of beta. Keep up the great work guys"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Very responsive and great simplistic layout. I am only giving four stars because it would be better if a palm guard of some sort would be implemented for writing. Perhaps in the next update? But otherwise, this is a fantastic application!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Especially for galaxy note. It's much, much better than the native handwriting app provided by Samsung. Love that you can scribble using the S-Pen and then use your finger to erase your mistakes. Please keep on working on this app and improve on it, this app is a winner."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I have been using this App for some days and I am very well impressed. The writing with SPen is very responsive and smooth. It is far better than Skich and it provides features that overcome S Memo's limitations. However, to be a full fledged note taking App, it should also include the following features:  - detect & enhance basic shapes (oval, rectangle, triangle, etc) - import images/photos as objects - resize/rotate of objects or groups of objects - export notes/notebooks in jpg/png (its interesting for those who wish a better integration with Evernote) - export notes in standard vector graphics format (e.g., svg) - additional brush/pen types (e.g., highlight marker, pencil, paint brush, etc) - Pinch to zoom"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just what is required to make use of the pen. Brilliant.  Integration into OneNote would be the ultimate. Is this feasible? I'd pay for it if it was."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Needs a zoom feature."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This S-Pen app is fast, accurate and I love the capability to erase using finger."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Pls provide an option to disable back button on galaxy note when using the app in portrait mode. Definetly 5 star then. By the way, awesome app. Thanks dev"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Finally a true vector ink notebook app for Android! Except for Skitch (in a limited way) no one else really seems to get the need for this. I really missed the robust implementation of ink on tablet PC.    I'm looking forward to the full development of this product for those of us who also need tools to capture ""right-brained"" info instead of just ""alpha-numeric characters in little square boxes""    Small business owner using Galaxy note"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Just needs zoom and it'd be the perfect sketch app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"G Note spen  support and G Drive will be perfect."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"A very well designed piece of software."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app, exporting to pdf is great and it keeps it as vector. pen pressure sensitivity on the galaxy note is amazing, better than anything on the note currently.even great to do ink sketches with. 5 stars"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taking app yet. Hope the developer can incorporate sync function with desktop/cloud for edition (2 way sync), full screen mode, and wacom full pen support (eraser and side buttons)."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Great App, Love It!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I would like to give a fully comprehensive and heart felt appraisal for this app. it is the best app i have used for note taking and just makes the s pen functions that more special. I salute you for your brilliance.. keep it up!!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Best note taker...period"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is th best"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"The best part is being able to write without worying about my other fingers touching the screen. So far good app. Using Galaxy Note with S-Pen"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"It's new but functional and it's pretty good! :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Not 5 stars because share options have 5 alternatives versus more than 20 in S Memo native app for Galaxy Note with Gingerbread. I miss to share with Google+"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very useful app and it has many good features that s memo lacks. I really like the interface as well. Can't wait for new features. Also works well with s pen."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Love the pen sensitivity, eraser, vectors. Sync with Google Docs will make it 5 stars for sure."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"There are lots of things to like and I just want to highlight the selecting function is very smart. I can easily select the items I want on a busy note. And I cant leave without saying this app is fast, even on my kindle fire with no hardware acceleration."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This app has changed the way that I take notes on my Samsung Galaxy Note.  The ability to use s-pen input for writing and finger input for erasing is genius and so practical!  I look forward to the addition of increased functionality in future updates, such as syncing notes between devices.  A must have for Galaxy Note owners!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Just feels like I'm writing in a notebook. Eraser option is very smart. Like this a lot."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"S pen sensitive pressure woks"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Add support to import Quill notes and notebooks...I'm sold!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Let me be clear: this is the best implementation I've seen of the S Pen by far. It leaves Samsung's own S Memo far behind, at least until that Premium Suite drops.  Pressure sensitivity actually works and shows several levels. Notes can be expanded with two-finger scrolling both vertically and horizontally. Transition between landscape and portrait mode is seamless. I don't know how they do it, but the pen just seems to work better than on any other app. All of the other note-taking apps, especially those using the keyboard, are dead to me.  And of course then you have the beautiful, simple user interface that lets you do the things you actually want to do with one click.  It's clear that the creator wants to be make something more than ""another note-taking app"", so I'm sure there are a lot more features coming. Although it's not adequate for heavy drawing, but then there are other aps for that. And for now it's all free!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very good note taking app. Erasing with the figure is very cool and being able to plant your hand on the screen without it making marks is very nice. Much better than the stock note taking app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"S-pen needs to learn all these tricks, or papyrus has to get voice appending, pic addition and s-planner integration."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"That was exactly what I was looking for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This application is very well tuned to the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note. Kudos!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Very smooth writing, much more responsive than S-Memo. Easy erasing with fingers. Good export functions as well, which comes in handy.   I was overall surprised by this app. A must-have for note taking.  a tip for future development: using the s-pen button to activate functions (erasering, moving,...)?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Brilliant accuracy with handwriting strokes and a fluid UI makes it awesome! <3  Kudos to the developers! :)"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This looks great! You could really win the s-pen competition! :-) But where is the paid/donate version?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"First the greatest positive...you can adjust the pen tip size. Needs more s pen support especially for the button, that and a small addition of writing surfaces...even I would pay."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've been looking for a good notebook app for the longest time  now and Papyrus is definitely the best that I have found so far for what I want to do. I only wish that there were a pure typed text functionality in addition to the handwriting. Oh and maybe a way to insert images as well."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"definitely Worth the download"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Lovely paper like notes, on htc flyer works great with pen, but by default finger erases and 2 fingers allows you to move around - when trying to use 2 fingers, half of the time it erases instead. Just change in settings 1 finger to do nothing and problem solved. Please make this the default in the next version or even better set 1 finger to move content. If basic shapes e.g. rectangles were added also then this is a 5 star product worth paying for."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"simple and very easy to use.looking forward to changing background colour, share as image."

"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Far better than the native HTC notes app for two big reasons - it exports to pdf and it has a lasso tool to cut/paste/move.   Would be nice if it could mesh with OneNote, but that probably won't happen..."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Could you make it so that you have a choice on what the HTC scribe pen buttons do, just like you have set for one touch finger input?"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Using the stylus side buttons make editing easy.  I wish the app had the ability to import pdf documents to annotate on them.  Pretty good for a beta release."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"Nice product, one of the best I have tried"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works much better than the HTC Note app. Writing mechanics are very smooth. Great app."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",4,"I've got an HTC Flyer with the active stylus and I've always wanted something that's more drawing-oriented than the base pen tools that came with device. Papyrus delivers a solid, basic drawing system with user-definable colors, pen sizes and pressure support on the stylus. It's a very, very good start to a more complete drawing/painting application.  While I would love to see some tool variety and a few extra features, I know this tool will be on my Flyer from this point on!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"I wasn't sure how to delete a note, so wrote to them and within a few minutes I got back a reply - - ""Yes, you can delete notes by long pressing on a note thumbnail in the ""notebook view"" (main page after launching Papyrus). Delete and rename options will appear in the upper right. You can also click multiple notes in that mode to delete them at the same time. You can also long press on notebooks to rename or delete them as well.""  Fantastic customer support.  Highly recommend this app.  Am using it on my Transformer Prime."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"Works flawlessly on my flyer, especially for a beta! The interface is very clean and intuitive. I love the feature of using your finger as a quick eraser. I'd love to see more features like handwriting recognition or at least fitting to a baseline like Asus' supernote app but its definitely not a deal breaker."
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",3,"This seems like it will be a great app as it advances out of beta. Using it on my TF101 with a stylus. I have been taking notes on my tablet since the fall and use freenote+ but would consider this if it had more features. The ability to write and have the words snap to the line would be nice or the ability to zoom in and increase spacing. As of now it would be very difficult for me to write good, legible notes. Keep up the good work though!!"
"Squid: Take Notes, Markup PDFs","Unknown",5,"This is the best note taking app I have found for taking keeping track of what is happening in meetings, even without an active pen tablet."
