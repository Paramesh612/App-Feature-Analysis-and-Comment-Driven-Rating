"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I don't write in burmese letter ‚Äã·Ä± in spradsheet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Made a mistake. Wrong program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't even see show to change page orientation. Ridiculous"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Does pretty much everything Microsoft Office does except Access. Not quite as full-feature as Office and a little clunky on a phone, but adequate for most home office needs. I've used it for years and haven't used Office since I retired (2 years ago)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like this app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"App acting up again, works on samsung A70 And doogee V20, says free version on samsung S22. All connecting to this google account. Lost my paid features again, really annoying..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"2/27/25 Have un-installed 6 times and again just now. Deleted the APK, ran Avast cleanup, and power off/on. Problem persists when offline. App wants to talk to Google Play and can't do so offline (this wasn't a problem before the pre-January update). Users cannot ALWAYS stay connected when they use your app. Please put it back the way it was."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"You cannot print. You cannot save as pdf. You cannot upload. What is the point of installing this software? There is no point. Uninstall it and never look back."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It allows simple editing on the phone, signing documents, and sent off while you are on the road."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well for me. I can encrypt files I need to as well as have a word processor and spreadsheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OK"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Another bait and switch. Free... Unless you want to access any cloud storage or do anything but the absolute basics. Uninstall."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Overall, it's a nice app. Needs dark mode. Black background white text do not just invert colors."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best office software. Free and sensible. They listen to users to improve all the time"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Last reviewed in 2014. I hope it's better now in 2025."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Open Office is awesome! Better than Word for sure! :-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"best app ever great for either finger poking office apps on screen or with bluetooth keyboard and mouse on Samsung Dex"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's got a lot of features, and they WORK. This type of rare app gives back the freedom typically lost in mobile apps. Fits in a phone yet has the options of a desktop program. Best of both worlds."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It seems it doesn't support the function WEBSERVICE( ) on Android 15."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"3 Rd class app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great option for working with ODF format documents. Since it is a 32-bit application, it is more efficient than its 64-bit counterparts in working with ODF documents. I love LibreOffice on the desktop, yet AndOpenOffice is great on Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great App, but it really needs a night mode, so you don't have to burn out the retinas! It is possible to change the background to black, but the buttons and borders are still blindingly white. Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is far better than any other word processor I have ever used. Integration with the other apps is good, all the other apps."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It would be better if there is an option to lock the sliding filtering selection box, and enable touch scrolling for filling data."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app, works well for opening open office and Microsoft office documents"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull app but should be improved to enhance all keybord shortcuts, please. Thanks for your good job."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"While doing presentation it is closing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Just purchase the app. I opened an xlsx file but the first 77 rows have the columns A through H covered with a bluish opeque block. I cannot get rid of it. I am using Android 13 on a tablet. Please advise how to get rid of it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very complete. Has a few bug, but the most annoying is the protection system by password. Doesn't have option to show. Number of character limited but doesn't warn you. That makes the app impossible to use for me. Let me know when corrected and I will reconsider."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Just don't see a way to print envelopes when doing a document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Full featured. Cross platform capabilities. PDF export. Very responsive and numerous add-ons. 2 1/2 years now...this app continues to perform flawless ‚ú®Ô∏è Dito üòé"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Urdu and Arabic fonts not working good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app, lets you create doc, excel etc for FREE TO USE... Then if you want more stuff, you can upgrade with ONE TIME 20 bucks. I upgraded and having fun. I use open office on laptop too. ... all apps should be FULL USE, then pay ONE TIME FEE to upgrade. Only problem corrected when i checked ""opt out of data collection"""
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far so good! Got this to replace bloat ware which came with my tablet. So far it is performing perfectly and beyond my expectations. Would be 5* if advert free, but such is life for this type of. App."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A fully functional and very versatile alternative to all the others. And just like the theme others takes time to learn its functions and how to manipulate it to do what you want first class am considering a purchase to unlock some permanent content . thanks guys n girls keep up the good work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very finicky, only works about 3% of documents, can create documents, but then can't open them.. or can open, but not edit..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome. üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's causing more issues than not having it. Lost files and it's renaming files. Without user input"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's good because it's free, but isn't really intuitive to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"If you're used to Windows office this is going to really get you where you want to go. The affordability is the real draw here, and you get all the support you need. Super thumbs up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"MUY FUNCIONAL, ABRE ARCHIVOS SIN PROBREMAS... OK OK"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A solid choice for Apache/OpenOffice users on Android. Pretty smooth transitions between desktop and mobile, for those who need to edit on the go."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not at all useful üòí"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ABSOLUTELY VERY USEFUL APP, I'll DONE MY PROJECT VERY EARLY LIKE BRO PLS USE THIS APP!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Why is there no open source office suite for Android that's any good? This one isn't properly compatible with LibreOffice. And it's only half converted from a PC app. Many operations use function keys or need a right click. I don't have F11 on my tablet!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app need to support ODF document version 1.3"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Using on my android ereader (boox) with bluetooth keyboard. Love it!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use it to read spread sheet files. Works."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is very helpful for those people who not afford the pc because it have the amazing features because it realize to you are sitting on the pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's a great tool, I use it create ods spreadsheet file locally for tracking purposes. However, one thing that is undesirable is how frequently the app complain that my ods file is corrupted. I often open up my ods file, found it is corrupted so I had to take some time to save the repair file and delete the corrupted file. It is very annoying, I hope the devs can investigate it and fix it asap so that i can consistently work with my ods file. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does everything I want, and is largely intuitive. Otherwise the Help solves my problem. Top app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This application is a wonderful series of tools"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I found 4 issues but not with Walmart. I don't have a problem with Walmart. Walmart has everything I ever need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"not sure what this app is trying to do"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Have to upgrade to paid subscribe version to print. Grrrrr"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can you say, Clunkware? I used this for 10 minutes on my Chromebook...... Opening a PDF shipping label with 3d bar codes made a mess of everything. Opening an Avery Label template word file completely broke the formatting. I can see where this is heading..... I have no use for this kind of time-wasting app - uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very cool app and exactly like libre office . I am using the app first time and it looks I have been using this app for years."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent and modern."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app For school project and practice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is full version of open office, when i used it long back in 2009...great to see.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well. Bugs have been fixed!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The original version by Apache is free with no ads. This is a poor port."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The app is glitchy, not particularly easy-to-use on a tablet. I keep having issues with it duplicating words and sentences randomly. I paid for the full app, though, like an idiot, so I'm stuck with it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this app but can you add openofficebase also as I downloaded this app for this purpose but I donot get only my purpose. CAN YOU ADD OPENOFFICEBASE. ALL OTHER THINGS ARE GOOD"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a great little app. I used it to finish self-publishing my book after a computer failure. I highly recommend getting a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to use on your tablet. The only feature I wish it had that would keep me from using it exclusively is the lack of OpenType feature support. I work in Syriac a little, and I need something that uses OpenType positioning and contextual variants. That's the only reason why it's not 5 stars for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I run android 6.0.1 opposite R9 plus, and have tried other apps in this category, but this one, is the, Best, I love the app, and it's unlike any I have seen, so thank you developer, and keep doing the good work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I compare with other available programs, so far, very good a specially dealing with open office documents. Permanent license could be cheaper since app is based on open source code"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Awful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great value for cost"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app But it lags sometimes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Wanted to make some simple calculations in a table (spreadsheet) and it worked just fine. Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"poor ui"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not bad. A little cumbersome one you realize you have to use the""mouse"" feature to manipulate an arrow around. But I needed an Excel spreadsheet without trackers or ads and this fit the bill."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's really good to use on cellular network and it's so easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A great port of open office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works now! Thanks for the advice to uninstall and reinstall. üòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"9...c"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I got this to replace Office 365. For whatever reason it was taking so long to open my files that it would time out. This works almost perfectly, except I cannot get it to read my files back to me. I do that to proof read."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good and simple plus free!!! Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oooooohhhh my God, this is exactly I was missed from other apps...

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is SO MUCH BETTER than the Microsoft app, it is unreal! It is SO user-friendly that it is very easy to find what you need for edits, etc.!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Buona anche la condivisione dei file attraverso posta e WA , tutto il resto utilissimo e simile all'applicazione Windows"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpfull to me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Why is the PDF not saving? Help us in this now"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like this app. It is easy for a person thats new to this type of program to use. But, is inclusive of most of the features that a more advanced user would want to use. Thank you and happy holidays, Robert V."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The app is convenient and apparently well-behaved."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Make a doc: surprise, you can't print it unless you pay up. Absolute dog‚Äî"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Very compatible. To the developers and programmers I can only say thanks. It contains some high priced features which it did not even expect. Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can't use this because some giant formatting screen covers everything and the interface is very unfamiliar and unusable. I want to live it but I just uninstall."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. There are many options you can take off the tool bar, to make less cluttered. If you are a Word user saving a file is a bit different but easy once get the idea"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and I have used it for years"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Powerful app. I would consider the paid version but sadly the upgrade button and the detail buttons dont work. Update: tried the suggested actions. Still doesnt work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Supposed to be free. Shouldn't need a licence to print."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Goes a long way to mirror Apache Open Office, but I am unable to get it to create a hyperlink to a local pdf file when using the spreadsheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst and worst...all documents are lost"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"‚ô•Ô∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Everything you do on this is pay to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It doesnt work properly, the moment i choose select reange under data validation, there no more cursor show up that i need to select the range, and it suddenly frozen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very important for dav lessons from my booküìï"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Linux's freedom! Thanx!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well intuitive to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Something happened with the view shortly after my last review 4 years ago. The UI never got better and there are many apps performing way above this one now."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Takes over files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The application seems effective overall, but I did note some aberrations with some of the lettering who h appears irregular in all areas. I'm not sure either these aberrations are caused by the application or via the technology the document was edited on."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fantastic though needs pdf support"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great on Android with pCloud."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great alternative to MS Office spyware."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very frustrating to use due to its complexity. Selecting text is almost impossible, maddening. The 2-finger method of enlarging the view doesn't work. Viewing PDFs is inconsistent. You can't easily move the cursor or even create a plain, unnumbered list. The imbedded help file is nearly worthless. Try doing an index search on the words bullet or cursor and nothing is found! It's the opposite of KISS. User friendly, this is not!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I cannot create a database in this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It was very good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Used to kinda work. Now it won't."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Used mostly for text. Need better interface to import PDF files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Slow dowloading and if you waste my data for nonsense you will see me lm watching you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app for many document formats but i cant find the zoom in function somehow. Thats anoting for this app that is used on my smartphone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Helps make your android more functional when cloud apps don't fit the bill."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The spreadsheet works well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great office suite which is available on windows and android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app have not the database üò°üò°"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"NOT FREE"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ottimo"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cannot read anything."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app for office use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The best document editing app, until you have to pay to export it...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I'm a writer by trade. It does exactly as I require."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Kindly include desktop layout button again like previous version, otherwise it would be inconvenient for the user, whenever we install the physical keyboard & mouse to the device the task bar at the bottom of the screen reduces the screen size, if desktop mode is on then the task bar automatically goes to the top of the screen like previous version which was convenient for the user, plz. Fix it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"One of the best offi e apps EVER!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Within 1 minute after installing, I was copying text (from my Lists App) to a new document and editing it, saving it to my small flash drive in my phone! This seems like a real Keeper! AndrOpen Office is Very Similar to my laptop's LibreOffice and is easy to use and Free! I wonder how much they want for the Paid Version?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy and cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Looks nice on phone. That's about all. Totally useless. Uninstalling app. Don't bother, folks! It doesn't behave like any other word processor/editor, all of which have similarities in use. To app creator: Until you actually have a working app, I'd suggest that you remove it from Google Play Store."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works when I need it--desktop and Android phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Still the BEST!! THANKS AGAIN! EXCELLENT!!!! BEST OUT THERE!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. Insisting to enable Google Play. Wanted pdf reader & not Google Play."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Rw to google drive! Best Android Libre Office/Mickeysoft office replacement."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far this has been good. Wish i could insert multiple lines or columns. Currently it is one at a time and have to go back through menus to do next one. Much better experience overall over two other sheets i have rejected and deleted."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Found it to be very good and easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I can't use my custom added urdu fonts. The office don't write properly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I loved this app before the ability to fine tune text size to fit into my chosen area was no longer allowed. I have need of fitting various amounts of text into a certain number of columns and could make font size smaller or larger than predetermined whole or half sizes to reach that goal (i.e. 7.3 size) Now it's equal to Google Sheets which now offers columns (only 3 so far) and limited font size selection. How about AOO Lite to ape Sheets and regular AOO desktop-style for flexibility? 5‚≠êprior"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Functional but definitely some glitches. First, the app only opens in read-only mode when editing, allowing me to only edit a copy of the file rather than the file itself. Also the presentation part of the app as far as I can see does not have a function to allow timings to change slides after however many seconds."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Android Open Office is a port for Android of the Apache Open Office that exists for distributions of Linux and for Apple IOS. Yet, Android Open Office is surprisingly rich in possibilities, not crippled in comparison to the Apache Open Office for Linux or IOS. For Linux and IOS there is also the option of Collabora Libre Office, but this does not seem to exist for Android. The true international document format is Open Document, because PDF is property of Adobe and DOCX is property of Microsoft."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"quite a useful program. some improvement needed in placement of pop up dialogs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app Could you please make an android version for open office calc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love OpenOffice, and this is a great Android port of the program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like Microsoft Office but better and free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's always good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Getting used to it but it seems to be OK. Not all the bells and whistles of the pc version but then, I never used all of those anyway."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app for spread sheets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"bahut hi aachaa hai bhai"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Many pdf files do not conver to clear printing and is always half eligible and half ineligible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Very slow downloading processs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Other tools was disappear like editing the words in PDF."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The Android version more complicated to us than the Windows version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well, and does what it's expected to do. Performs more friendly than MS-360 Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Will continue to maximize the capabilities of this App the element of capturing spreadsheets with the mobility to navigate remains pivotal and assimilated"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love Appache Open Office on my desktop & I was so happy to find out from their website that they make this all for android. Love it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"x64 equivalent on Linux Open Source features. Thank you very much for being very helpful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"See open source, Open Office, .ODT files right on your Android device. A little clumsy but doable"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Free WMF file viewer - no hassle"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good night sweet dreams take care of yourself and bye bye bhabhi"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fanastic. suppors all the formats and no ads. does want to default to its file format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It gets the job done"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Every other update causes password protected Excel spreadsheets or Word documents to NOT open. After interacting with your support staff, they said it never worked with password protected files, WHICH IS FALSE! Because I've been able to before. They don't even know their own product."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This office suite works well for me. I recommend the upgrade to support the development and porting of future versions for Android ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent, transforms my mobile into a computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful app! I found that the CEILING function does not work. Is it possible to add it? Thank you for a pleasant experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Underrated (I use free edition) you think it takes a while to get the app, but no (for me at least) I had this app for less than a day and I already love it and understand it. When I open the app from file manager (samsung my files) it goes to read-only mode and when I open it with this app, it goes to edit mode (like it's supposed to)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Love the fact that AOO is compatible with apache open office, just one thing to typing is a little wanky especially when backspacing on a letter and it ends up take a extra one or two plus... other than that everything looks good.. haven't checked all the features though... looking to see if there a tab button somewhere, it make proper indentation easier than hitting the space bar 5 times everything I wanted to start a new paragraph."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fabulous, only issue is not being able to upgrade because I don't seem to be able to buy through Google."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Completely worthless and unusable on Android. Has so much clutter on the screen the actual document consumes less than a quarter of the display. Seems to have no zoom options. Will not allow editing of documents. This is what happens when you try to use a desktop user interface on anything that is not a desktop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"While typing in Writer, it randomly removes spaces between words as I type and joins the two words. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling app but it does not help. Very annoying. Using in Chromebook."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have used this app for a few years and like it a lot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Expecting payment so I could print. Fraud"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Goggle drive connect is premium feature"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow ... Absolutely fabulous. Formatting better than WPS office... ... I'm using mainly spreadsheet ... I use Libre office and Excell on my PC - seamless integration."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super Excellent, ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è, I find this type of application for a long time, at last i have got.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Works well like in the old days on PC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great alternative to 365, Lately 365 has problems that I think they want $$$"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good to work with and very complete but some features are hard to find"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Missing a few things like automatic capitalisation after a period. But all in all a solld program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super...all functions works the best.....thanks people who did it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for my Christmas newsletter for years. It saves me $350 because I don't have need to buy WP."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Does not work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, but keep it completely free. Programming World will be worshipping you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It says that it's all free, I decided to try to make an address label, all went well with no problems UNTIL I went to print the label. You have to upgrade to the paid version to be able to print. I'm not going to spend time writing practice documents testing the program to decide if it's worth buying. I can fully understand you wanting to limit free use BUT maybe a time limit or printing a limited number of pages? This has turned me off getting it I'll try another office program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice job gooooooooood.......üëçüëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It kept losing my work when the tablet entered sleep mode. I had auto save enabled and would hit save manually quite often. But on three different occasions, I came back to my document only to find it reverted to a version hours earlier, with no apparent way to find or recover my recent changes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Functions perfectly with Libre Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"How can I upgrade to the paid version? Taping the buttons to ""Upgrade"" or ""Detail"" doesn't do anything."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Simple Effective app for creating and editing documents. Does everything I require it to do. The UI takes some getting used to, but its intuitive and much easier to use on a tablet than office 365."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Bangla Front doesn't work properly Please fix it soon"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great APP Lots of features. Confuses me, but I do like it and feel it has many uses. abmo URL processor ignored"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Flawless using for at least ten years! Thank you Apache and OpenOffice developers!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever, the controls and tools are the worst. Microsoft is way to smoother. Just bcs of school I have to use it. When I try any tool it suddenly dispaper and don't not appear and the app close automatically. Rewire your app then again upload in play store. Fast! I have to do my project work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's nice but sorry some problem with me using this app so my feedback is this app is better not enough better üòï"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good for all your help"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Great but no pdf export for free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Charging for this app version is a bad idea since the PC version Open Office full version is free. I'll try looking for another free app to print my documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Allows me all the functions as normal office. Thank You."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I rate it 5 star because, some people that cannot afford laptop or pc that people can use this application to study . I myself study in class 10 and preparing for CBSE board exam and this is same as open office. But only thing i don't like was that for some features it tell to take premium first."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sangat bagus"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I used to really like this app, but resent updates have made it less useful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand and utilize ... Nice presentation besides ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best office application in the world"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use, to open and revise worksheets prepared on a laptop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is helpful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is excellent and exactly what I needed: a full version LibreOffice on my phone. Every other option compromised features or workflow sync options. It is a little crowded on a phone, but even someone clumsy like me can get up to speed quickly to update my existing docs. I was a bit thrown on the ODT version compatibility (I don't even know how to natively switch ODT versions on desktop) so I hope that support is added soon. Otherwise, it was an immediate upgrade for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It took me a little while to figure out how to use the app on my phone, but once I did, I loved it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need it to do. Very happy with it. Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fabulous for 20 yrs * Open Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"AndrOpen Office will not open past the splash screen and run unless it is allowed internet access. A text app does not need internet access. and for privacy reasons I do not permit writing apps to have web access. It's a shame because it is quite decent and I would have bought it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Would be nice if the keyboard opened up on it's own instead of you having to push the button. Apart from that, when you figure out where things are, the app is great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It hangs on it's own I checked It twice and at the last I have to do my work again because It wasn't reacting at all"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Versatile and powerful. Works well with cloud or local storage."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"How to add macros? and how to add python macros and run it???"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far the experience has been good, but the app needs to be refined since several times the file couldn't be opened for editing and it's to be copied..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I want to copy a file to two other folders. To do this same procedure for each one. I cannot go to one destination and paste the file and then go to the second destination and paste the file again without returning to the local original folder."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best OfficeSuite in Google play"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Updating my review! Decided to purchase about 3 months ago and staying steady at 4 stars. I am happy with the application, but hard to explain, it just seems to still be rough around the edges."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use. Even the help files don't help. Mostly because while the manual opens, the articles do not. It's a good thing I decided to try it without buying it first."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"VERY GOOD APP. HOPE WILL UPDATE TO SAVE IN EXCEL. The new update does not have native ui, and desktop version, and when you edit, copy and paste at the fill cell allways ask confirmation to write it. Very annoying and waste time.. not like version 5.4.3. please correct it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A little slow but it works."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Beats Google or Microsoft. Awesome to be able to use Open Office on an Android. Key bugs for me are no way to turn off autocomplete, and docs keep opening in Read Only mode. It's possible to save to a new file and edit that, but leads to massive, irrelevant duplication of files. To the app makers, I recommend charge for any DL once your product works, an annoying free version won't help. Everyone can afford a $1.19 app. See File Mgr as example."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Worst experience"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Useless on an S23+"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not downloading"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app was not good for class 10 computer practical making"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"So far, it does everything I want it do. Some years later now. the word count has recently decided to give ball park numbers instead of an accurate count. I need that accurate count so I'm back to that windows machine this tablet was to replace. Otherwise it works fine."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It was acting well until I lost my writing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office! Thank you! My troubles are over. After hassling with endless time wasting coy text apps, I am home free. Love yuz!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Opens all my OpenOffice documents with ease, so it does what it's supposed to for me. That makes it a good App' in my opinion."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Can't open excel file from Google drive any more, help."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Having to change review, because of repeated issue that has LOST WORK. Come back to continue working on a file that is open, prompted that it now read only and to open a copy that can be edited, only to find that it reverts back to a previous version that has not included all the times the work was previously saved in the currently open session. Have now lost multiple days work on multiple occasions, which is devastating to a writer and the creative process."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app can open and edit any MS Office document. That and all the built-in tools make this a great app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was great until the latest update removed the ability to save your work unless you update to the paid version. Why offer a free version without the ability to save a file? Issue was fixed with recent update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No printing? I love Apache Open Office and have used it for years with very few complaints. How could I complain about an application which did everything I needed for free? I linked to this app from AOO and thought it was going to be as good. It well may be but I was surprised to hit a pay wall to print. No fancy secondary usage, just print! All I really need is to be able to open some files on the tablet, write then print some notes I think $20 is a little steep. Save to PDF then print."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Use it on Lap Top, Phone, Android Tablet, and Chrome Book. Use Sheets and, and Word, no problems."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app can do its job on an android device well, I have tested the WORD or WRITE application and I can fairly say it can do its job with ease and I need to test the other applications too and if they perform well then maybe I will give a 5 Star, This app is great besides it is free pkease support the developers those who can afford by donating to them, I have always been a fan of open source project a long time ago and developers really needs your donation to furthe update this project. TY."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. The best feature is that it can open password protected documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ok hai"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works without glitches. Compatible with everything."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have Open Office on my pc and notebook. I am glad to finally see it on phones. It works well and I can depend on it in a pinch to get out a document or presentation. I have not ever had any problems with any of the individual suites in this. It is a great alternative to ""Microsplat's"" Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful app and works perfectly. I've been using it for quite awhile. Thank you!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Funciona Bien"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Double clicking on the borders of a sheet is a real test of one's patience and focus"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app. helps me use my chrome book to do some of my schooling work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great App! YES... Five!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good office suitce"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The app works quite well and is very functional. It has a few glitches. I have the Pro version. Support is not very helpful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its the best I have used yet and I purchased the full version straight away. It very nearly mirrors what I see on my desktop computer running Open Office. If I create a document in AndrOffice it appears the same in Open Office, but Open Office to AndrOffice is not quite the same, minor unimportant differences but still I think support for the 1.3 file format is essential and I hope this comes in the not too distant future. But still its an incredible app and running this in DEX is really good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is great alternative to MS mobile office , and WPSOffice with less advertisement."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Full featured at a great price!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to be done"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Smooth app so satisfying"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does what other office apps won't, & does it free. Indispensable"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It does everything I need to do and has a much lower learning curve than the Microsoft product. Also, the price is very right."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"very big and slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Hello I am a writer and I am a Bangladeshi so need to use Bangla. But in my language the all letters are broken. Please Fix it soo I can use my Language"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice to have a fully functional OpenOffice app completely local on an Android device, not run remotely like a different developer did years ago. The only issues I've run into are related to default settings, and are really part of OpenOffice in general, not specific to Android or any other platform; and I've established workarounds by simply saving my own templates and always opening new documents from them instead of the using the standard ""new"" menu selection."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this is the best wordprocessor for my constant use of txt and spreadsheet computation... thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Smooth, light, √°gil, user friendly and not intrusive! Just GREAT... It's been a long search but finally... It WORKS!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Who would support Microsoft?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Sadly will not open .xlsx files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very useful you can use this app for school work and just for fun my son downloaded it 5 years ago since that time it's the only thing he uses apart from games"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very nice to work with. Love the ability to export to PDF."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"AndrOpen Office is an impressive achievement to port this software to Android. Very well done for the complexity. I'm still hacking through the complexity, macros and so on, there are some roadblocks, but I suspect it's my own learning curve as much as the software. One year later it has never updated. Can't get that to work. Good luck y'all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Only somewhat useful. I have used the spreadsheet and word processor and both have the same issue: random completions and deletions. It's annoying and limits the utility of the app. Hit one letter on a cell of the spreadsheet and you get half a word from a previous cell autocompleted and backspacing just brings it back with one less letter, half a line with the word processor. The newest thing is typing a word when suddenly one more character typed and the last word typed disappears."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"l think this is still the first world best office app l have ever used. It is rcih, extensive in function and unbeatable in display. It is stable and does not Crash my documents. It is a great app. Much Thanks to the developer. The one error l discovered is that the document title does not display on the page."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Solid, works for word processing as I need. Wish they'd expunge the odt format though as it's kind of a pain since nothing else I seem to have can use odt. But it's not really a downside as it asks if you want to use odt in the first place."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It works. A little glitchy sometimes, but it works."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tried to use to edit a document from my tablet in an emergency during vacation. When I tried to save my changes, it turned out I had to buy the professional version for around 20 USD. Tried to do it and it got in a verification loop with PayPal that costed me around 5 euros for the validation sms, and still couldn't buy it, so I still couldn't save my document. Don't bother with this app. The text selection and editing is also pretty clunky."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Work with most office products."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Within seconds app crashes and down"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Text size small"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mutch mutch better than Microsoft Word mobile or any similar. It gives you a wordeditor like a PC. One little thing, what I would use and not really working is the Hungarian Spell Check. But anyway I really love it! Edit: I succesfully added hungarian language pack to spell check in settings. I downloaded the language file and the program recognized it when I opened."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is not the perfect app, but for the price, it is a VERY good app. Remember, you have choices when saving. .odt seems to be top-heavy and makes a very large file. .doc is good, and makes a small file. Saving as .pdf is wonderful. A very small file that you cant accidentally screw up when printing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app is beginning to add words in that I did not put there or replacing words that I am typing with words that I had no intention of using, and it often happens when I select a comma."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The AndrOpen Office app is a very reliable android application for recording info ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Looked good but some of saved PDFs I had either wouldn't load or loaded wrong. It turns out printing is a paid function. Pretty much makes this app useless for my needs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Can't print without payment"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well and is not Microsoft!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Compact, fast & intuitive. Read multiple file-type efficiently."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is somewhat comparatively complex but if you manage it, it is a good alternative of MS office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Previous review disappeared - developer responded? Recent versions unable to open many docx files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Love this app, never fails and is simple to use. 2 thumbs way up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Everything I need"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Sucks the upgrade is for just 1 lousy tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app for everything. Now I only use it to take notes. All the useful stuff that was free for me to use all costs something now. The change happened the moment I updated."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely rubbish! It doesn't work in my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Gd but I can't see the keyboard if I use desktop display"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I am not allowed to make a PDF. That seems very jailware-ish. Looks like I will be better off drafting a legal document in my e-mail to share as a printed off .PDF for filing with a court..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Using the app for first time on my Nokia ""something or other"" sorry just know it's a little bit old (probably archaic to some) anyway....... Extremely handy for when I am out and about, popping in to cafes etc and get the odd idea for a story I am working on (if my phone is not playing up at the time). I do keep forgetting to give it a title so that I can access it later though üòÇ. Still a little hide and seek when I get home is fun. Keep up the good work üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Muy buena opci√≥n"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful piece of software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is so so good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Still a new user of this app. Seems easy to use on the small phone screen. I'm use to the Open Office menu structure, so it wasn't a big learning curve for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"App Features are good. But Even After installing so many Malayalam ttf fonts the words are not showings correctly. Pls rectify the problem. Pls give support for indian Malayalam language ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This free ware is great. I have been using the spreadsheet portion extensively and have no issues with its function. Thank you very much for providing it for android systems."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"awful. Somehow it co-opted Adobe Acrobat and only produced gobbledygook."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oh dear that was a very good idea for me to get a little bit of the same thing as I said I would have to do it now and then we can do something else for the weekend with the photos of the fridge in the bathroom and the young ones are in the same place as the other one.üá¨üáßüòéü¶Üüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Been using this for a long time - suddenly I need to pay to upgrade to save my existing files under a new name üò°"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Meh. Why open in read only mode? Ask me, huh?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very good apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Cluttered and slow... Even slower now... Has improved and getting better..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent office suit for my chrome book"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible app Can never read anything"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What gives? All of a sudden I've got the standard Open Office menus with no way to call up the onscreen keyboard. Which makes the application TOTALLY USELESS. How can I get the toggle for the keyboard back as part of the main menu? UPDATE: Don't use Native Mode or Desktop Mode. You'll lose the use of the Android controls like I did. Toggle them on if you're using a physical keyboard only."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice, but column with options can't properly shown"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is somehow good app for learners of computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work well at all"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Some differences from 'Office' but once you get used to it, its brilliant."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I like it - it's the only thing I've found that will open .odt files on a mobile device - but it's tricky to use on a small phone screen so I rarely use it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, has essentially every function of Open Office, but as a mobile app. No complaints. There is one function that would be nice to have added (but is in no way necessary for full capabilties.) Personalization options! For example in the desktop version you can make the entire background, tool bar, etc, have multiple different looks (I especially like the 'dark mode'-esque options). Other than that no notes!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very good because make the presentation is very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love using local storage for writing!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I wish tablets come in size 15 inches"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app for practice in the phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Application does not edit file, I only get to edit a copy of it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've always loved OpenOffice and LibreOffice and this is an excellent mobile version with most of the functionality of the desktop version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Why do I have ""insufficient user rights""? ""AndtOpen Office 5.4.0 Error saving the document Untitled: Object not accessible due to insufficient user rights."" Umm, not to be a jerk or anything, but why would I need user rights to save a document I worked on for so long?? Will change rating when fixed. Edit: 4/4/24 I did as the responder Akikazu Yoshikawa suggested and it appears that it is doing really really well so I have upgraded my rating from one star to four. I think this app is evolving!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Wouldn't be without it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Much too invasive ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"why is the mouse scroll inverted?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good excel alternative. Reliable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not what I was looking for in an office suite..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I can't seem to upgrade to the pro version within the app.. clicking 'professional version' yields nothing. Help."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Used for claiming Gift Aid very useful as my New Laptop will not let me download Open Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been with Open Office for 10 years. It has and still is a great program to use!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use it for checkbook balancing. Works well for me. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good for my needs. I have the free version cannot edit anything (openoffice thing) on cloud but can view. Can edit any OO files on phone or SD card. Have to work out procedure but ok once you do. Must remember to save everytime you look at another file or when you go back changes are lost, but that is not difficult"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"too many ads disrupt use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Been using AndrOpen Office a long time. I have to admit it works easier on a PC. But, when you are away from your PC this works fine."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My wife and I have been using open office for years. AndrOpen Office for tables and phones is just as good,."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good experience for many years now. My use is for me, no longer sharing since retirement."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Ads completely erased my working progress during my session by reloading an app when the ad was over. Happened first time tho'"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Although using AndrOpen Office on a modern phone is not the easiest thing... It is doable when you need to edit a document etc. and don't have a laptop or desktop available."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Once you get used to it's traits (weird UI, Android limitations, some limited functions unless you pay for PRO license - which I do), there's a really high chance you'd get your job done within this app quite easily. Just don't forget to export as multiple formats to ensure document compatibility across devices! (I recommend using it on Android 6-10 to experience the app at its peak (and gain access to the Bibliography DB, Base APP, etc.))"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app Please update for higher android versons"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Paid for pro version still has ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Horrible U.I. It nullifies every single positive point that could be mentioned... none of which are 5-star themselves."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is EXCEPTIONAL for those who enjoy creating with office and web development tools! The greatest part about it is that it's totally free and they do not harass you with emails and ads to extort money...like a LOT of companies do! AND so far I absolutely love EVERYTHING about it! OUTSTANDING JOB guys, in all honesty!!! I'll definately be donating in the future because of your loving kindness and generosity to the poor! Thank you and may God continue to bless you!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Hot Mess! No Refunds from Gplay the day after purchased. This is what you get when you port over a PC app & try to make it work on Android. After I dl & paid for premium ver., I got a system warning msg. saying ""YOU SHOULD PUT THIS APP IN DEEP SLEEP AND DON'T USE IT UNTIL THE DEVELOPERS CAN CORRECT THE BUGS IN THE PROGRAM."" GDrive crashed. I have a new Samsung Tab A9+. I was sick and tired of Microsoft's strangle hold over the 365 Orffice FREE CRIPPLE WARES, I jumped on OPENOFFICE. Oopsüò´@WPSüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well as a full page word editor on your phone. Navigation and lettering selection could do with a bit of improvement."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"keeps getting better"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was looking for a good office suite for Android. Many programs fall short. AndrOpen Office comes very close to a full desktop office suite. Worth every cent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great free app. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I want to like this app but until they sort out the interface I can't. It's clunky to have to select the keyboard every time you want to edit text. But worse, it is very buggy when using Google keyboard. Impossible to correct autocorrections or up select words. I hope they fix this and then I will use it again. For now I have downgraded to the free version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Useless, font issue during editing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Requires a password for an unprotected document. Has now turned to personal data mining. Uninstalling now"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Has features I can't find in Excel. Doesn't require you to login to use it or save changes, and doesn't hide work on the stupid cloud by itself. It's a little sluggish, colors could be better, but a great non micro soft app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app for what I use. However, advertisements always slow down my work process. I guess I can always pay for the ad-free version. At least I have an option."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"My mouse scroll-wheel scrolls in the wrong direction. Only with this app. All others are fine, but I cannot find a setting for it anywhere."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I paid for the pro version on Amazon Marketplace and it insists I keep the Amazon Marketplace app open on my phone. So I came to the play store and paid for the pro version again but it insists I pay again if I wish to use it on my tablet. It is a good app but greedy. I do not recommend the paid version because I cannot use it on my 2 devices even though I have paid twice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Popup ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"A fair office suite with issues. While a bit querky at times. For instance.. You cannot edit and save a file if opened by tapping the file/icon. Support informed me you can edit and save if the file is opened within the app. While help references using open office's site, they consider AndrOpen a 3rd party app not associated with them. Some controls, like the scrolls in pop-ups, tabs on a spreadsheet, etc., are so small that they are unusable. You can resize a document, but not controls."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use it a lot doc and spread sheets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Frustrating! I created an .odf spreadsheet in LibreOffice on my computer. Sent it to my phone to edit it while I am mobile. It would open the file in ""Read-Only"" mode; couldn't edit. The mobile app suggested saving a copy. Okay, fine. I opened the copy file - again, Read-Only mode! I searched the options for a clue - Nothing. I found no help online, either. I uninstalled the app. Collabora Office has the same ""engine"" as LibreOffice so I installed that app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great software that akways meets my needs,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Yet another add filled POS!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't print"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"love this app for many years. but recently lost my special menu, and cant get it back on top. plus the perm menu from the bottom is now on top, and cant change that."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Currently will not recognize or open password protected MS Office files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to understand and use, great tools, everything I need, on my phone and no need for laptop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time! It is 100% junk! All I wanted to do was change a number on a docx and it could not accomplish that!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An open source office suite that should be good for most people using android phones. It is a great development effort, and many thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well on Samsung Dex."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Is good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Needs a lot of work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"When I enter data in the spreadsheet and press tab to move to the next cell some of the text from the cell I am leaving is moved to the destination cells making data entry almost impossible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Difficult to read info easily ... as it jumps to one side as one pages thru document ... irritatingly so."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks for this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Tried several editors for ods, this was the only free one that worked for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is ok on phones with external monitor but there is a lot of potential for tablets. Please bring this on Huawei tablets. Google play is required if you download it as apk. It will not worked phones that is deGoogle or Huawei's Harmony OS"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's changed, not in a good way - the menu seems to have vanished. I preferred the previous version; how do I revert to it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great version fo tablet or phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Why this app shows as threat by m-kavach as malware ? Otherwise this is really good and provide all features but also with warning ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, it enables me to edit open office style documents on my tablet when I am not at my computer. So far it has been faultless. Well done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Incredibly slow on my Pixel 8 and Samsung Tab 5Se. Scrolling on a Word document is painful. Uninstalled. Don't pay for it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does what I need for notes and drafts"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Useful if you don't have a laptop, but the interface is cramped on smaller phone. Using a Samsung A14, lower end phone. Good enough for my needs. If you have a stylus is perfect."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Looks like a good app but I don't want to pay to view my docs on my phone currently"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years and I've tried another ones. No doubt it's the best free option for Microsoft office with full functions. Look at the plugins to add more and more options, fonts and so on !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"it's better but others things miss that's why I give 4 stars and I hope you'll improve it better next time"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am very surprised!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and will tell my friends about it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It more useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very usefulüôè"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unable to use this app, useless"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very very Useful. Great effort from It's creators. Try it you'l be glad. Any way we can't left aside the fact, that It is Free!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have used the Open 0ffice program for years and really appreciate all its features. I am glad to see that the tablet version has all the same features as far as I can tell. Using the app on the small tablet screen is a bit challenging however. (It's for this reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5.) When developing a new spreadsheet I find it better to build the sheet on my PC then upload to a Dropbox. I really appreciate having use of it on the more portable tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome application so helpfull. Just love it ‚ù§ You should also try. The best thing is that, it is free of cost üòáüòç. No need for Computer it's help me a lot thanks you AndrOpen Office ü©∑ü©∑"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good app on the PC. Unwieldy and unpleasant on the phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am an Ubuntu user and bought this app for word processing, which it does although it hass difference from Libre Office.(LO) better help file would be an advantage, also a way to remove highliting created in LO."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Does not allow to write text in a new text file. Good app just to read files, not create new or update existing files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Nice app More than I imagin But lag is the main issue suddenly the system close and stop working üòî"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Expensive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Andropen is the best for mobile software office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Among the similar programs that I have downloaded, even from the most famous brands in this field, your program is really the best in terms of performance, interface, and appearance. Until now, every tool I needed was available for free, but I don't know why the score Your program in Google Play is lower than many weaker programs, you are right, don't worry, it's great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I can't able to create database ü•≤"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I have been using this App and a desktop PC version with a database for years. Now I don't have any database available. I still use the spreadsheet and writer to open MS Office docs which work very well. I'd give it five stars for these."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I'm using it on my chromebook, works and feels almost like desktop version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great App, medium learning curve"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good app but is not compatible with version 1.3 of the odf"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like the app, it's really reliable"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Using mainly for spreadsheets. It lacks common fonts. I imported an xls from Win 10/excel. By doing so, I have Arial. If not, I'd have to use one the fonts the product came with. Most of which I've never heard of. (Android Clock??) The main book I work with has 5 sheets. Most of time (At least on this tablet) the book wakes up without the sheet selection bar at the bottom. One day, out of nowhere, the ""Format Cells"" function changed to a menu of sorts. A heads-up would have been nice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I now have to rate this as a 1 because I cannot get an answer as to a major bug that is making using this program extremely difficult. I have done a video screen capture of the problem and emailed it to tech support and cannot get them to address it. Many times when I hit space, the previous word is getting jumbled by some bizarre autocorrect bug. It makes typing long documents extremely painful. I don't understand why the author will not address this bug. I have the pay version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect. I found what i was looking for. I was trying to remove wps office from my phone and after using this app i did. The andropen office has impressive features like libreoffice. I love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"T iff jcd. Beec. 9"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very helpful for everyone. Unbelievable,smartness and many things"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is like open office. Org on mobile. Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"just began to use seems to try to give too much in toolbars, shal persevere with it for it does have potential ü§î"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app does exactly as I wanted"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It does not provides base"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not bad, but the screens are to crowded for mobile use.. the ads are rough. I get needing them for forcing timed limits on showing the ads was a deal breaker for me. I mean show the ad and give the the X to clear it. Not wait a time limit"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Constant crashes on various devices, especially when switching between apps. What happened to your products over the post 5 years now that they just persist."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice one"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Often freezes leaving you to lose your work. Randomly copies and pastes on its ownand unable to stop it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The results are unreadable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cant print in the free veraion of ""open office""."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"One of its kind? Probably yes but unfortunately it doesn't support the latest ODF 1.3:'( didn't think it would cause me a problem until I tried exporting a document as a PDF and the pdf was messed up (images on top of each other) so I really hope you guys gonna support 1.3 soon"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A decent office suite. Occasionally has a mind of its own. But does what I need it to do and nothing I do not."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app for opening and editing OpenOffice files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very happy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Grabs PDFs from mail, but cannot open them."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No need expensive office apps more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Edit2: Custom fonts don't work in Android 13, but Add Fonts do work. *** Old review: Great app, really useful in my business for editing documents and pdf invoices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very use for document editing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open Office Good is the"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Needed an app for spreadsheets, and this hits all my expectations. I use the desktop version and the transition from there to here is seamless. The app is intuitive (I love the toolbar being on the bottom where I can reach it!) and though it's a bit fiddly, the fact that it's competing with small screen makes this a tiny blip in comparison to the effortless functionality of the rest of the app. It just works. Best part: no getting shot halfway across the page when I click something."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Beautiful interface but useable. 1) new file created, text pasted, file saved 2) switched to other app to copy more text 3) switch to AndrOpen Office showed open file dialog 4) saved file opened 5) scrolled to end-of-file 6) pasted more text, saved 7) switched to other app, copied text, returned to AndrOpen 8) open file dialog displayed, again 9) this scenario played out dozens of times. 10) I switched to a simple text editor. WHEW! AndrOpen not ready, and no way would I purchase. Uninstaller."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"When another mobile office clone is not enough."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"* Pro: A little difficult to begin with, but once you get used to the interface, you can create fairly decent documents. * Pro: Very customizable. * Pro: Good tech support. *Pro: Will support most documents and can handle many directories (including remotes) * Con: A little unsuitable for presentations. * Con: Limited by android (10+ scope storage, no fix yet, limiting functionality) * Con: Weird UI, not designed for every form factor in mind. | It's decent enough for me, can make use of."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I can't use base in it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"WAwwwoooo"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Broken font Annoying adds"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good for use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"12/16/23. Help! I use this app daily but now it causes Drive to freeze. When I attempt to access Drive directly from app, it says ""general Internet error""??? Over the past 10 years I've become extremely reliant on this app in my daily professional & personal activities. Although ""clunky"" at times, it has proved to be the very best OpenOffice port to date. I've purchased the professional version for a couple of my devices and have no regrets. Thank you devs for your support of this excellent app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it! It's so convenient for my android tablet to have a document app and this one is my favorite!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using AndrOpen Office for a few years now. Personally I think it is a fantastic app. I use my Amazon 11th generation Fire Tablet with a wireless Fintie keyboard and a wireless mouse. I highly recommend it. I do word processing with this app for 3 - 6 hours a week and previously did for up to 12 hours a week. Oh, on extremely rare occassions I have had a random glitch, but no more than using MS Word on my PC and that was probably more the fault of my devices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I paid and upgrade to Pro on 13 dec 2022. Now when I click upgrade it does not recognise my purchase and charge me again. Please advise what happened and how can I get my money back?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Have paid version but can't edit existing files. Have to save as a different file name and change name after editing each time. Very annoying."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing when spreadsheet is saved"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Absolutely loved the UI and the feature available with word and Excel files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not perfect, but the best implementation of an office suite for an Android tablet I have seen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The app looks dated, but looks can be deceiving, as this app is almost as powerful as desktop office suites, while still being fast and lightweight. Kudos to the developers! However, please make it possible to open multiple files using this app as an ability to multitask is a must for power users. Also, please support ODF 1.3."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As database is not there"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Utter rubbish. You have to pay for the simpliest function."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Have not had any issues for my purposes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Reliable editing for OpenDocument files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I used to love this, but now it's really annoying. I upgraded to Pro and it still crashes and loses work if I leave the window for more than a couple of seconds. I've set it up to save every 1 minute, but it doesn't do so. I can't find anything, on Android, to replace it and seem to be stuck with it. But it infuriates me when I lose an hour' work, just because I moved to another window or application. I also find that the keyboard shorcuts tend to let me down."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"These open office-type app suites are so much better than MSOffice and you don't have to pay for them. LibreOffice for PC is definitely the best of them. AndrOpen Office is new and not so polished, but it's already more useful than Microsoft's offering, which can't even be downloaded. And the menus in MS Office are so effed up it takes time to sorthem looking for the tools you need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very worthwhile program/app indeed. With a little patience the app works with you rather than the other way round! The Windows Writer desk top version is a splendid learning platform for W/P as well as a pro one, and the mathematical nature of Draw has got me a lot closer to getting to grips with algebraic math at long last. Will give it a proper go very soon. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app. Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not working"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A perfect package for the desktop office suite experience in a mobile app. Stable, reasonably fast and responsive, and powerful. All things considered I can't even complain about the ad frequency. More than fair for the functionality."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good Application Overall"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good to work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"An app of garbage. I cannot type anything in it , presentation window doesn't even open in it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, working satisfactoryüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"You will lose data. Several times, this app has lost data in a simple spreadsheet. I can no longer trust any critical data with it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great word app! just what i was looking for. paragraph editing seem to be missing tho and you are also missing (Arial) - font format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Just occasionally using it it is premature to evaluate it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"We cannot write Bangla language properly. It brock or saparate the words. Please fix it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, compatible with Apache for writing and reading"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"FREEZE SOMETIMES, ZOOM CHANGE ALSO THE MENU AND SHOULD NOT DO THAT, TRY TO CHANGE THE SIZE OF COLLUMS OR LINES WITH A MOUSE IS ALMOST IMPOSIBLE"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Temu"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good, but too many advs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very useful for me and I will be able to make my own presentation"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow available in android now Yeh!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Recently, if I create a document and save it, then come back to it later and save it again, all the edits I make in the second session are lost. Input from a Bluetooth keyboard is unpredictable, adding capitalisation plus lowercase to the start of the word. I am now regretting paying for the pro version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Didnt work for me on very old android tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this program. No criticism comes to mind."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Got the pro Version. Works great on my tablet. Update after some time experiencing the app. I am impressed about the functionality it offers on my android tablet! Can do most of the work I used to do on my laptop. An improvement could to line up the menu's with libreoffice menu tabs which would make it even more user friendly if you change from one machine to the other."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Long story short. In my case, I love it. On my laptop, and my Samsung tablet. (I can use the mouse) And is free and compatible with the other EXPENSIVE ONE"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The only task I tried to use this app for failed. I was unable to access a form needed for medical information. All attempts arrived at ""Read Only"". Bye"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Free and Easy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love open office. I regularly share documents between my phone and laptop. Since I use open office there also, I can seamlessly open docs on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Too old, doesn't support newer open document format odf 1.3. I'll try another app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't edit some open office documents. Spell check didn't work. Help function didn't work. Clicked on help and it just closed the document without saving. Paid ¬£12.99 to upgrade to ""pro"" version. That was the version all of the above happened. Asked for a refund and didn't even get a reply. Have had to delete the app as it is useless to me. Avoid this app and just use Google Docs for free instead."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've used Open Office word processor on my desktop computer for years. It does everything I need it to do. I'm trying Open Office on my tablet, and it seems just fine."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just what I had been looking for."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best Office Suite, Great replacement for MS Office. Simple to use with all the features of MS Office & Goggle Office. Works on the computer, tablet, & phone. Stored on the computer, no need for interweb connection! Ability to store documents in MS Office or Google formats. This allows file sharing with non-Open Office people, with no format changes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"doesnt open a ods file correctly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great for my phone and very versatile."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very Very poor bad more bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Waste"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good, but ot for a phone screen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Still the best office suite I've used on Android. Requires effort to learn work arounds and works best with a keyboard and mouse, but after trying lots of Office suites including the MS Office apps, this is the only app that provides a good experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far really good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Installed on my 10"" Acer tablet (+USB keyboard and mouse). Surprised to find that after I'd paid the one-off ¬£12.99 (-note how cheap, Microsoft!) the program truly allowed access to OneDrive and Google Drive as promised; I loaded and saved files successfully. Only had a few hours play so far, but it is truly a pleasure to use, especially as I can customise the toolbars to my heart's content."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"As far as WinWord alternatives go, it's fairly alright (hence why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1). My problem is that it can't just open my files properly, instead having to open a copy because of ""missing permissions"" or some such BS. If that weren't bad enough, it insists on saving files in .odt format even when I expressly choose a different format. To top it all off, when I try to open the file on my computer, half the time I get an error message, saying the file is corrupted. Awful!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works quite well if file is not password protected. Will not open excel file that is password protected. I have not put passwords on other types of files, so not sure about Word or Powerpoint docs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app on Google play for .odt files. And converting most documents to PDF."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Frequently hangs my Android cell phone, sometimes requiring a reboot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"23rd 44t is fine for 2"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's a bit fiddly on a tiny screen but workable for me as I use LibreOffice on my desktop/laptop also."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent Adaption of Open Office. This application represents hardwork to adapt ""Open Office"" to the Android platform. I'm able to have a full working ""desktop"" app by mirroring on a TV or monitor and using a mouse. Or, editing and writing on a smartphone. On the small platform, working knowledge of Open Office will enable better use of this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ultra Pro App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I don't know how to use it and this app should have better FEATURES"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is great port of open office, could you also make inkscape, gimp or libre office ported and simply like thi? Many thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice app for data entry."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very helpful to me Thank you .. üí´‚ô•Ô∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The experience with a keyboard and mouse set is superb! On the other hand, I did not like the UI interaction using the touchscreen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"formatting 1.3 odf documents well. but scrolling, wellbthe whole ui is tedious, as are the many, many ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Documents education"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Great attempt. This may work for some people. However the user interface is extremely cluttered."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice. One of the best open app that is free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It actually tells me what file and it's full path I am currently working on and saving to."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Isme database to h he nhi"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"hard to save document"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The interface is weird"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally what i needed! Also no invasive sponsors. 5/5"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's almost exactly what I'm looking for to replace google docs for writing on my phone, but its missing a key feature: could you please implement a dark mode? I don't know why so few text editing apps bother with it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Mostly works very well and is compatible with the PC version of Open/Libre Office. Panning around a spreadsheet with an area selected tends to be sluggish, and selecting an area larger than the screen can be quite awkward. Overall, however, it provides an effective Android version of the PC offering."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this very much because of presentation"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Piacevolmente simile nell'uso ad OO per pc. Ben fatta e utilissima la simulazione del mouse. Se il display √® abbastanza grande √® come usare il pc. @Dr. SAAIE KB: I entered =SUM(A1:A60) very easily. You simply select the function SUM in the desired result cell, then you specify the cell list instantly by swiping the inherent area on the sheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ive noticed a thing happening with app's where for 1 reason or another ur forced to update...with this 1 it just poofed from my device ja odd..So I thought just go down it again...from there it's just been bad! App which is or should be the same but it's NOT! It's always saying there is something wrong with my doc's and it has problems saving..even when there is plenty of space! O I just found this 1 out after writing a long doc that if u chang screens then come back it reloads/does NOT save!>_<"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its a good apps..easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"ok use must be familiar with office type software."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Helpful on quickly setting up lists in spread sheet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have used OpenOffice for desktop and find this to be a good familiar application to perform the same needs. I only wish this supported ODF 1.3 to be more compatible with LibreOffice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Used it for years... A bit slow opening, but great..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Downloaded changed document so I can not print nor open in another app. Now, I am held hostage for buying upgrade to print."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly, having very good features."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Longlife offline"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I use OpenOffice on my laptop, and am satisfied THERE. Though happy to find a word-processing app for a tablet, I'm not over-impressed with its performance. On several occasions, it hasn't let me save a document. (This seems - ironically - to happen less when saving one as a .doc file than as OpenOffice' own .odt format!) At other times, the app won't even open properly, and I have to reboot. It has also been annoying to search for functions which are easy to find on the computer version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Stress free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It didn't work for me. Too many glitches. Edit: The files won't open and it just shows a pure black screen even after restarting the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS OFFICIALLY DECLARED AS STUPID. IT CURRENTLY HOLDS THE WORLD'S RECORD FOR HANGING FOOLISHLY. I WON'T ADVICE MY WORST ENEMY TO DOWNLOAD IT"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I needed an alternative to Google Docs. Not the best, it does what I need it to do, which is type and do spreadsheets. A bit of an outdated look giving me Office 95 vibes, which isn't bad by any means, and has a slight lag when I do certain things, but overall it gets the job done. I also love I don't have to manually set something to be worked on offline, though I do have to find something else for spellcheck. Probably won't need to look for an alternative for a while with the AI stuff."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"beter than that other one for a lot less money $0 this is opensource"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent product and easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome office app, it does everything thing I need. Well worth upgrading to the pro version."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy and precise"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent software & now an excellent app that I've used for over 10 years. Able to create and open up documents and spreadsheets received from or sent to Microsoft Office Suite. I thank GOD for AndrOPEN OFFICE!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good, after I figured how to use it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Soooper!!!üëçüëçüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As good as a slightly old version of msft office, but free !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Hard to navigate."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome. But it didn't support malayalam fond Yet now didn't add Malayalam font"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I expected to get the same interface as the Windows version and I did -- sort of. They have done a wonderful job of squeezing the Windows interface into the confines of the Android screen along with making the same functions available on the toolbar and menus without the benefit of a mouse. It takes a little bit of work to figure everything out when using the app to create a simple spreadsheet on my Moto Edge the first time, but it can be done! I highly recommend this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"overrides plug and play"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Reasonably good although I have not yet figured out how to delete files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I loved it until it came time to print and I got the message that printing not available unless you upgrade to the paid version! What a con job. It also appears to have changed the row formatting on a table and I am unable to change it back. Let me out of here."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A very good & useful application. I am considering to purchase it but for small perfection required. I tried =SUM() function. It requires me to enter all cell addresses instead =SUM(A1..A60). CUMBERSOME to enter 60 or more cell addresses. PLEASE IMPROVE. I will buy & will give 5*. Further, when value in a cell is changed, sum is not getting updated automatically. Make it perfect. I need to use it for charts also that I am yet to try."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sangat membantu"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Useable but slow to pan and expand. App closes and destroys changes. Can't find Conditional Formatting. BUT, the best feature is not having to login to do anything as with excel. Also, AO doesn't save to the cloud without permission. Work sites don't always have Wi-Fi or cell service."

AndrOpen Office works well with LibreOffice, so I can do my work on my tablet, save it to Drive, and open it in my laptop. This is a HUGE asset! (It's not perfect, but it's good enough for what I need!)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's so helpful for me"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was using it well and fine, something happened, let me reinstall,l it ,it's working fine since I am using it as my default office app, This with a bit different interface we may need to learn a bit , touch system should be refined similar to other editors, instead of invoking touch pad mouse combination"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent alternative excel."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good opened a RAR file and saved it as normal file full screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exciting app. I chanced on it while researching office apps for a senior colleague of mine. He loves it and I also love it. I hope to pay for it soon, because it is worth it. The ads that capture my screen can sometimes be annoying, but well worth the app. After all, money and effort went into the app and have to be paid for. That's why I will pay for it. Kudos guys!üëçüèæüëçüèæüëçüèæ"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A very useful app for you on a mobile device much prefer to Ms word. Not perfect, a few little glitches. Learning curve is not bad at all if you've used other apps. overall a really good app. Main drawback I have found is that there doesn't seem to be online support or user forum"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Prefer previous version. Copy and paste was easy, now it us not."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best office experience on Android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I use OpenOffice on my pc all the time, it's free but androffice is not totally free. Hard to work with. I will grade this as junk."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice but not perfect. I found there are some PDF docs it will not open. It tries then exits out of the software. Also slow to load docs compared to other programs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Works well on the Z Fold4."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its too basic makes me think its an app that just wants permission to access your docs. Do not give that permission Having to delete the app to cancel out the permissions dont trust it at all"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have writtem about 2 - 3 pages and then its make me out and said to upgrade . Its so glitchy and and always asking for paid version."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good but some of toolbars are not included when compares to laptop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's doesn't even get Installed.. ! I'm trying from past 1hr and still nothing happens.. Hate this app .!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"May be worth the expense of upgrading if I used it more. Rarely use it. Only use it for small spreadsheets and quick word docs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've been using open office for years and I recently find the app awesome!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I purchased premium version. I have just one problem, atleast for the time being, it cannot write Arabic from right to left. I've also sent an email to the address you mentioned. As per message, I sent an email to the developer's address but has not get any suitable reply despite a period of a month or so."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"With this app you can oompletely format your book on an android tablet. That is, you can set up mirror margins. (Also known as the gutter.) Neither google docs or ms office can do this."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"–¢–æ, —á—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–¥–æ!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just found this app. So far it's great, will probably do the upgrade as its reasonably priced unlike so many others. Well done üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"keeps cutting out halfway through something you're trying to do loses all the work you have done, which means you have to restart everything again"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I've used Open Office for several years. Overall it is a great replacement Office suite. The UI is sometimes cumbersome and non-intuitive. It's particularly challenging on Android phones. It would be helpful if it emulated more MS office commands (without exceeding thresholds that would constitute an intellectual property rights violation)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not such a good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Extremely functional and simulates the pc experience. Advanced & respectable office App."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Latest update has text recognition issues and will not work properly please fix this problem as soon as possible so that your users are able to fully use the document writer program before the latest update"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Please provide ""TOUCH AND DRAG left or right"" option to widen cells,Its difficult to increase width of cell by long pressing and finding an option to make those wide again and again,thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app has been consistent, dependable, versatile, high quality, sufficiently multifunctional, and compatible for years. It can exemplify the standard by which other document office apps measure and strive. Excellent results and Commendable app designers and administrators."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have experienced (yesterday) writing something (I paid for app...), Screen sleeping and phone waking with content typed lost and it not having been saved... So save your work over and over and over and over and... Or lose your work. Immensely frustrating! Turn your head to speak to a friend and everything is gone forever & you must type it all again... Ughhh. Just do so at home and only open here would be smartest way to go..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,".xlsx file becomes reformed using across excel and AndrOpen Office, please help."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fantastic ( but needs to retain stuff if you switch apps ( you've got to remember to save before switching apps))"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I opened an OO template which had a black text box containing a white font. Everything else was fine, except that white font which was not visible (probably changed to black). I have sent the documents requested by the developer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OK once you get used to it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best of best!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best free office suite available, been using it for years on PC, now on Android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very versatile and powerful. Trustworthy open source reliability. Smaller phone screen requires very delicate finger work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app! Thank you so much!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The search function is extremely glitchy. I tried to type four letters into the search box (of a ~150-page .odt file), and only three letters appeared. Then, letters started slowly disappearing and then reappearing in the search box, and I couldn't get any control over this. What's more, the phone's keyboard *froze* on the screen as this was happening, and it stayed there frozen even after I quit the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to use on a phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app.easy to use very functional"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I seem not able to open even just one file with this app.üò™"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's glitching"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally i got an office that fits well for my chromebook. I have tried many office suites and they deliver; but AndrOpen Office is the most convnient, easy and reliable office suite that i have ever used. It seems that i am using Microsoft Office 98. But i am okay with that because it gets all my job done i just want to get my job done and this office suite does it quiet smarty & easily. All excel functions and formulas are available. All word processing features are also available. Thank you!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office app for android I've used."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A few little bugs but communication from developer says they are working on them and making app top notch which I have to agreee. App is a deal if you buy the Pro one time purchase. Has met my advanced user expectations. 5 star next time..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"There is no way to buy it because it's not being sold in US or Philippines. Its an ok app but the ads are very annoying. I really enjoy desktop mode with keyboard and mouse support. Before I found out about this mode it was really difficult to use. Once in a while there are issues popping up like freezing. No ideal how to repeat those error because I would post it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"not free. Can't do anything. Absolutely rubbish"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"ü•∞ü•∞"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Much like using openoffice on my windows machine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I'm very much happy to use this app since it's user friendly and reliable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app useful for me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is a good app for learning"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Finally a phone app that lets you use Libreoffice on a phone! It still has some glitches. Shifting to another app without saving first causes me to lose data, for instance. And it would still be nice if I could use my own macros. Still, it's great to be able to carry my spreadsheets with me into the field."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"My Chromebook makes this app look strange and not as usable as does Microsoft."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app !! ""Mini me"" excel."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"While opening some document from ms word or excel, some contents are it cannot show in andropen office. Please improve this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this app has all the features that you could want. it even has a help section."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used the app and I encountered some challenges. whenever I work on a spreadsheet on Excel and I merge cells together, when I reopen the app to continue work on that same sheet I was working on, the merged cells closes back to default so this bug be fixed and this application is going to be the very best, thank you. I have used the app for many years and I really have been enjoying it. Thanks so much to andropen Company."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app on my 8 inch tablet. I've been using it for a few years now on my phone and a couple years on my tablet. That said , I recently had to reinstall it on my tablet and now I have no access to storage. I have granted permission in app settings but it is still blocked. I can't access my files or save any new files. This ,akes this app Unusable. Any help will be appreciated."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The app looks so old fashioned. It's features looks kind of primitive i mean i can't use in on my phone , on laptop maybe. I have actually used other apps like docs . And Google take notes those are good for basic note taking ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office on my cellphone and tablet is very important to me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Used once. Looks great. Will know more later."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use LibreOffice, so it was actually easy for me to go through all the navigations and options so far"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very slow and unfriendly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ideal app for office work. I'd say even better than the Ms office apps for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful and effective."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Almost everything you need to publish a book that exists in Open Office, (Eg. mirror margins) exists in this app. The only problem is you get periods where letters echo. Turning off wifi etc doesn't stop the problem. It eventually goes away on its own."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Finally an Office Suite App that works well on my Chromebook. Works just like the Win ver. of Apache O.O. Pro version allows you to save files to SD card, Brilliant! Great for working offline. Tried a lot of the various Office suite apps, most want to zing you with a Monthly or Yearly charge to use for an unlocked ver. of all the features..Not! Just a tad slow in opening a new file type but thats ok this way."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot. It does everything I need to create and edit documents. Having said that there is an issue with the keyboard - the left and right arrow buttons in the lower right corner that allow you to move the cursor left and right through the text don't seem to work. This means you have to place the cursor exactly where you want it in order to edit the text. This is difficult and tedious. I paid for the upgrade and this is basic functionality. Please fix and this would be a 5 star app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Pretty good experience but envelope formating is a little tricky using Android tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpen Office reads many file types very well. [IF you use the excellent Libre Office and you run it under Linux then you may know your default file formats are not easily handled by others.] This app CAN read ODT and other files Very WELL - truly a fine rendition of Open Office. On an inexpensive (low power) model of a tablet, the larger screen makes everything quite readable. My hardware won't leave skid marks on a desk, but this software is great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Hahaha... YouTube brought me here..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Totally useless unless you pay for an allegedly free app that has ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I love this program on my desktop and laptop, but cannot use it on my android cel phone. When opened it has cursor (text mode) but a separate large 'cursor' is on screen wherever i touch screen. No keypad ever appears. Most i can do is to paste some copied text from elsewhere, then save that (using top menu bar which does respond) without any reformatting. I am trying to find another program (for this cel phone) i like as well as i like this one used on desktop. Sorry"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It mostly works. Most small ODS files integrate OK on Android and Mac. Android only shows a small portion of the spreadsheet and it's too easy to inadvertently destroy formulas with no way to escape. Thus, I only modify duplicated files. I don't work on large, complex spreadsheets on Android. Those are Mac only. Big snafu with Android is when clicking off Open Office to do another task, the document closes on return without saving. It has to be saved before clicking off."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've still got my android phone that I signed my Apache licence, please make it free for me, thank you Google."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is a Just Right non-MS Office that functions exactly like MS Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"If it went past the 3 coloured dots I could have gave a review but it didn't."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Third class"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is a dream app. I have every possible option, feature and setting I loved in Microsoft Office and/or Libre Office for Linux. I am still amazed that this is an Android app because it is not cut down in any way, shape or form. I am very imoressed. It works well on my cheap small tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Odious ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"1 GB free and the useless junk won't update? That's okay, I shall uninstall this junk app then."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"printed work not available in free version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"So good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Make letter upto 400 it has only 96 size"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"üö´ editing options......not working...feak..app,....total paid app üö´"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I find it better to use than word is."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"There doesn't seem to be a way to cancel a subscription to this app~ I have tried and failed, so buyer beware"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Re :previous 19.03can't insert text in AOO.After some messing about it seems like I can just about do anything to selected text except type and adjust page size.Also the keyboard doesn't show Ok last resort uninstall/reinstall.seems to be back to normal"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"My keyboard doesn't appear on my screen if I put my cursor in the document"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Destroyed a lot of my data coming from the desktop libreoffice. Will take a long time to get over."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's a good app to create and edit .odt. .ods, etc. files. It usually hides the blinking Android cursor, so I can see what I'm writing and what I've written, which is harder when apps don't hide the blinking. Unfortunately it isn't well-suited to keyboard control and I keep having to reach for the touchscreen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good suite of programmes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"how in the world do you bring the keyboard up for editing a document in writer. It seems this did function at one time. I have tried Save As for documents thinking the Original is Read Only. Can not show keyboard"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cannot get text to enter. Can I uninstall and reinstall? Changed from Grammerly keyboard to Sakmsung keyboard. Problem solved."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Used to work great on my old phone. Now It can't find existing excel files. frustrating!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The recent files section does not remember my recent files. Not intuitive. No dark mode. Ads Galore every time you open or close a file"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.. üòÉ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great, simple, very close to MS word."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good enough but the Impress is not working properly even split cells command is not present in Calc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Almost all you need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Seems to be a great app. All needed functionality is crippled unless you pay. I bought paid version but this should be labled as crippleware untill fee is paid. It is NOT free for other than examination of functions. Can not be used for productivity unless money is paid. I will change my rating to 5 star if the description is more transparent in the very first part of the description."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The updates on this app is so confusing, I updated the app on the 18th of February 2023, on the 20th it wanted me to update it again for the update that was done on it on the 7th of February 2023. How confusing üò±"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app. I've been wondering how many tasks that I use a PC for could be done on my S23 using Samsung DeX. Got the Spreadsheet open & displaying on my monitor. The problem is opening the phone's on screen keyboard to edit entries. Samsung says the keyboard opens automatically when an editable entry is double tapped. It doesn't in the Spreadsheet. I opened 'Samsung Internet' for a test. Double tapping on its search window does open the keyboard. I can hardly complain but a fix would be nice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads Ads Ads and more Ads. Not worth it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cannot edit at all"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great addition for any Chromebook. Insert a microSD card for external storage, and the chromebook becomes an inexpensive replacement for a laptop. Could read/write all of my math courseware I developed using Open Office on Linux, 12yrs ago (now long retired). I am using the Impress module for fitness workout slideshows. Worth purchasing the pro version for no ads, extra fonts, and ability to read/write to Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud services."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use open office for windows on my PC. This app, the one for Android gives compatable files and is a good clone of the PC package."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works perfect on my cheap tablet. Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst app in the world"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Feel compelled to comment on this app: fantastic! Just fantastic!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Supereasy to work with."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Much better than the other Android Office apps tried: familiar interface and easier access to cloud storage. EDIT: I complained about blocky icons but the Dev pointed out the Scaling setting on the opening screen that resolves that. Minor gripe: Dialog offering to convert an Opened file created in .docx format to OpenOffice format that appears on the first Save of every session is a bit annoying and not needed as Save As will do this. Easy to opt to retain original format though"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ease of use was great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent cross device compatibility. I can work from my phone as well as PC. Reads and writes word docx files as well as excel spreadsheets. Definitely worth purchasing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like most new products, it started out a bit glitchy, but they stayed with it and kept improving. Now it works great, and is my go to app for mobile editing. Go Aki Go!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easier to use then MS Office which I can not afford. It has all the programs I need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Intuitive, and with same functionality as open office. Avoid being further locked into google or microsoft products, and their orwellian marketing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have found this product to be exactly what I wanted. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Coll app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads while trying to read documents at work is horrible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"unable to locate a javascriptengine! this is not a good sign. some things work as expected, others do not. it hasbeen this way for over a year with no sign of improvement!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Is this OpenOffice or not? Because OpenOffice is free and doesn't have ads. And it is impossible to upgrade even though I wouldn't want to upgrade because it should be a free service"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Awful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect substitute for Microsoft and a lot cheaper."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is not good to much bugs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Needs 1 thing... Cannot swipe or scroll through tabs. You must use the left and right arrows. Minor issue but I have excel sheets with 10 or 15 tabs. With this app you'll never need Microsoft products again on your android device. No subscription."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Can't do students rank"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Just getting picky here because this is the best office-like app in the Android world. Please, please, please! Add parentheses to the numeric keyboard as this would simplify writing formulas ;) by not having to switch back and forth between alphabetic and numeric keyboard. It was weird but pleasant to have the PC type of dialogs on android, although there's room for improvement: popup dialogs are not scaled/optimised for phone's screens."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly and promote to many ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used AndrOpen Office since its initial distribution and I am impressed. Nevertheless, I highly recommend an ocassional peek at the help file."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its been a pleasure to mention to the developer who created this app, which made possible for me to use when my lap Top crashed to death. I would have rate it a 5 star but there is one product that is missing in the mso word editing which is the word office paint. It might be included where i might be mistaken, but advice where to locate it so i can use it. But otherwise well done creator of this mso app. Thanks, Gunn Sarwan PNG."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"very poor app and very difficult to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's a really good app. I liked it but still there are some things that don't work properly like the presentation slide. When I open it and use it, it stops working again and goes back to option menu"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love it and I love it and it looks really good night and the sizes works good thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best experience I have had in attempting to use an android touchscreen version of a spreadsheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Paid for version. Revised from two stars. Earlier review was a but premature. This is a very powerful and a complete replacement for the Msoft office suite. Fiddly on a tablet until you get used to its foibles. Link it up to a keyboard and mouse and its fine even better on a large screen, in fact no different than Xcel. It is now one of my essential must have apps along with Xplore and Samba Player."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It does all it says on the box, but the smaller your screen the more difficult it is to use! Keyboard use, and selection are cludgy, and the toolbar icons almost incomprehensible. Extreme care is needed not to corrupt your work by accident!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"this is a great app! I love to work with the dektop interface using DEX in my Samsung tab. I just wish we could be able to edit .docx documents since using the old format will really mess up some documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üëÜüèªüëåüèªüëçüèª"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just like its big brother on my desk top!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Handy for small jobs. Use a BT keyboard.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"When the word document is embedded with an Excel chart, it cannot be opened successfully by this application. I think that this problem could be solved without much difficulty in future update. Please take a look at this. Regards"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Looks good. Seems to do all I needed Microsoft Office to do. Yes I am a fan of this program. The more I use it, the better she be! The recent black screen problem was quickly fixed by update 4.9.2 and the program appears back to its excellent self. I confirm now after a number of months, AndrOpen Office has functioned faultlessly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Just started to use this and am impressed. it is not perfect but quite well done already. Wonder why i can't get the ugrade though. selecting the UPGRADE on top right or Detail or bottom right words doens't do anything. In the ADD-ON 'tab', the 1st item in list is pro ver (i assume it is upgrade), nothing happens with that too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works very consistently like the desktop version. The UI could be a bit more suited to touch screen input (vs. mouse & keyboard)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Regarding the file permissions issue previously mentioned, it occurs when using the recent files links. If one goes directly back to the default directory or unlinks and traverses the tree, the file will open read-write. Always save work. Include->file does not work. This is a pain when assembling a larger document from files. The only alternative is cut and paste. After several iterations of that, opening a series of files, an error message process already exists is displayed. Must restart"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Aggressive ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Difficult on a small screen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Priety cool. I love the facts that dictionary can be found on it. The only Ni is its display exceed the measurement criteria of my tablet. I have to adjust it manually. I doesn't self adapt to the screen, otherwise auto adjustment control. All the rest are finely working on task."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is useless, I tried making a small table to keep track of some items, and you can only do one thing, and then have to close and the advertising grabs control of tha tablet, and you to close the tablet, and reopen it, then you can one more and thing, and repeat. it took me 4 hours of fighting with it list 5 items. This is totally unacceptable for an open app. I have open office on my computer and it does not do that on the computer. Not recommended except to display a table already built"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No internet no functionality. Forget"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A remarkably good attempt to put a full office suite on Android. Still not quite practical on a small phone screen, some of the interface is just too small for adult fingers, but I'm sure it will improve."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice buy my phone is hanging when ever i open the app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is a good app but lack a lot of functions, if you mistakenly delete a page you can not return it and very difficult to edit book."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"needs documentation"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"But cannot pest. Why ?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's really works nice.i can open & work on files easily."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Very slow to start. Very, very slow to open a document and also to start creating a document. Ads to start and ads to end. And any features need money. Certainly nothing like the free Office type software like Libre Office or Open Office. This one is a money grabber!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's ok but still needs work. I can't adjust line spacing because there is no format, paragraph, spacing like the regular program has. Why not make this app LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE computer program? It can be easily done and would make perfect common sense."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works pretty good. A couple of display fit issues on my phone, better on my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great to have a full port of OpenOffice to Android! Mostly works amazingly well for everything I need it to. Thank you for the recent update fixing the spreadsheet freeze/scroll. Everything is back to being excellent! :-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It would be nice if I could read any of the .odt files previously created with Open Office. All documents are just pages of #############, and nothing more. What happened to this app?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app I've used it on subfloor of my computer's and I really enjoy it it's the professional yet user-friendly application thank you so much."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app most closely mimics OpenOffice and LibreOffice. It lacks the database app; however, it fully supports writing, spreadsheets, presentations, vector drawing, math/formula type setting, and building/maintaining true templates. It also support the full line of both MS and ODF file types including password protections. No other app does so much for free. That said, buy the pro upgrade to support someone who is doing fantastic work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"expl. as done, works but very clumsily so as if a ton of uselessly programmed software has to be moved for each action, but above all Android's provider's outrageous conditions have become indigestible (!!!)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best OO for Android, easily."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"In the middle of my entry the app froze and I lost everything that i had typed in over the past 4 hours. This is ridiculous."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Still learning it's many details. There are some minor connection issue so far. Very good for the price."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolute junk. Totally non intuitive. Puts a shaded block over part of the document that can be moved but not removed. Saves document, never to be found again. Many other bad issues. Steer clear of this garbage."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works really well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app . It's open all kind of files. Waouh! üëåüèæüëåüèæüëåüèæü§∏üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"can't open a file with it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been a fan for 25+ years, as it has evolved of course. Thank you and paying the great price after all bills are paid."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great OpenOffice app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not bad! Could be easier to select, cut, and paste within a document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Hello, just installed it in my Tab A7. It worked great with my bluetooth keyboard and thus far am satisfied with it. However, is there any possibility of having times roman or times new roman font added to its font selectoon?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office is the best business software on the market without all the political BS that comes with Windows and Microsoft."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good option to MS Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow really it's the best appüëè"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this. It works flawlessly. I use open office on my PC and was ever so happy to see it available for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I'm using excel program/function and it's works good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this app actually quite great, compare to other free office apps such as WP* or POLAR** office apps, only if you don't mind the old style, seems like microsoft office 2000/2003 UI with those icon, although microsoft word on pc was better to use with their tool and function, i do think this app seems like lite version of microsoft office and still great to use on android when compare it to other free version of office app, although you might want to upgrade it so you can access to cloud file"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This looked really good. I opened a LibreOffice document from my local network, edited it in AndrOpen Office. Then I saved my work. But when I came to look at it again, I couldn't find it. My original document was unchanged, and AndrOpen Office claimed Ihad no recent documents. All that work appears to be lost. Did I do something wrong? On further investigation, it looks like this was a file format issue. AndrOpen Office apparently cannot edit .odf 1.3 files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's lagging when I open an excel workbook. And I have 8 GBs of ram."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I paid for subscription months ago, but, now, it indicates that i am in free mode and keeps me showing ads. I restricted some google functions at my phone to protect my phone draining the battery. But, this app shouldnt have been affected. There shud be a pwd, email etc area into which i shud be able to introduce myself as registered user.! Also, upgrade and details links/buttons dont work on the app. I hope it is resolved."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's a much simpler version of the Microsoft Office version with very limited resources."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't open anything"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very instructive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. The number ons choice for Android for Word docs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Menu not comfortable Ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"You cannot delete or clean up files that are no longer useful.......I purchased the pro...don't waste your money."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Replaces Office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Simply the best Office app especially if you are used to classic desktop format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is just like my PC app. It took a little bit to find the features. Actually this is better. My PC app keeps crashing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I've only used the app a couple of times but it appears to work good! I'll spend more time on it when I can."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app has been a solid performer for me. It works across my devices, is compatible with Word, Excel, etc. My only slowdown is accessing the Autosave features when I accidentally exit the program. But the Autosave file is there when I finally find it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Everything you will ever need"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"East to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly similar to the PC interface. Good port. Suggestion: add an [enter|return] function to the mouse interface."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app indeed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's getting better. Still has some bugs and crashes every now and then but the devs are doing a good job. Overall, it's my favorite office app that's not google."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"App freezes. I have to close the app to continue editing the spreadsheet. Using a Samsung Galaxy SM-T970 with 7623 MB RAM. Running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 at 3.09 GHz. Shouldn't be freezing surely."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The developer has shown progress and the app is far less glitchy than it was originally. I have added a 4th star because of the developers efforts."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As easy to use as a desktop version This is a very well adapted piece of software that is as easy to use and navigate as the version on a desktop or laptop. I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a word processor when you don't have access to your computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Total commercial thank for nothing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"At best a C- This application has no spell check and that is a major issue. Do not try to use it with Chrome, you wll have problems. Except that the price is right (Free) I have found it to lack in almost every way possible. If the product improves I will inturn revise this review."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"There are no tool functions, or am I missing something... Trying to do a line of best fit on a graph ü§î"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app if you have been hacked"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It will not open for anything. It just displays the 3 colored circles."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good software for Chromebook"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The ui needs refreshing, and it's a bit slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app has all the functionality I need to perform my calculations. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Jeee"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is have a big problem while typing, it's not work ""right to left"" text option. And he is invisible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Software is very easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Zoom not avai on Android?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used the Windows version of this software (Apache Open Office) for years, and I was very happy to see it had been ported to Android. So far I have found the Text Document function to be almost exactly the same as the Windows version. Great job!!! I expect to find the other functions just as good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I've been using OpenOffice on my desktop for several years and love it. Recently, I've had a need to use it on my tablet and phone so I just installed it. However, it won't open any files - ALL IT DOES IS CRASH!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"A complete cluster, cant understand anything!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This office app is by far the most feature rich office in play store with more supported file types. I will give props for that. However the app is barely optimized for touch screen. The home screen is optimized but the PDF editor and calc looks like desktop version. The scales of the windows don't fit in screen. Horizontal scroll in calc is often unresponsive and not very smooth. The UI is very old. I can say more but my point is it needs more user friendly UI and more optimization."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using the Winddows version Open Office for several year. This android (Pro) version is a great addition."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best office package I have ever used on ANDROID, very well thought out! It's open source so that's really fantastic, but it hardly has any ads just 1 now and then, Big kudos to the Dev, full stars awarded. Thanks again!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Need to provide a modern look"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am thrilled to have this app on my Android Tablet. It Basicaly converts my tablet into a PC with Office functionality."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"GREAT program!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I think that it's the best office app for mobile."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The navigation across a spread sheet is very jerky. Makes it difficult to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Many promotions. Looking forward to change."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"better than libreoffice viewer, and you can edit too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn, stable , functions well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I describe the app as constructive, because it is a good alternative to MS Microsoft Words etc. Good job, and keep up the good works. Perhaps there are some hidden bugs, but I can live with that. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Brilliant program. Does everything I want. Well done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I'm using the paid version of this app. The responsiveness is very slow. When inserting a box and want to write in it, it takes several attempts to switch between writing in the box and modyfing it. Left and right arrows are not responsive. Text is not saved automatically. If it's not saved, it's lost. I would be happy to pay more if all these issues were addressed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's free and good enough."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good companion to Open Office windows. Selecting text using touch screen needs improvement. I would also like to have Tresorit and Proton drive support."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Samsung mobile j3"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Difficult to manipulate"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This keeps the cursor at place you last selected. WPS Office doesn't. In every way competes equally with WPS Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use sofar very stable"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very good. Works well on Chromebook. Developers helpful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Has a few glitches"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Compatible with OpenOffice is all u need?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Iol"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love OpenOffice Spreadsheets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This rubbish program often didn't open a document, now it doesn't open anything at all. How they can pretend this is like Apache/Libre office I don't know. Have un-installed it, just a waste of space."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Can't use shift to select a range of cells. Sometimes the 'handles' are not accessible to pull through a range of cells. However it is workable for simple tasks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is used full app for editing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I'm not very computer literate so am having problems with editing documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the one that works. I tried many others! It's sophisticated, and has full functionality. You can add headers and footers, add your own fonts. Full functionality where you need it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice to have on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very Nice App in Smart phone , learning to use it on tablet is important, as it got a different style than other similar apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I used to LOVE this app. Used it constantly to sub-edit the small magazine I work with. Now, although this is Open Source, ANDROID has started showing ADS and the only way you can get round this is to start paying for it. I refuse to let Google have access to my credit card details, so now I can no longer use this fantastic app. Since I've been asked to start paying, the app is crashing more often, too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"As soon as it finished installing my whole phone shut off and restarted. Once it turned back on it would not connect to the wifi. I had to uninstall the app and restarted my phone to fix it. Not sure why this happened."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well with Open Office on my Mac. Easy to create and edit files on both Mac and Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Keyboard doesn't appear when we try to type new document"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"EDIT I have restarted my phone and the licensed version is once again on my phone! Very pleased that the issue seems to have been fixed! I will amend my rating accordingly... Installed and paid for a license as it met my needs editing ODF documents, however I temporarily uninstalled as I needed to make space on my phone, when I reinstalled shortly after I was expected to pay for the license again. NOW FIXED!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is the very good app I can learn many things from it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect program"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Incredible office suite quite literally the real open office suite on a mobile device or TV box with a mouse and keyboard. Pro is steep at ¬£10.99 to remove ads it is a lifetime license but either way it's by far the number one office app in this sector by a hundred mile stretch it puts all else to shame."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ZIt is better understood then google sheets A better layout!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Opens .rtf files made with MS WordPad on a computer okay except for a loading error message that didn't stop functionality. Works offline and doesn't require logging in. I uninstalled only because this app has become a memory/storage hog. 400+ megabytes is way too much on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"5 star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best office app. Amazing functionality other things are also on point. Great job!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is harmfull for anyone, because this is screen reader from the developer, he can see everything what you typing or working while this hacking apk is open , It needs removed from apps store immediately"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app sure isn't Microsoft Word. Glitches such as when I'm typing it'll suddenly jump to another line of text and place my proseic thoughts there. (Did I spell proseic correctly?) In truth, I have no idea what ""collaboration features"" are. The thing that grips me is that half a century ago (+) NASA put men on the moon and returned all of them safely to Earth. (Disregard the space shuttle disasters as they were not moon missions.) JEEZ, I just ran out of characters. Well that figures."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Thank you l help in my study."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Doesn't open my excel."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unhappy. Tried to buy upgrade and got lost in the connect pages. Finally decided that the purchase was not worth the trouble. $12.99 saved but sale lost."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Having problems keeping pro. 9/27/2021 I have been using AndrOpen Office for about a year now. Now that every thing has been fixed and is responsive I love it. I choose to go Pro and it is the best choice for this app I have done. Love that I can save doc on the cloud. No adds. Extra fonts. If you used Apachie OpenOffice, it is the exact same thing, but without Base. In DeX it feels like you are at your PC! Great Job Keep up the great Wook Thank You!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Does what I need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very poor. No clear instructions, unable to save my progress to my computer without jumping through a lot of hoops and it's extremely disappointing. For the record I will NEVER purchase another ACER computer again, because I truly DESPISE this stuff where EVERYTHING is tied into Google."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"still too difficult to work with."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No mousepad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Have been using the app for last couple of days and my experience with it is so far satisfactory."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful and learning application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst excuse for an app I have ever seen. Can't even bet it to open a file."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A lot better than ""Hancock Office"". Traditional Excel like interface. Probably as good as it gets with limited cell phone screen space."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Annoying!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I like it and want recomanded it to everyone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is a really helpful app, especially if you are a student that is always on the go. The only criticism I have is I think the color of the out side liner is ugly. But that's not much of a criticism."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't know what to do or how to open a docx"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally I found this great app I had look for to experence my work just on android phone. Thanks may God Bless you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works just great! Like on a PC :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't really test it. Wouldn't allow me to save a doc to print so why would I pay a licence for an app I can't even test. Love open office. If this was a 7 day trial I would buy the licence. But as it stands I could buy it only to find out it doesn't work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app works very well and does everything I need it to do."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love using the PC version but this is awesome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"If you're used to OpenOffice/LibreOffice on a PC/laptop, then AndrOpenOffice moves editing to the tablet/smartphone (mobile keyboard and mouse/pen highly recommended). Absolutely does the job. No PC/laptop required anymore. Totally worth it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Pretty good üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Useful, but not really compatibile with ChromeOS. Hard to navigate, Zoom is bugged, no auto save... But it allow to open and modify OpenOffice files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"thanks for this useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This is good app only use for mobile"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üêâüí≤üí´ü¶àüêçüëçüéßüß∫"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works very well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst app for editing in mobile"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Overall good. I am using it in Android platform. Selection of texts is not friendly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excelent work!!!! Thanks a lot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This application is not designed to work on Android. It feels like it's the desktop version just haphazardly thrown onto Android. Worse this isn't free like the desktop app, with ads to remind you to pay up. Get Colabora Office if you are looking for Open Office on Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"app crashes and reverts to the ""select document type"" screen wiping out everything I wrote. well into a project and its all lost. brilliant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Complex paid for professional and now requires me to pay again for update thieves"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just wanted to open a file quickly and easily, it worked for what I wanted. That's all I can say üòÑ btw never saw an ad, but also never did any editing. Only just installed it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very useful office suite. I use it on the tablet much the same way I use Libre Office on the PC. Being able to sync to Dropbox means I can leave the laptop at home and still have access to all of my work as I travel. I have given 4 stars rather than 5 because there are a few quirks. Sometimes work in progress can be lost. Save frequently."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am content with this app. It functions and provides a full editing experience. I purchased pro to remove the ads (one time fee). All in all its a good app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"After having this app for several months and having also purchased the Pro, I'm overrall happy with it. It did start out as a buggy mess, but the developer's worked hard to smooth everything out and the app just keeps improving. Some features were a little late in coming, like the file sort, but I'm glad they prioritized stability first. I would definitely recommend this app as it is now, it's a great parallel app for OpenOffice with no issue using both whenever I move files between devices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works for me!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nearly great. I use it often, but I find myself going back to MS app when I want to do something a bit more jnvolved ie. Include picturesetc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This Adas is very disturbing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have discovered a serious bug in this app, or at least I think it's serious. When you choose file -> save as and then you choose (on purpose or by mistake) a file that already exists, it overwrites the file without warning you. And in a phone it's easy to make such a mistake..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Paid for app. Screen will not rotate and icons are too small. If screen could rotate the icons could be bigger and it would be usable. Works only with phone in verticle narrow position."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can't open documents I would like to read with this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I had purchased the ad free version of this app. Shockingly still ads come in batalion. I wonder what's the meaning of ad free life time...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good compatibility with OpenOffice. Highly recommendated. Support team response is fast, my issues of loading external fonts has been solved. I've purchased the Pro version, re-install the same apps and reboot, open the apps and click ""Upgrade"". Thank you Akikazu Yoshikawa san for your support."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like the computer but use hard"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice Very useful app"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice app! Helpful for editing word docs and turning it into pdf. Recommended!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You are providing a lot to us users at no cost, for that, we thank you!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works very well. But a lot of time when opening a download document of different sites it will not open them."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"In order to print something, I need to buy a membership. It used to be a ad, now I have to pay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"100 top"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Better than Excel"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OMG üò± real office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It took some time to figure out how the program works and saving documents. After a few false starts, not having documents saved, finally figured it out. I'm not a young user so it didn't come together easily."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I rated and used this app since 2019. It works everytime across phones and android pads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This AndrOpen Office is great. It is one of the few programs that I can still find spell check, the spreadsheet is very stable if you have something complicated to work on. To copy & paste = Copy= Ctrl C, then Paste= Ctrl V, once you have that solved, it is a great office program adapted for tablets . Mouse pad, keyboard & number pad icons are at the bottom, if you are not using a keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"At least they're honest. In the security statement, they developer admits that they collect your financial info. Enjoy!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Been trying to use this app ""successfully"" for months now. Not working. This is possibly the most ""glitch"" ladened app I've ever used. The only thing consistent about it, are the glitches. Formatting isn't reliable, autosave doesn't work regularly and the constant blacking out of the screen is riduculous. Will change rating when issues are remedied."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works really well, particularly on larger tablets. If there is a paid, and free version I would be really interested."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads are distracting and disruptive, please consider a statbar ad player if really needed. Cannot get AOO to open previous files to continue editing; I have to find the file in Xplore File Mgr via associated ""Open With"" option. YES, I have given file access. If I take the time to install an app, basic, relative permissions should be default. Recent file location should look in the folder where I save files, not in some obscure temporary file location."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works much better than MS Word, which came pre-installed on this device."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have rated this app 4 stars because it has all the functionality that I want but there aare a couple of niggles that II feel need to be fixed. 1. If I exit the app and forget to save my change, it doesn¬°t remind me and offer me an opportunity to save. 2. It doesn¬°s save recently used files. If these are fixed I will come back with 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Stupid app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling because the app stalls and crashes on ads...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Easy to understand"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just install and enjoy feel like working on pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"ofc apk,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works very well. I find the user interface not ideal for small screens but it is ok for my purposes. Warning to other users: If you have an ad-blocker (I have adaway), it hangs on ""start application"" when you try to create a new document or open an existing one. Also on attempting to install additonal fonts etc you get a strange warning about missing java libraries. The answer is to pause ad-blocking (or perhaps buy the pro version!). Good work Akikazu!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is just waste of the time, when we select the file from file manager and after we r going to open with this garbage app, and file is opened with all the text's are disappear. This app is all about nothing. You guy's have to do exercise in practical before launched this shi*"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Although, the a lot of functions but keyboard does appear my device any time I want type. If can do something about it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Controls are unclear and not user friendly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like it because it is a good app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Most satisfactory. Works exactly as the windows version. Very happy. Recommended app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Did work great as a paid app now not working for any excel downloads sucks that i paid for something that stops working."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I liked it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a free open office for mobile I am very happy to see it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Just stupid"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It doesn't run"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice office app.. Able to read hindi font."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crashes frequently. Screen is extremely cluttered."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Aila"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have used most of the applications within this program. The all work well with no problems."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is a decent free app in many ways. But 2 issues make it deserve at most a 3-star score. First issue - it can't automatically go back to the previous open/edit position. 2nd but the most lethal issue - it can‚Äôt save the document properly once a while, and would somehow delete all data in that file. That is totally unacceptable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is not possible to use the downloaded fonts (from add - ons )."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is a good app. I apricate it !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"School padanatine poliyane"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"After downloading, it refuses to install"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst word writer I have ever used.it hangs , lags , and many functions are not being performed!!!!! !! . I don't recommend this to anyone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I had difficulty when trying to upgrade to the paid version so that I could use with Google drive. None of the upgrade buttons worked. Following removal of the app, reboot, reinstall the app, reboot it upgraded and now is a whole lot more useful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app & download Collabora Office instead. They still believe in what open source project really means by keeping the their app totally free of advertising and payments. I WILL NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS! You've taken a TOTALLY FREE open source project and DESTROYED the whole concept of open source by CHARGING FOR IT! YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exciting at the program. It does more than expected. One of the Best Office Apps Around. Very Easy to Work & Run Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really most important app complete world each and every one must have."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is a amazing app great . 100 per cent recommend"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not easy to use. I paid the money but can't edit. Everything keeps opening in read only."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I know open office so I'm already satisfied and all I've done is successfully open a PDF and click on some text and delete a few letters. It worked which is amazing considering the song and dance that everyone else is up to. Subscribe to this and we will give you this POS lol hysterical I'm sure adobe is polished and functional yeah let's hope so!!! Everyone else has some interesting reviews hehe thanks to all the individuals that put the hard work in!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The android version is improving regularly. It allows me to work across devices. I can switch between word processors on different devices. It is invaluable. I couldn't operate without it. I have the PRO version. When I get a new device and install, the PRO comes with it. It works offline. I combine it with Dropbox and Google Drive to share documents. There are continual improvements. June 2022 - after 3 years, still cheering!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The one area that Andre Open Office was deficient, in my view, was in the use of voice dictation. It annoyingly retained lower case at the start of each new sentence. Although not included in the list of improvements I notice that the new version managed to correct this shortcoming. This now makes it my open office app of choice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"the fontworks aren't visible ...but it's goodüôÇü•±"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well sharing with desktop Libreoffice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I downloaded the the free version to test it before making any purchase. It has a nice feel, like having the desktop version. It does have bugs, like freezing after the phone (Samsung Galaxy A03s lates version of Android 11) comes out of lock and when the app is minimized and brought back it will freezes and take about 30 seconds to come to full function. But still has a lag. If this is fixed I would give it a 5 star, and buy the full version, for now a 3 star will have to suffice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER: It happens on two devices, running different versions of Android OS, seems like a flaw in the recent update needs to be addressed and corrected. REVIEW: Right now, the app is crashing instead of opening supported file formats that are not its open document formats"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its very inportant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. One thing I miss is being offered the choice of going back to where I was in a long document when I reopen it. On the whole it's very usable and works well. Just found though that the arrow keys to move the cursor don't work. This slows editing corrections. Shame."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible interface. Intrusive adds that don't exit when pressing back button."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Sometimes it's difficult to navigate in the spread sheet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Too complicated, too big, feels like running a VM on your phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"feel very uncomertable and outdated"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"it was VERY ANOYING, beacuse it couldn't scroll properly and had VERY outdated software. also it was very teideious to save anything."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"app has been freezing up, if save was not pushed prior to to the freeze, all the data entered gets lost..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Only issue I have is that you can exit the app without being challanged to save/ignore your document (no auto save)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Repair na Hindi nag download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office app for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was looking for an office app very long thats why 5 stars plus 1"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't support for telugu letters. Some words are not typed if i type the word. please try to type as ‡∞∞‡∞Æ‡±ç‡∞Ø, ‡∞ï‡∞≤‡±Ü‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ü‡∞∞‡±ç,‡∞™‡∞ï‡±ç‡∞ï‡∞® etc....please solve this problem. Worst app. Don't buy it i don't want to give one star also."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Free and functional, good for smal companie administration"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I downloaded it to print a file and it asked to upgrade to do that. The developer made a joke on Open Source."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very slow. Other apps are comparatively smaller in size and faster too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It can create pdf file from MS office file. It is nice. In addition it's free. If it read pdf file it would be better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Honestly, I do like this app. BUT I wish simple things like cutting and pasting were more intuitive like MS Word or the real Open Office. I have the pro version and it is just so NOT intuitive. Keyboard disappeared."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used Open Office on PC for years and am an happy I can now use it on my android devices as well!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use it on my Android phone. The app is easy to use, but the Android keyboard is too big for this screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"collabora office and only office worked better in a20 with very less lag"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mobile mode of open office ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This piece of absolute garbage simply does not work. The text editor won't let you type without bringing up formatting options, the drawing app just simply igjores you. ¬£11 down the toilet... Thanks, dirtbags. Your software sucks, not that you care. Would rate a zero if I could."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Handles most used features found in MS Office suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a brilliant office app and I have no hesitation in recommending it as a direct replacement for MS Office. If I could change one thing it would be to make the PDF features a little more user friendly. Other than that... fill your boots it is excellent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice copy of open office writer to android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I've had the app and with premium. I can no longer update it or re-download it (it keeps telling me to free space up, even though I have 30GB+ free). I'm not sure if this is a problem with AndrOpen Office or a Chrome OS blunder, there's been several of the latter after the last few updates."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Informative & knowledge"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Reviewing ""Professional."" LG v20, H910, Nougat 7.0, Logitech K810 Bluetooth Keyboard, Microsoft 3600 Mobile Mouse, Fixed Landscape Mount. In order to use this app most effectively as a Microsoft Office replacement, I have included the extra devices at the beginning of this review and recommend them. BT keyboards allow necessary fullscreen view. A mount will save your neck. The mouse gives precise text entry and right click restores menu functionality."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Still need to explore more, but the number one feature I use in spreadsheets doesn't work, and that is the advanced click and drag stuff, such as selecting a cell and dragging to copy the formula to other cells, or to continue a pattern. Thos hasn't been done well in other mobile apps because you need to be too precise for using a finger, but to remove it?. You guys should try the right 1/4 of cell to drag and copy, the left 1/4 for drag to move, and the center half for drag to select."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office app for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I Prefer this to windows word."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its a beautiful experience"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Used it offen very helpful struggle bid in beginning till I learn app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"So far so good. But a bit of a challenge to open"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is by FAR the best office app for Android as long as I know. All the others I've bought and tested might have a better GUI but none is even close to real working functions. Since I'm working with Open Office documents (ODF and similar) on my laptop this is the only app that supports these documents and all the features and functions of the desktop open office packages. I give my hat to you Akikakzu for making the only office package app worth the name."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use it on all platforms"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I suffer from bugs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Superb! Masterfully crafted and extraordinarily underated. I dare to now say this is superior to any mobile ms or other open source office solutions in every way. I offer my sincerest, ""bravo""! Please consider including a patreon account or other information so we can help fund your endeavors for these projects."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The apps are intuitive and very easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works. No issues."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Delightful APP, love the free version for us on a fixed income."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Supports Microsoft Excel Forms! I have been looking for apps that supports it. I love you guys!!! You guys made my life a lot easier. Thanks mate."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Delivers exactly what it promisesüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"After installing when tap on any doc or items its show a screen start application thats it.!!!! Tried reinstalling cashe clearing results same.. Thanks for wasting time.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Outstanding. Feels like I am operating my computer open office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Been looking for a word processor for my tablet, this one is awesome. Bought it the first day and have no regrets. Cheap, fully functional and does several formats, couldn't ak for more. Keep up the good work guys."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great App ‚Ä¢ Lightweight ‚Ä¢ Efficient"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"491mb is too big. looking good but for who can afford it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Simple and reliable. The purchased version is worthy because the app itself is great as well as the support, and no ads really help to stay focused."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love OpenOffice on my laptop and, other than the obvious keyboard size issues, AndrOpen Office seems to be a great take along alternative! I had some issues at first and their Techs resolved it quickly and easily."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It was cool using this application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not installed on phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very similar to Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Did what I needed it to do"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's difficult to rate an app that gives you no access to your files without paying for the commercial version. I would think that a trial version that let's you do everything for a limited time or number of launches would be better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have installed this on my Samsung Tablet and Samsung Android phone, and it allows me to mobile with these ""office"" features."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I did some writing and when I pressed save then I got an ERROR message and nothing was saved. I see now that I'm going to have to either get a PC or buy Word for android but my hopes of using libreoffice on Android without bugs, errors or sloppy UI is dashed. It's just another broken cheap software that shows promise and nothing ells. Its still in Beta form but better than nothing which is not saying a lot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very good! Love it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Most useful app I use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very good port in general. I can use it nicely with physical keyboard etc. perfect for a tablet. However, most of the interfaces are not ported over to Android so it's probably best if you use this with a physical mouse. Otherwise, I often find it hard to tap with fingers on the touchscreen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My Location is phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very bad documentati on can't download easily"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This is very helpful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Well but the app needs to malfunction properly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Hi, I have sent and email on 4th March'21 with respect to an issue in the paid version. Would appreciate a reply on that. Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use open office on my pc, so it is easy use to AndrOpen Office on my tablet with a familiar interface. Great app, recommended"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I left a 5 star review years ago after having it for 20 years without any problems. Now I'm afraid I have to give this package 1 star. Open Office for both Android and Desktop keeps crashing. So much so that I have purchased Office and not having any problems with it. I used to love Open Office but now you can't do anything with it as you just don't know when it'll crash. There are too many adverts with the software as well. You're always being asked if you want to upgrade to the paid version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"v.nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Purchased the paid version to be able to change the fonts in document. Doesn't work on my Galaxy Note 20 Ultra."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is still amazing, but after the last update, I have seemed to of lost the ability to move the toolbars around while in Samsung DeX desktop mode. Because I am using the app on the big screen. It's not a big deal, but I am slightly disapointed at losing that function. I did email earlier about the zoom scroll bar at the bottom, but I was able to fix that. I only wish the app would automatically switch between mobile and desktop modes when I start Samsung DeX like it used to."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Strange behavior. Every time I open an excel workbook it opens in read only. Some workbooks don't open and app halts at 80% of progress bar. Same workbook saved in LibreOffice opens fine. I'll check back later to see if bugs are worked out. I was hoping this would be a reasonable replacement for Office 365."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Extremely helpful office. I Really feel flying bird.(logo of OpenOffice) Wonder why ""base"" can't work?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and effective"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A pretty decent Android Office app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice massively..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"its good but sometimes it experience crashing and half of the screen displa pitch black. Hope developer take notice of this issue and fix it for future use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far so good, if it continues to perform I will purchase."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I need to upgrade to be able to use it with data in the cloud. My purchase is being declined (I asume from Google). My card is normal debit card, which I use for many transaction. As everything is machined managed and there is nobody to talk to, I just had to deleted the app. No doubt, it is a good program"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app !!! Thank so much !!! Working perfectly and have not ads thankfully !!!üëèüëèüëèüëçüëåüòöüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüdefinitely !!!

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can not upgrade to pro version, ""upgrade"" button does nothing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"having made the transition from Windows to Chrome OS with a Chromebook - I have tried various alternatives to MS Office and found AndrOpen Office an excellent alternative. I have worked almost exclusively in MS products, and found that apart from minor formatting issues, I can use existing .doc and .docx documents, save them to both hard drive/ or cloud and they remain as I want them. I have paid the small amount to get the full package - it is a lot less than MS Office 365 and NO ADS!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Is there a way to move andro office to gws to learn the speadsheet macros"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"If it would save my files correctly and consistently I might consider the paid version. I am a frequent saver, so it is extremely disappointing when the app crashes somewhat regularly (not unexpected migrating a Java desktop project to a tablet) and then finding that my last several saves have not executed and I have to redo a significant body of work."

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I paid for the upgrade yet it didn't take or something even tho the upgrade is listed in my playstore transactions so I'm still getting ads and it's constantly asking me to upgrade. The app is great, 5 stars but I give it only 3 stars overall because I wasted 13 dollars doing an upgrade for nothing. Ugh!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to figure out"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good Android alternative for MS products. Especially good for Android tablets. For phone (small screen) use maybe not so good. Adds are bit annoying. It would be nice if those fonts on row and column headers would scale like the cell font when zooming in/out. Or is there option for that? Yes there is.. thanks..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Too many ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love the versatility and got to love the price!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I dont want to give star because when i was making my presentation it closed it and show error and waste my whole work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works fine, better than competing apps at least. Editing files works, but file management is very frustrating. I opened a file from Whatsapp, but couldn't save it on my SD-card. Tried saving it directly on the SD-card. It told me to create a sub-folder. Tried saving it in the folder, it told me to save it on the SD-card. When a file is already on the SD-card just saving it works, but ""Save as..."" doesn't, that works only for the internal storage."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Excellent piece of work my man though am having some challenges the app just zooms the tables to infinite and giving no option to restore it, secondly the app keeps on replacing information on previous saved documents resulting in total loss of information I would appreciate if anything can be done about it or even advice of some kind can help otherwise great app changing my phone into computer."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great job on fixing the glitches, I'm using the current version. The last time I used it--it was good. This this it's great. But be watchful on comments and faithful to the commentary. Maybe a portal (internally) for error reporting rather than relying strictly on the play store. This can generate negative reviews producing change and positive reviews producing physical topology word of mouth, such as account groups or network, or better yet one on one physical conversions. Beats office.üòá"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"On typical smartphone of size 6.65 inch or below the interface would look cluttered and would be difficult to work on. I am a long time user of Libreoffice, infact its my daily driver for office works. Have installed basically to use on Galaxy Tab S7 FE and the App is quite usable on tablet. The App is not fully optimized for Android yet, but for user of Libreoffice or openoffice there isn't much chose out there. Hope dev bring improvement. Bought premium version as a thank you to open source."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use AndrOpen daily. It was a bit overwhelming initially. Installing Apache OpenOffice on my desktop helped get the lay of the land. I have the Professional Pack, a good investment. I mainly use the Writer. I appreciate opening and saving docs without conversion or negotiating where it is stored. One click on the save button and I'm done. I write on both my desktop and phones and use a Google Drive folder to stay organized between devices. I had tried most other office suites now deleted from my devices. Some functions initially challenging such as copy and paste and formatting, but now I have no problem. I am very grateful this app exists my search has ended."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app refused to be installed in my phone üòî, why?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's looking great so far. I need a reliable, offline, document editor for work. The only niggle I have is the scrolling - it isn't very intuitive. I'll be trying this for a few days before deciding on whether to buy the licence, but it is looking good so far. Oh, and I love the fact you can save your own templates - such a time-saver!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I am giving 3 stars because, first of all selection is not working in Android mode and in dekstop there is no way to open the keyboard, very much bad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks for your suggestion of the Hacker's keyboard Can create and edit spreadsheets again. It works well including using function keys If it would hold the shift key down while shading in then I wouldn't need any other keyb. However still need to use the number pad in Android open office for shading in cells with shift.No probs:) 1st review: Early version had an escape button. Now the phone back arrow undoes too much. Without it cannot create sheets easily. Would like the F keys of desktop too."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works good; but sometimes it is difficult to save as .docx after z document is edited. And files saved as .odt is impossible to open with Microsoft Office. So, it is best if either z software is developed as compatible with Office operating or if z software is upgraded as computer software."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"When i open pdf to edit.....they r changing the font style and shape......its not good app.....we cannot edit it with the same font wat we want"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The app itself is a good port, but causes really irritating problem. It would appear that since it not handle a specific file type, some file managers automatically assume it handles any file that is of unknown type and opens up this app since it's top of app list. I hope this be can rectified, since it is quite annoying having it effectively disabling features in other apps."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. Not great. Wants to change what I have corrected. I don't use word helpers powered by ai. I know what I want to say, how I want to say it and no prompt knows this. Past has no bearing on present occurrence. I use grammar and its variants to convey what I mean to present. Unless I occasionally use a spelling checker, I don't want to be edited, unless I ask to be edited. I can make a mistake. My typewriter program shouldn't make one for me."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very similar to the desktop app. Have been using it a few weeks and just the sheer amount of different apps (ALL of OpenOffice, including the spreadsheet and DRAW), makes it worthwhile to download, regardless of what other apps you already have. There are bugs though, hence the 3 stars, as well as the price for the Pro version is a bit steep, considdering that the PC/Desktop version is completely free and FOSS. If the price was less and the bugs sorted, it would be worth 5 stars"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My school use this app for computer session in online classes but I can't open the slide transition & custom animation icons."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best word processor I've found for a Chromebook. The adds are not intrusive - just one when you close. It looks and feels like Word '97 which is all most of us ever need. To reopen a file it's file/open/my files or downloads. To save as a wordxp doc rather than an openoffice doc, it's save as/browse/the dropdown triangle. The developer responded well when I had a problem."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As good as MS Office and does not cost one cent. Send these folks a few dollars, as they sure as hell deserve it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"5-star app. But 4-star rating due to the fact that I had to re-install the pro pack addon after the update to get the ads to stop showing up. Adding a prompt to re-install the addon that I've previously purchased is better than when I click the link in the app and it requests another purchase. Going through my play store link to open the addon allows me to re-install without payment. Have you changed the way the app recieves the pro upgrade?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"USELESS after update unless $ paid. Don't download. Was always crashing anyway."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice one"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use this from time to time, writings a passion of mine so this is pretty good for writing down mini stories and ideas."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app. Keep it in your tool belt if it doesn't work it's because your uneducated Its not a rip off . For hecks sake it's for free . Learn"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't waste time"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very applicable, thank you."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Paid the $7.99 for access to cloud storage and it can't even save to it. Unless you have nthe file on your device, don't even bother."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Annoying, hides docs and ridiculous interface for phones. Trying to bypass as much as possible it but they make it hard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Soo good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Put more features"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Have to accept the moderate amount of ads, not used to that coming from PC. Whenever a PC is in reach, I use the spreadsheet on the PC, 'cause the finger is not sharp enough. Perhaps there is another mode, more adequate for the use on a microscopic touch screen. But astonishingly well done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is not downloading"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not expert file"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Not enought room on a s10+ to do any useful work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Everything I can do on Microsoft Office I can do with AndrOpen Office. A few things need some getting used to but I think it's all there. My congratulations to the programmers! Fantastic work! I have worked with Open Office and this is the same. I can transfer documents from my Linux system to my Windows system to my Android tablet via my home network without a problem. It connects with my network printer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been searching for a great office app for android ever since I got into Android. We finally have it. This is a 100% full-featured version of OpenOffice with everything you would want or need, premium is an only one-time payment with full cloud support with drive. No BS. Finally, I will never need docs for backup ever again. Only two things that bother me are that I'd like a dark mode and scrolling that doesn't feel sluggish at times."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't let you close without ads. Ads might be acceptable at the beginning, but when you have a reason to close an app it needs to close. Immediately. Not take over the screen in a bright and conspicuous manner, with a countdown to be able to get rid of it. Apparently somehow I made the mistake of having the phone use this app to open certain files or something. Thank you for prompting me to leave a review. I hope you like it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"My father is always busy in his office work and he wasn't able to give me his laptop so I asked one of my friends and he told me about this app.And really it's a great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Clever tools...l"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use and opened my .ods OppenOffice file with no issues. Was also able to resave it as an xls."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Have been always wondering if there was an app for open office as this is what I use on a daily basis. Transferred my personal work templates from my computer to my phone and perfect! I can now send quotes and invoices anywhere I like and away from the computer. Really good app, works smoothly with minimal ads and relatively easy to navigate around the app. Super happy to have found this, making life a lot easier and my response times quicker!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app. 100% recommend. When writing you don't get any ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good app but hard to find signature tool if it even exists also no help button or find field"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"not working without playstore."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"works fine but PLEASE make it not associate every single file extension with itself it's really darn annoying"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fairly consistent look as Linux/Windows OpenOffice. Love using it for offline files. Works best if you have an external mouse and keyboard but works great with desktop mode turned off too! Can be personalised and able to import fonts, which is great. Lots of customization, worth the time to explore the settings. My preferred app for editing docs on Android. Thanks, dev team!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great paired with the free PC download (Apache Open Office). Powerful applications with a friendly well placed interface. Personal cloud storage access; Well worth, all the precise and professional efforts involved. Thanks...."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can anyone tell me how to used it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Slow, and by the time you have something to edit on screen, only about half the screen is usable. Filling the screen with menu bars et al makes it even less usable. Use this *only* if 1) you *must* edit OpenDocument (ODT) files and 2) you can't use Collabora Office for some reason."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very important aap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"i dont even know what to do on this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I have no issues. And you need a stand alone office system. I'm tired of google. Even office everything is thru their cloud."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for a while. This is by far my number 1 office application. I stopped using the rest and uninstalled them. Get the ProPack and support!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As a writer I use this app to produce segments of pages that I can edit later using other means. This product is great for that transportability and organizing in a small tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Any app that doesn't inform the user that you can't save documents to any app unless you upgrade to premium and which prevents you from opening a document unless you use an app that is only unlocked if you upgrade to premium is not only useless but it's blatantly fraudulent. Users using free versions of apps shouldn't be stuck with an app that effectively denies you the ability to do anything on it. (I am referring to the Android version only.)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It don't has more features as real OpenOffice writer, Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Opens.dot documents in read only so you then have to open another copy to edit, or simply copy to the clipboard. Then you have to close both copied."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The latest version has made the hard copy option part of the premium package. Given that making a printed copy is a rather basic function it seems unreasonable to make it part of the paid for version. I recall it once being free."

I can create, edit, save, export and print documents directly on my device just like I could with Pages on iOS and my old iPhone. Google Docs doesn't allow this without an internet connection, and with my free Google Drive storage filled I couldn't make new documents on Google Docs even though I was only interested in offline work.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Despite being very easy to use, it's still barely usable, as it stops working every 30 seconds. Can't do any work. Probably works for reading documents. Just don't make any edits. Obviously needs more bug testing. Note, I only got around to Spreadsheets before giving up on it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Please note that this program is not fully functional. Though it has functions in the menu for printer setup and envelope printing. ""They are not supported"" as per AndrOpen support, but there is nothing in the program that indicates this other than they do not work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Too slow to load-but does the job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Why doesn't it ask me what language I use to spell check, and automatically load that for me?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So pleased to have found this app. I previously used Apache Open Office on my Windows laptop,and having switched to a Chromebook needed to have a facility to type letters. AndrOpen Office is highly recommended as easy to use and with a good range of scripts."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No good. Poor app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice application for make presentation"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Copy write"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is boring app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Read documents, log info on spreadsheets, compose letters/memos."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've tried many different apps, and this is is without a doubt the best I've found. All the others are either too buggy or not user friendly."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Help in the pc work of open office impress good and amazing app but there is one problem in this app is that it contains professional version pack but it is paid version that not make so much good but it gives me a very good experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sure, it has a few quirks and is a bit unresponsive at times, but it's perfect for my current needs, so after a few weeks of evaluating the trial version I paid for the AD free version. Hopefully enough people will do the same and it'll get developed and optimized even further."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Good app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"not imstol app üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for a few years and find it pretty good. Downloaded it in order to be able to print address labels which I couldn't using Google equivalents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very awful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Worked okay, but I need to uninstall it to save space. How do you uninstall?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app doesn't seem like it's kept up to date with the latest Open Document standards. Every time I try to open up documents created with LibreOffice, it complains that the document is a newer version than the app supports, and that I need to update the app (which doesn't help). Maybe this app works fine if you only edit docs you've created with it, but that's not my use case, and I doubt it would be most people's use cases."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"WTH. A word processor that you can't print from? What good is it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Works good at first but now when I change it and save it closes and doesn't save the info"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Has a good UI and if you just want a word processor and spread sheet it‚Äôs good. But if you want something to read and edit the latest MS Office files you‚Äôre out of luck. It‚Äôs only fully compatible with 10 yr old MS programs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Missing functionality in the Base component. Cannot create a Primary Key field in a new database using Onteger field type. A Primary Key is essential in creating a reliable database."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"thanx for this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the best app out there beats any Msoft office product!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Nice emulation of OpenOffice, but it is very old implementation, so not really compatible with LibreOffice 6+ documents. Also full of full screen ads..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I would say it's simple and helpful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great editing app.It's like having a Microsoft word in your mobile phone,contains almost everything.Keep up with the good work üëç üëç."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Stupid app never ever"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works much like the desktop version. Takes time to learn the Mobile adaptation. The undo function works well. Bought the full version. Would like to see importation of ttf, and an easier way to cut and paste. Export to pdf works perfectly, so the. odt can be pdf to anyone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpen Office is a solid program. It has lots of functions and does just about everything that the ridiculously priced Microsoft Office does. It does take some getting use to and time to learn functions. Some functions take several steps more than Google and Microsoft. But for the price, I'm not complaining!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Free on PC with no ads at all, yet works well and has never given me reason to complain. This port is a blatant cash-grab using the name of good pc software to trick people into downloading. This software is laggy and does not compae in any way to the pc version. That it then asks for money is laughable."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Can you please tell me how to save a template??"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Almost like the computer application. Only that if it supports .docx files I would give it 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Opening .docx had blank pages. Ads like crazy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a good app ILIKE THIS"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Vrygood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Bought the app in January, Now it doesn't recognise my purchase and wants me to pay again to upgrade. Couldn't find support so have put problem on here in the hope I get a resolution. Have enjoyed using the app so far but this is a problem. Update, uninstalled & downloaded app again and now have the pro version. All OK"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The app is not working"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"On my Samsung Galaxy no zoom of documents. Useless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Dont like it. Can delete files. Cant move files from it to a any other place you want. Its restricted."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've been very impressed with how this app is able to do virtually all of the things I rely on the regular desktop version to do."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.. is exactly like the one used on a computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just what i needed. üòâ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads are VERY intrusive for a office application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good. However my color pellete that i added was removed when I updated. Thank you. Dakota"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I'm not going to waste my time critiquing this app in detail. What I will say is be warned: this program will cause you to lose work if and when you move away from it temporarily to open and use another app. When you return to this app you will find that it has closed your opened document without saving."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good apps, really helpfull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"brilliant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is a computer learning app and very good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect on Samsung Dex. All is needed is to properly scale the UI. PROBLEM: cannot seem to load custom fonts even if these are in the default directory. Is it a known bug?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It is not as good as Open Office. It tries to do too much on a phone's tiny screen. It nags too much as well. I am about to give up on it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"App is quite good but generated file is not opened anymore"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"About as good as it can be on a tablet. The developers have done a good job given the limitations. Still awkward to use the spreadsheet but really useful to have a spreadsheet on the tablet for occasional use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just like the desktop version! Completely usable free version, but I support this, so I paid for pro. Works best with bluetooth keyboard and mouse on a tablet. Can scale the UI as needed if lacking keyboard/mouse, or if using a phone. Right-click even works in it. Just marvelous."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but when I tried using it again recently, it crashes when I open any document. Even when I uninstalled and reinstalled again. That's too bad because it's the absolute only program that I was able to edit one of my brother's old documents with."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to download, and it works. Without the need to pay for an updated version when a Cpropration decides to put out a newer version. Great functionality, for Chrome, Apple or DOS Computers ideal for sharing documents across platforms."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best android app ever"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've been able to open everything sent to me. It helps me to not go running to a PC just to read and respond to docs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great Alternative for all my documents"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT! STILL LEARNING HOW TO OPERATE LIKE I DID WITH MICROSOFT OFFICE BUT STILL LOVING IT."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best ap for computer studies"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app for Android. Full functionality of PC. No other app can compete this app in android. Now we can use custom fonts in android which was impossible in other android apps ... Thanks üëç developers.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An excellent implementation of OpenOffice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"100 ot of 100"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It does what it is supposed to do."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"WORTH PERSEVERING -LOTS TO LEARN. The more i use it the more i like what the dev is doing here. Some (including myself at first) dont get along with it is because there is so much, persevere, its all there, lots of it! Ads-on leaving a document/the app-so not intrusive when working. To print export as pdf then open in a pdf reader - or pay one off ¬£7.99 for full unlock (95%+ is already free 100% can be worked around). Had for ages about to pay - because i choose to, not have to, says it all. A++"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a full featured word processor and while it takes a bit of getting used to new command menu placement it is versatile and a great addition. I use it in writing screenplays and short stories and keep a story bible with each project also."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Because do when work if I want to do presentation this app will become back to home screen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It just sucks big time. I can hardly get anything done, so I uninstalled it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I uninstalled it because of the unnecessary permissions. One of many is the apps need to see ALL of the phones wifi connections. Why? Better question why does google even give apps that option?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It is good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app is not so good and that's why I'm giving 2 stars only."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You can paste content... It is a nice office suite and I hope it will remain free as it is. Make a good help section included in the app. Quite good. There are a few ads but they are not too intrusive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"the default settings are constricted, and allow only tiny windows to navigate, the app works for reading, and limited editing of imported odt docs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What ever I do I always have to buy an ""upgrade"" oh & now you have to buy another ""upgrade""..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"UI could use some streamline but otherwise good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app for Android or iOS version"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is best for Doing the pratical or anyother work also."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good app but as many features as you need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can not edit spreadsheets. Really?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app for how easy it is to use. I thought I would struggle without the keyboard and I had a short learning curve, then just love it!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tatti tatti tatti"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is trash. It deleted my entire file when I tried to save it. The app saved an empty file and then erased everything on the page. Hours of work wasted!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"How app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Quite useful version of the PC program. I'm not quite so big a fan of the big office competitor. Have even given some $."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can i write with same font which is used in that pdf?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its really confusing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I can not give it 5 star as it doesn't contains database"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't use it it's a load of rubbish"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So nice to view and edit any spreedsheet on your phone!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Absolutely everything I need it for, word processing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Erratic UI . Ex.: tried to change font size on current text . I was able to highlight the text but could not change font size even though I selected the size change from the size menu . There are too many of these type of issues ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very helpful to me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best ever app for pdf editor"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Interface's is nicely with my open office app on my pc. For a non techie, it's not exactly intuitive, as with OpenOffice. But I make it work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"FIFA is the very interesting game"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I`ll be generous to oblige 4stars. Due to the fact that, I am able to do my work with my tab gtp1500/2013. The touch pad was available when I first installed, now it isn`t working. But, still it has more functions than what I had expected from this app. Need time to explore. Good job."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's perfect but it takes time to learn all the functions. In android, this is the best office in terms of features & productivity."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app...works with a page turn and multifunction bluetooth foot pedal. Takes a while tog load a doc but that may be my discount device. Very reliable. Plays well with libre generated writer docs and maintains correct format. So good so far after 3 months"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works so well. Awesome app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Previously I awarded 3 stars and wrote: ""Impossible to select a single word, or to paste into the middle of a line. Pressing words elsewhere on Android phones (for example, in the Google search field) just selects the word. In AndrOpenOffice it causes a context menu to display."" Just found out you *double-tap* to select a word and slide the handles to alter the selection! Now AOO is perfect!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unable to upgrade tried two times using gay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great for work documentation, on the go, or as a desktop setup."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Difficult to read in a page."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ok Some what good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Most of the fonts are identical How do you save something? With other versions of Open Office, it's easy. This version? Not so much. I still ain't figured it out. The Free Version of this Open Office can't access any cloud storage you might have, nor the documents folder on/in your computer/tablet/phone. The other free with no ads or in-app purchaes versions of OO can access your cloud storage, and the documents folder on your device. In short, pretty much useless unless you spend $7 and coin."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It was used to be a good app. Buy simply now it does not start"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"App is OK. It processes ODS files natively. I only use one crucial spreadsheet file that I update & backup regularly. The app crashes occasionally & is peculiar to use. Thus, complex revisions are done on the laptop. I've used ODS files for several years & previously had to convert to XLS for phone use with a different app. I recall Open Office for Android was not free, but it is now. I find AndrOpen Office to be unstable & unreliable for critical documents. Avoid risk by using a laptop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"How do I install asian traditional chinese?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Sorta works. Running a registered version on a Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 with Android 10. Quirks make it less than optimal. I've been able to work around most issues but I've lost a couple of spreadsheet files. Uses the standard desktop interface which is less than optimal for a tablet/touchscreen. With the Samsung Galaxy Tab I can connect to a full size display, bluetooth keyboard, and mouse. Using it without these accessories would be difficult at best. Sadly, not ready for prime time!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As an ex-Microsoftie I looked for a decent office replacement I could use on my tablet and laptop. I do 95% of my work on my tablet now. I did NOT want to get a sub to office 365. I looked at multiple office replacements and this one is by far the best and most comprehensive. I needed scripts/macros in apps like excel but this is the only 1 I found that has them. There are a few UI issues but they are tablet versus laptop differences. The effort is massive and they have done well. I donated."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"A good alternative to Word. However, I need to switch between my word processor and web browser so that I can paste in screenshots to create a jobsearching record that I can show to other people, as and when needed. If there is a way to do it in AndrOpen Office, I cannnot find it. (No visible taskbar to select the different apps)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Please help me when ever I try to download additional files it says network error but I have an Internet connection. .....am so stressed fix this problem"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The free version is not very reliable so far and I've only tested Excel. I want to edit a document on my tablet while I'm mobile. The doc isn't very complex; two sheets with about 20 hyperlinks on the first sheet taking me to various points on the second sheet. It lags so bad when clicking/scrolling with hyperlinks in view. Yesterday the hyperlinks worked fine, today clicking on a hyperlink gives me a finger pointer icon and opens the menu as though I'd held my finger down. Very odd. I wouldn't pay for the premium version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"do NOT install this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolute waste of time. DO NOT USE. Spent 2hrs on a document for it to only completely dissapear when saving. Absolute joy. save yourself the bother and go somewhere else because this app is absolute trash. I wasn't much of a fan before it decided to completely ruin my night as it felt like using a wordpad programme from the early 90s."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app mouse in Vary dead it is not work in click center"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Get rid of ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is really a better aap for android. I do all my office wort on it last 2 years. I am very appreciate....."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've used Open Office for years, and turned to it again when I needed an application to use with my new Samsung Tablet Keyboard. It remains as versatile and transparent as ever to any user who is accostomed to the use of word processors of any sort."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"THIS APP SUCKS SO BAD , Windows and Android they have different names for a reason !!!! What you created is a NIGHTMARE what were you thinking in 2013 when.you made it? much less now 2021? Bill gates would send a hit man to you after he called off sick from work after throwing his guts up viewing your app ... I never felt to tell someone this but in this case I felt the need to tell you , its like when someone is not a good singer but people listen? Until one day they find out how bad they are"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love having Open Office ported, my favorite suite of tools"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice and useful app. I like it very much. Thanks thanks thanks to the developers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"OK word processor but some read only settings incomprehensible"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very feature packed app! Nicely done!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"April 2021 after latest update: No matter whether attempting new document or opening old, presented with BLANK BLACK SCREEN under title bar. HELP"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Memudahkan"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just installed haven't used very much but just the fact that one of the best open source office suites is finally on Android makes this worth the price for lincensed version. I use LibreOffice all the time. To the developer thank you!!! Will update as get more into using it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I needed to create a spreadsheet in a hurry and so installed this on my tablet. After 20 minutes of using it, I purchased it. It has done everything that I have needed from it, but at this point in time I have only used the spreadsheet and word processor. That's the only reason I have only given it a four star rating. If the remaining elements are as good, I'll happily increase to five."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is useful guys, but...i think we need to use up to years to learn how to use this app..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Powerful, can be used on a tablet's touchscreen (with a degree of effort) but I strongly suspect it works best with a mouse and keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Why am I not able to access databaseüò£üòü"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a VERY USEFUL APP!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, works well with lots of different formats."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Opens pdf wrong"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a solid program I got it to replace the program I was using since the old one will soon be banned in my country. I wish it had a manual. I need to work with encrypted files and the default save format opens in read-only. Took me a few days to figure out they had to be on .doc to be able to edit them. Several weeks down the line and i am back to read only on all my documents. Ok got it editing again. Had to save in different format again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üíØüòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good app, lots of options which are easy to access. However the app could not open a microsoft office pdf document. This was the main reason I intalled the app on my android device. I even got the full version of the app but still could not open the pdf document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really best app I've used on phone.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good, cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I tried this for thirty minutes and it was useless. BAD: Enormous, full-screen popup ads. WORSE: When I closed them, the file I was laboriously typing was utterly obliterated, leaving a blank, empty document. That happened twice. Ditto when I tried to minimize the app to copy some text from an email."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's awesome... My experience was so epic.. I am really in the need of open office and I randomly found this aap...and start using it regulraly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very bad. There is no Open Office Base available."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It used to be difficult to use. The authors have made huge improvements over the years, it is now a fully-useable office suite. One of its greatest advantages is, it does all the things the desktop version does (as far as I can tell), and all menus, buttons etc. are in the same place so you don't need to learn thigs again! Plus, of course, there (seems to be) 100% compatibility with documents/spreadsheets between the Desktop and Android apps. Bravo!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent replacement for MS office and affordable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This application has a lot of power behind it. The UI definitely requires rework due to windows not being easy to close or resize and the advertisements when exiting. If that can be fixed I'd never use anything else. This has more potential than others."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"üò°"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Adds dontloadso cantclose them"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"best app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As I only use a few time per year and having free access it's great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I've used it little in the past, but it's difficult and obstinate now. Worst is when a drop-down covers everything underneath, and won't close. (Yesterday did it REALLY slide neatly back up out of the way???) Or just as bad, sometimes it's all black, and I can't tell if anything's written there. Sometimes the ""FILE EDIT VIEW, etc."" isn't there, and I don't know what those little pictures are supposed to mean, but I MIGHT accidentally get what I need. HELP!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I want to thank you for this app. When my general health and eyesight went downhill (I'm 82), I moved my computing from a Linux desktop to this tablet. I had used OpenOffice and then LibreOffice for years to produce many documents, including a refereed scientific journal for eight years and two full-length books. So you can imagine my dismay at not finding an Android office suite comparable to LibreOffice. Then I discovered AndrOpen Office. What a relief!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Documents, especially tables, don't transfer well from PC-version. It is quite difficult to edit. Also the adds are a pain when you open and close multiple documents in a short timespan. I was expecting better from Open Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Yo mama."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Keep having macro security change after I change it to low. It goes back to high for some reason."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"WAY better than an annual subscription to Microsoft Office 365. The only down side I see is if the window minimizes on my tablet, all work done before last save disappears. Using a keyboard with a tablet works well, and a bamboo pen to touch the small areas to do what you need to do makes the experience easier. Other than that, OPEN SOUCE, YA'LL! So helpful. Thank you for putting it all together for our use! Addition: always SAVE YOUR WORK! Deletes very easily; still great"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app don't download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great App. Almost the same as Libreoffice but optimizwd for Chrome book, Optioms are easier to understand and screen display much better. If you know and love Libreoffice stick with it, If you don't feel comfotrable with it, this the app for your word prosessor, spread sheet, etc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It works okay but it's full of ads! It's really annoying to download an application called OpenOffice then deal with a lot of ads. Sorry but I cannot recommend this one (although it seems like a good port, opens password protected files right away, zoom is good, etc). And it is pricey!"

Seriously. :) You gotta get used to how the controls work, as this is a different is platform from Windows or GNU/Linux, and so the creator has arranged certain controls rather differently out of necessity. But most if it is completely familiar. Wonderful! Tip: AndrOpenoffice will work best in landscape mode! Now I just hope updates don't turn it into a mess."

No, I want to open the one in my email. I shut off this office app, go back to my email and click the attachment to open again. And voila, the same ad. And this cycle goes on and on."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"If I was not using this app on a mobile device then this app would be great. But because it is an a mobile device it's not that great. It feels like it's almost an exact port over from PC which isn't bad. But just like PC it requires a mouse and keyboard. I would though encourage people to try on something like a tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard. It would probably offer a way better experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Much better than similar apps on most languages and fonts decoding and affordable subscription. One major issue left to do is to modernize the outdated, very hard to use on touch screen and totally non practical document editor UI."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Sometimes it runs slowly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is the most generic app I have ever seen. You would be better off using a note app on your phone than try to use this even on a computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's a very cool app...I see good things coming from this it just needs a little more cleaning and definition especially with the icons. The icons look very old school. Altho I'm very hopeful it will be better with time."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use it to view spreadsheets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I need a full-strength word processor - this is the best one. It looks and feels like MS Word, and that is what I'd use in my non-Android applications - for MS Windows, Word as bundled in the Office applications. AndrOpen is easy to use (I use it with a small bluetooth keyboard and mouse) and is fast. Absolutely intuitive, too. It's the best and I got the full version. This is for those that need a powerful word processor. I like it a lot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hi can you make this available for non-google play users"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use Open Office on my Android tablet lot. It is excellent for writen documents, spreadsheets and presentations. This is probably the best app for an Android device short of paying Microsoft. I have found one issue and and that is if you create *.doc written documents and send them out in emails some recipients don't see all of the document. Lines of text will be missing. I solved this problem by using another app to convert the *.doc document to *.docx and then there are no problems."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Kutta kamina me tera kuhn pii jaunga"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It can't open any document on my internal storage without internet connection! For instance, if I am on field (which is pretty often now) with very poor mobilenet and no wifi connection and I need to quickly open a doc on my phone I'm done. Advertising is OK for me when I'm using this app and have internet connection too. But... So without connection it's a piece of...you know what!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"First, I wish to have the pro version but the upgrade link doesn't work. After a few days of use, I have to say this is an outstanding app! I have tried all others and wish I had found yours first! It should be at the top of search! Please, if you have a moment, check the upgrade link. It will be a pleasure to contribute to your great work! UPDATE: After uninstalling and reinstalling, the upgrade link worked. Well worth the price!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I just obtained an Android tablet and had no way to edit my cover letter for a job! Wow Thank you for this app availability & compatibility!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"perfect for on the go"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fine apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Just what I needed. An app that allows us to open many types of documents and edit it, with minimal ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"even though its old version I really love it easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oh wow this is like the old fashioned layout that I used to use back in the day... so much easier for me to understand... this is such a blessing - I'm hoping the full version really does the job - it's very reasonable to purchase"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A very good app. Some suggestions for improvement would be ‚Äê 1. To reduce the width of the list box that displays the cell position and increase the width of the box for editing the content of the cell. 2. When selecting a cell for editing, it would be convenient if it would also open one's preferred key board. David"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use as good as Microsoft office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app! Decided to support it only ten minutes after installation and got the payed version, without ads. Worth every euro. Now I can work on my documents created in LibreOffice on my Samsung tablet. Highly recommend it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Either my thumb is to big or the app has an issue. I can't edit odg files comfortably. It selects a tool I don't need and I can't go back to what I was doing unless I restart the app. and it happens again lot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It takes a while to figure out the nuances but it's very close to the Open Office version. I like it."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpen Office is a great way way to read and edit Microsoft and open document formats on your phone or tablet. I've used it for years. The developer has consistently improved the usability of a good product to an excellent one. I've successfully run this app on quite basic hardware (Nvidia Shield tablet and Samsung On5 and A20). I'm going to shell out for the paid version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It has so many boxes obscuring the data or document you are trying to read. Probably good on a laptop horrible on a mobile."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good. I wanted something that could open/convert old excel docs (Excel 365 couldn‚Äôt, lol), and found it can import CSV files as well (something else I needed). It does a very good job of making the desktop experience work on a mobile phone."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Looks nice and all but exceptionally useless since there's no on screen keyboard. How do you plug a real keyboard into a tablet? Other reviewers say that is necessary."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks Open office for existing! Love the app! I found the app name confusing when trying to download, but see that it is the same Open Office I always used on my computer. Thanks again for another Brilliant open source application THAT WORKS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app is good but doesn't have alll the things necessary"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly on my cell phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super Super Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very convenient for allowing OpenOffice files to be worked with on Android, good support, add-ons, thoughtful updates. Overall a use and very appreciated tool. Thank you developers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works seamlessly with open org docs on my pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app works just like the desktop programs. Almost a clone of MS Office but with better versatility and features."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for my chromebook. The ads only pop up when you close down OpenOffice. Thank you for allowing me this app. But you could do without nagging me to upgrade. :) But it is fine. I can use this now to upload my stories on Fictionpress."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is visually beautiful And i really want to like it for my Samsung Tablet but it doesn't work in the most fundamental ways. You cannot select text and apply any formatting. You can set italics but only one word at a time. Any editing is impossible. Most of the features of Open Office are there but they simply don't work. Don't waste your time on this app. So disappointing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"A five star app that leaves you with two stars with the grubby adds"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Have to pay for upgrade to print anything. Other free apps print for free."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I'm giving this app 5 stars even though it only just finished w/ install. I have the reg version on my desktop. I have loved OpenOffice since my husband first installed it 2-3 years ago. I only used it for the Word Processing mode w/ never an issue & will most likely use it that way for my Mobile, (Galaxy Note 8). However, if I can make my hobbies/crafts allows me to make a few $, then I will use the app as a book keeper. For now, it's a TBC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I searched several apps to meet my needs for writing, and this one is the only one that is easy to use, and met my expectations"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I didn't ask it to turn on, and it keeps doing it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love it so much so far. However there should be some new functions in the Spreadsheet like Maxifs, Averageifs,... which are included in Excel 2019"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It nice!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I believe that this app suite works very well. Because I currently use this from a tablet without a mouse, I need to spend more time to see if I can give it 5 stars(It might be me). The commercial comes at the end of session, is not annoying, actually quite respectfully done. Having an effective office suite that does not need an internet connection, and does not data mine is important for the world not just me. As I used it more with more peripherals I can re-rate it again Thank You Andr"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can i use fontwork in this app? ?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've had this for a short while now, and so far it is the most 'Office' like office app I've used. It can be a little slow on some things, but that's probably just my low-ish end Chromebook rather than the app. I may well buy this! EDIT- Bought and not regretted. Still the best office app for Chrome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well as a standin for the main launching platform which requires a licence"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best Android Office app without doubt. A bug noted recently: If I open an odt file from file browser, it is read only. But when opening through Andropen office, it's fine. File location: sdcard, Device: Huawei Media pad M5 Lite / Android 8."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ok. You guys need to chill. It just bugs me that the very first time we open an app after installation the first thing we see is a pop-up asking me to write a review. How can I write an honest review when I'm stopped at the front door?!?"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Needs to work on it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The user interface leaves much to be desired, but as far as I can tell everything works as it should. Using a stylus makes it easier. It offers more features than MS Word for less than a twelfth of the price. Even the free version offers more than Word. Totally worth it."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. Upgraded to the pro version to access NAS storage but it crashes back to the file manager screen before displaying file content"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very bad. I tried changing my Default font to my system font but it would not do it. The font colors won't change and I haven't heard back from the developer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great, replaced the evil empire Microsoft."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't download it's a wasted time bakwaas"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ideal office app for android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I would love to know why my honest comments about this app have magically disappeared."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hi This app is very good This app has helped me a lot I would like to give 30 stars to this app But it's not possible Thank you so much I love this app I appreciate God bless the person who created this app Thanks Again big thanks from Haryanaü§óüòã"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've used this in the past with a terrible phone. Now that I have a better smart phone... I plan on taking full advantage of such amazing software app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome job, Akikazu. Much more functionality than other ""Office"" apps I've tried. Love it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Can't open star office document with extension sdw Pl help"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not free for use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"corrupted my files beyond recovery, doesn't even recognize that I opened and edited the files in the ""recent documents"" tab...use at your own risk."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"A few bugs but otherwise very good. It is based on a copy Linux Open Office. I recotmmend it. If it wasn't so expensive I would pay for it to avoid the irritating ads. Please continue the good work. 4 Dev 2020 Update I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS APP! Why? Because I have now run into so many locked features, all available in FREE Linux OpenOffice, which AndrOpenOffice is copied from FREE of charge. This is an attempt to FORCE YOU TO PAY for this app. It is mostly unusable. DEINSTALLING!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Keyboard not working can't type nothing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far this writing tool as proven very useful. But as I have only used the basics of it I don't feel comfortable in giving an in depth review. I've still only used the basics - but now I'm going to try editing an image and add text."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very nice app I am using it to do practical of computer It is recommended by my school on the behalf of computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Polaris office 5 has way less ads. Both have the same negative though. Say you find an article you want to keep. Forget the pictures unless you put each one in manually. My clip board had everything copied perfectly, but when pasted no pics. Not even one. The other main negitive I found was this app is no good on a small screen. The S.G.S5 is a good example here. It does have a lot of nice features if you have a stylus and a screen to cast to."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So nice app for school word like seens of dav public school"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works really well with mouse and keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Don't support database. Many problem, like don't support new table database program. Please fix this problem. And database system in Andropen office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't install, totally sucks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't view/read any file without being in 'edit' 'writing' mode...rendering entire Open Office app useless on my Android device. Does NOT respond to icon toggle prompting whatsoever to even view in user friendly format. Useless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cant print anything without paying for an upgrade."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really excellent app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Update: I have confirmed that other WP programs, like SoftMaker CAN use custom fonts, so something has gone wrong with this version. Very sad... Just migrated to a new tablet running Android 10 instead of 6 and now the custom fonts don't seem to work?! I swear I've set it up just like before, but I still can't use the fonts. This is SUPER important to be able to type in certain languages. Huge bummer..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am using the writer only and finding it five stars. I have no idea about the other components."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A very good appüëåüëåüëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Spreadsheet is a nightmare. You have to use your same finger to scroll as you would to select cells for a function. I end up selecting all kinds of cells I don't want and the first option giving is to delete everything instead of undo the mistake you just made."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Ugh. Irritating ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent spreadsheet app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's nice to use."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Very clunky & non-intuitive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The idea is great! Work on a file on the phone. I got super excited and lived it in the biginning. Then reality caught up with me an in practice on my phone it s not working out well. It gets stuck often and i have difficulties working the file. Reading is difficult as well. Maybe it will get better once i get more familiar with the tricks and treats of the app. I m optimistic. Keep on going ‚ô§"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Excel sheet not support cross sheets calculation multiple sheets.... Poor open office. I try sum up my data in excel but when I open I got Ref#"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Must include database"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very nice App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Loved it in all respect, it's just like working on computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"terrible. as a word processor fine anything else dire."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good it is good and I can do everything which is in laptop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't download it, it is a unpleasant ads are forced to see near to 10 seconds."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great office program does everything the expensive programs do and more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's nice , I like it and our school teachers prefer this."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A bit insistent and naggy at times. But that should clear up on bying it, and it's not unfair. It is worth buying, and is far more honest then some programs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Loaded with ADs.... screen becomes non responsive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ok ok."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice to do work as well as my children can do their school work in this app üòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not bad. It could be more intuitive to use. I do not like having to crop an image with sizes, rather than drag handles."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Pro version - Editing text into a spreadsheet has lots of problems, text not appearing, shift causes previous cell to be inserted. I'm requesting a refund."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Marvellous and useful! Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This works better than any other Office clone. My only complaint is you have to use a keyboard. I can not use the Virtual keyboard at all. But that is very very minor compared to its functionality."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's too good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a very nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I paid for the ""Pro"" version after it kicked me out of my file I was working on (my budget file) and now it will not open on anything because the password will not work. I open this file daily and I know the password is correct. Thanks, the free version worked fine but now Iam locked out of a year worth of financial work and a robust spreadsheet I created. I now have to start over, I just paid for loosing my data. I would like my money back."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a terrible app. It is not user friendly.There apparently is no way to save a file."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"There is no writing option in Desktop mode, sir please tell me what to do?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bhaaaaaaag Yaha se"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Doesn't work for password protected Excel files good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app for users who are on chromebook and want Open Office Writerüëçüëçüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Clunky, but still the best Open Office available on small screen. About time Apache brought us the real thing I reckon."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"unable to change default setting on page. cant find a way to save a file using yhe default pages"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Powerful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Does not install fully without taking steps to install components, like language packs, for dictionaries to work. My odt files do not look or format the same on Chromebook (this app) as they do on desktop Open Office, but that might be result of lack of fonts on app. However, advanced users, who pay for full version, can probably make use of this app. Also, if you just need a word processor/office suite on Android for basic documents, this app is perfect. I'm an author and publisher"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Plese my Andropen office is work smoothly by I work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot, Akikazu yoshikawa you are a master, this app allowed me to work on the train and anywhere, it's very well done. Origato."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great alternative to WPS who has non-existent support. Using on Kindle Fire. Having some minor issues but this is a new port from Open Office so not complaining. Is much easier to use than WPS. Looking forward to future improvements."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"So bad app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is in the way,worthless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"sometimes the windows in the disply were too big but that was ok. and i love the export pdf feature everything else just like desktop version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not able to use this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My teacher have said to write any thing in open office but that time laptop has not charged then this is app has helped me that was the way I am giving 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Many more features than the ""free"" MS Word and it creates "".doc."" compatible files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Beware this doesnt work well on android phones. Yoy can get sucked into buying thid when you font know it. NO REFUNDS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Am used to desktop version, this is awkward on my notepad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good application!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Weau wow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Yah bahut kam Kara"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good so far still have much to learn experience good so far works great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is good but it hanged too much so I give it 3 star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It works, but not well. Lots of weird stuff happens and sometimes the spreadsheet freezes and I can't even save. I couldn't get spellcheck to work in French nor in Spanish. The recent documents feature doesn't work. Also not a big fan of ads on an app that's basically LibreOffice for android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app but ,but make my 6gb ram phone slower"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app must be a joke."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Total rubbish- unreal for 10"" Tablet users - crashes when saving - needs a lot more investing in a workable version - who would spend money on rubbish like this??"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is stoping in middle"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. No need of Computer at ALL!! Mouse function works better then laptop. Well configured, Great Job..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's not very functional"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Could not type anything caused a dialog worning to kepp popping no use to me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Adds is one thing, but serving ads that play very loud music is unacceptable"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly! Yes, there is a small, one off purchase cost to remove ads but it sure beats the subscription models the big boys want us to use. Probably the first thing you will want to do, is disable autofill in spreadsheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP. Would be nice to add the possibility to select text (words, sentences or paragraphs), by touching the text on the Android screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great sex"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Hanged a lot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"User friendly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This should be free but why it shows ads???"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its very worker app.I save my office documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good but not very interesting"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My school mam sad me to download this app for presentation I don't now how the app is ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use with lots of power"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"V.V.Very Amazing app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super üíü"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far it feels like an old friend and very powerful. I'm still dealing with ads and receiving requests to upgrade after I allready have. Still very good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I appriciate japaneese technologies"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the real deal! No 'simplification' (=dumbing down and losing functionalities), no life enslavement (=yearly subscription and obligation to be online), a completely functional port that works. Thanks a lot to the developer!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is not good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is better than word"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Auto fill is not working. Resizing of coulmn width is very difficult."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"‡≤è‡≤®‡≤ø‡≤¶‡≥Å ‡≤ï‡≤ø‡≤§‡≥ç‡≤§‡≥ã‡≤ó‡≤ø‡≤∞‡≥ã"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I originally tried this app a couple of years ago and it did not perform well. Now I am using it on my Chromebook and it performs a stellar job. I'm very happy with how the developers have taken feedback and made the app better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Best mobile computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app has enabled me to read and edit documents and spreadsheets I created on my Laptop in Open Office on my Android tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great replacement of MS Office. Not a memory hog like Microsoft office and Google. If it had less ads, it would be perfect."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is the libre office android nobody wanted but everybody needed. I do not have any idea how they managed to make a small apk version of full libre office. Very good job. Needs a bit optimising though"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"USER interface and features need to be improved and please make it mobile friendly and add FULL DESKTOP FUNCTION"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The all tools are looked how to open them"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üôÇ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Went through several apps looking for one that actually works without spending, signing up or giving too many permissions. This one is it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great super featured product with some minor issues. First and most important this is not a SUBSCRIPTION which you pay monthly or yearly. This is a license one-time full access to many features. Not only is it FREE unless you want the full-featured licensed version which is very inexpensive one-time payment, but it is also the most complete Android office of about 6 other choices I reviewed, and all the others where subscriptions only. Bugs are fixed, developer communicates!! Still the best,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very good for my computer classes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very hard to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is Exceptionally ugly and unintuitive to use. It's almost purely a straight port of OpenOffice with some (still not very well done) Android UI added on. Due to this, a keyboard and mouse is almost a necessity. A stylus makes it workable as well. I would not recommend this for word documents, spreadsheets or presentations (the latter didn't even load). However, Draw is the full fat desktop programme. I've searched for a long time, and there's nothing else like it available for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I just downloaed it right now as of now i just like it's physical feature it's just like you are working with pc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excelent office app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Bought upgrade but on starting app, non upgraded version often kicks in, making the whole thing useless as it won't let me open my OneDrive file to work on. Have I wasted my money or is there a fix?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a difficult app to use but this is important for me because it is used to type text on each festival each day each each people and more for use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"just perfect with Samsung Dex"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I'm used to using to working with computers and having a keyboard and mouse to work with. The younger kids may be capable of hunting and pecking with two thumbs, but I've been working with computers for decades now and just find it difficult to make the transition to performing the same tasks I do on a daily basis. The app may be fully capable of performing the tasks of the desktop version, but I find it difficult to work without the usual tools of the trade."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üëåüëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Bestsellers application!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice appp"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I would buy this App. But. Google: taught my 8 year old daughter to steal using there payment system, denied any responsibility and did nothing to prevent a repeat. So I will never purchase with Google. This is sad, the developer deserves better. The App gets better every update. Androids lack of persistence causes problems when you leave a sheet open but that is true for everything. Remember to save your data."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"After all the pitiful attempts to implement open office on android, this is a breath of fresh air. It imports CSV files flawlessly. Great job!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It was awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app is not so easy to use. There are good editing features. Probably in future updates there would be improvement"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Finally got it right. Great app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This office is part and parcel of life . Even it has more features than other offices app .My reason for giving it 4 stars that in spreadsheet the alphabets of my languages are not fully shown . The upper part of word hides behind the cells . This is not acceptable. Otherwise this is brilliant office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It corrupted few of my files after saving. General error input/output error"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is good if anyone do not have computer this is a very useful app. It is same as computer openoffice writter.But it sometimes hang so I have given 4 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. It does require a bit of thinking in order to use, but is getting easier with every update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very slow. Unusable for even viewing a doc on a phone, let alone editing it. Uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a very good Office app with a Microsoft type user interface. It does exactly what I want . The customer support is quick and outstanding. Highly recommended! EDIT Oh dear! I had to reinstall it and it appears that there is no longer a Polish spell check. EDIT. Again many thanks for your quick reply! I have found the Polish dictionary/ Spell checker. Great!!. Tools- Language- More dictionaries online."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is very nice app for students because it helps students to do computer based work those students who do not have pc please download this app it have extra features also this is very helpful my suggestion is download this app üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçI WILL GAVE 5STARS TO THIS APP"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's very difficult to work in this application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Nothing is saving for me. I save something but all that is saved is the file name. On every computer I have owned I have put open office on to it. This is the first tablet and it's not working."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Umha.... so lovely"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worthless garbage. Trying to do the most basic edits in any document is infuriating. Printing is a premium featuure, and I'm not paying anyone a dime for this failure of an app. It doesn't work anything like the hundeds of other apps I've used, accross all platforms, that involve text input. The only reason I still have it is so I can read office documents on my phone, and even that basic function is annoying."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"WoW"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is hard but improve theüò°"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is starting to have small problems and if I have to pay to print then I'm done with them"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is really a useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Super but it can't be full screen on phone üì±"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"BAD. WHEN I AM TRYING TO SAVE ITS NOT SAVING. TELLING ANDR.OPENOFFICE KEEPS STOPPING."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I purchased this app in spite of all the negative reviews and I love it. I tried my best to get it to crash, lose data, etc, but despite all my efforts, it worked perfectly. I believe most, if not all, of the issues people had were user errors. Yes, the commands are close together, but, what do you expect on a 10"" tablet or phone screen, so use a mouse and keyboard. I will use this app instead of my computer because this is more convenient. This app actually exceeded my expectations."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Be warned, the free version does not let you print..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,". Very Detailed. Good Orientation. Much More To Learn. . Future. Will Reevaluate. ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Why on earth does it separate the screen in two? The upper part shows nothing and the document appears in the part below and it's of course terribly small. Sorry it's impossible to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It looked okay on the surface but, it struggled to load a file that takes seconds to load in Excel."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works OK for word processing for tiny screen, but I can't comment on the spreadsheet as I haven't used it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Far and away the best word processing app I have found for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As√≠ fue de que te lo aparece mensaje poco espacio soy de lo mismo , as√≠ aunque de m√≠ no ten√≠a espacio y lo vuelvo a todo coraz√≥n"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use, the pro upgrade works as advertised, and the interface is generally pretty easy to use. There are a few areas that could use improvement, but overall it works great, and it's the only usable editor I've found for ods files on Android. Also, the developer is generally pretty quick to respond to support emails."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Advertising intrusive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An amazing app that allows me to use my tablet to write and edit text flawlessly. And I translate books, so any minor problem would stand out. What's more, after commenting on a minor issue in a version, the developer answered immediately, and I do mean immediately, and it got solved in a matter of days. Hats off to that."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"SO BAD üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"So difficult for using"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Word documents open without any problem.I have been using other other word software for the past 35 years but I feel a different experiance in reading and creating word documents with Andropen office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Well.....We'll see i suppose"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well on Chromebook EXCEPT for saving updates to files. A ""Save"" results in an error and no save, ""Save as"" will work, but will NOT replace the old version. Requires you to rename the new one afterwards."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Abhinav"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The app has a long way to go. I've used the desktop version for years but this app needs work. I can't insert an image. When trying to insert an image it looks in it's own file storage where there are no images. It says to click the + button to add images, however there is no + button that you can click on. It won't allow you to search for images in your own computer files. Very frustrating."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"World best app I have seen it does everything like a computer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"2 seconds of using and i already encountered a bug. I was typing then press the return key, the whole word that i was typing disappeared, then i typed another, the word that i previously typed appeared with the new letters i just typed in.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Hello Yoshikawa,I'm very appreciated with this app because its UI is coincident to Windows desktop one.However,because of this reason,this app's UI may be unsuitable using at smartphone's OS.I truly hope you'd improve it (e.g. use big icons & menu bars).Besides,this app's size is also too giant.Some non-core features (e.g. drawing) may split out for another separate app in order to reduce this app's size.Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not that as expected"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use this to my tablet, just like in my laptop. user Friendly. Though other toolbars are not available."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice app.i loved it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AppIsGood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Lots of detail and options, most of which you'll never use... Word is *slightly* better at that (for those who won't complain when Microsoft runs away with your data) if you can pay, but I actually prefer this. Amazon Apps has Writer+ which is better for general use, but this one is fine. Ads are a minor annoyance at worst, so buy if you can afford to get rid of them, but I didn't bother."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't allow you to move to SD. Like most bloatware, takes up too much RAM/phone memory....."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Effort appreciated. This is a forked project. Since the source project is for PC, the interface of this fork may not look user friendly for mobile small screen. I'd suggest to remove the bells and whistles of source project from default settings and let mobile users rely solely on menu bar (3 horizontal parallel lines on top right). And a QuickStart video could help new users, especially those who have not used Open Office and PC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"üòç Nice app ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Can you please make it more comfortable for android .This is my humble request. Please!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"slow scrolling"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I only used ""calc"" so far and I'm not convinced. It works, but only if you have a mouse and keyboard connected to your android device. It is as if the developer had never tested his software on a touchscreen device. The control buttons are so terribly small and close together that the interface is unusable. Also comes with very intrusive video ads! This is not a ""free"" app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A very useful app for being productive when mobile."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"4 star, just because we cant change PAGE ORIENTATION IN TEXT DOCUMENT TYOE AND CANT EXPORT AS .DOC OR .DOCX FILE TYPE. KINDLY IMPROVE THESE SMALL THINGS OVERALL APP PERFORMANCE AND WORKING FEATURES ARE QUIET GOOD."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"When typing the program repeats words. Sometimes it refuses to let me type what i want. It does not behave like the PC version. No complaints, this is offered as a suggestion for improvement. Im sure eventually you programmers will work out the bugs. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Considering tiny phone screen, far nicer to use than Google Sheets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Always loved this product. It does everything the competition and support is great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Found it a wonderful app. There's an issue of typing with Local or Regional Language what should be fixed out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is nothing short of a perfect solution to finally getting an ODF-compatible utility on Android. It certainly does look a little strange considering it's running OpenOffice inside an X window server, but it certainly does work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I was hoping for a good alternative to Google Sheets. It didn't work out for me. Just too cumbersome."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful for my online computer class I do practical on this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent on tablets but with few compromises for smalker screen on phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well. Phones just aren't good for word processing. Does what I need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It would be better if being included with Indian regional languages. 2.Yuktakshyara does not creat correct form.Examp: ‡¨™‡¨∞‡¨Æ‡¨™‡¨∞‡¨æ‚ùå ‡¨™‡¨∞‡¨Æ‡≠ç‡¨™‡¨∞‡¨æ‚úîÔ∏è"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Slow, very slow, I can't see a simple spreadsheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it is very coll app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An amazing full feature word processor suite that can be used on your phone! Extremely intuitive design makes creating and editing documents easy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I'm giving it 5 star just because of the mathematical font. It is very useful for typing the MATHEMATICS formulas and equations. Little bit coplicated to find out the formulas but once you found out it will be easy. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I like the desktop interface. I went ahead a paid for full version. Only used just shortly. During that time some things I noticed. While I can scroll the screen up and down really, scrolling right and left barely works. Also after editing and saving a file I can no longer open in MS Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"At least as far as Text Document is concerned - 5+ stars, However, better support for slideshow .ods is needed. BUG: Cropped images in ODS don't show correctly. (i) I wonder if no auto-correct Super/Sub script text is due to the app or Android; willing to see this, and then you have a full document-editor on a tablet/Android!!! (ii) Reduce greyspace on the sides of pages for maximal screen usage (iii) Ribboned interface like libreoffice 5.3"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not so good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately this app was stopped"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its amazing app . I suggest to use this app,if you don't have PC .üëèüëèüëèüëè"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love the multifunctability"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to used"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very Nice app....If you do like to have just the PC like interface on Android this is the perfect app...Do not go for apps by Microsoft they are just advertising platforms for Office 365............Only one thing I would like to say is that there is also a paid version..We are already having ads and ApacheOpenOffice is free of cost so I would recommend that please remove the paid version and make all features available in the free versionüòÉüòÉ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just what everyone needs on Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Much improved, tried this version of open office a while ago, was cluttered and not practical, however, decided to try it again and it is vastly improved since the early days. More usable on a small screen, on a tablet with external keyboard and mouse it is very good. I actually don't need MS office formats as all my outgoing documents are converted to PDF, so why pay the MS subscription?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"its time efficient"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app...it gets a lot of work done!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works great. However on android phones you're not allowed to print anything out with the free version. Yet on the laptop you can print things out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super recent app...love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can't find a way to highlight text to copy/paste. A window comes up on top with no options to highlight any text. Uninstalled..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app to use for all the types of office documents. It's not user friendly at all. Any document loads with n no of useless options like for pdf why do I have to edit directly for opening a document for the first time?? If at all I need it I'll open the option right why to dump the screen open with all the options?? Also every document opening loads zoomed out and with so minute icons we can't figure out which icon is for what purpose so the screen resolution is also messed up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good and fully in functions"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Difficult to use bold, italics, and underline, must save work constantly or risk having whatever you wrote deleted when you go to check something on another app, even if you don't close this app, which just happened to me. Four pages gone with no way to bring it back, because I was looking up how to spell a name and when I brought the app back up from the still open list, the entire document was gone because the app 'reloaded'."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a very excellent text processor, much like Word"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No, doesn't work at all. Not able to view any open Office files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Good app specialty when you don't have laptop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app for Android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fixed! favourite app for many years.. however.. I'm having some issues with it on Chromebook OS, it keeps crashing every few minutes. This has never happened on android or windows with this app. hope you can find a bug fix soon. I just upgraded to professional pack in hope this may solve the issue. tbc.. So I had issues on Chrome OS with the standard app, a good few gripes as well as the above but I finally bought professional pack and English lang pack. 5 out of 5 stars.. Better than ever!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This application is superb quality for cals.üôáüëèüëèüëè"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"How to increase row and column size"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Incredible app! Solved a myriad of needs for me! Reasonably priced, LOTS of extensions and add-ons."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a very good app.being retired it's very fine that it's not another thing I have to pay for even though I would not mind contribution. Thank you for your fine. Signed Richard"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to access most, if not all, functions in a common sense way. We'll laid out format, especially on a phone. Excellent way to tell Word to stick it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is good if you're using the android OS on a desktop or laptop system, maybe even a tablet connected to a keyboard and mouse and monitor. But it's not ideal for the phone. Update: im using it on a tablet with a bluetooth mini keyboard which helps. But now it needs a dark mode."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly. Has lot of issues...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works very well on phone and tablet. Good work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not response short cut"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Above 2 m.b xlsx files loading too slow... Cant open. Im using Samsung M30s while M.S office running smoothly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"almost perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app.l like it.‚ù§Ô∏èüëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Generally very good, given the constraints implicit in Android. Sometimes it isn't possible to switch between keyboard and mouse mode, but that may not be your fault. I use LibreOffice on the main machine, and AndrOpen Office is useful for quick edits in (for example) documents sent by email, when I'm not at home."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The only app that .doc files with Farsi font is showing correctly as on PC's microsoft word."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great for using with libre office desktop straightforward to use for everyone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this as I have a lot of open office files, when I opened it, it was totally non functional, non responsive, waste of time and data. Immediately uninstalled it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mast app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice aap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app, but it is not user friendly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I would like to be able to make adjustments to shadows, like intensity, direction. Also I would like to export to Power Point format in an easier way, I would like to crop pictures in an easier way, while designing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Have been using it recently."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app, feels like desktop open office. I will give 5 üåü if few bugs resolved. Double click column width extension not working and sometimes hangs. The big problem is that sheet is moving on desktop layout. need stable work sheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good app, but it lacks all the necessary fonts"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good nice üòçüòçüòç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Randomly assumes deleted data is being undeleted when you resume typing. The grammar system is super fail tastic. It's completely unable to understand possessive, plural, pre and suf-fix rules."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Bhadiya hay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Pro's. Stable and reliable. Only full featured OpenDocument office suite available. Seamless Dropbox support. Works well on a Chrome OS tablet. Supports input from onscreen keyboards. Con's: GUI is somewhat clunky, takes a learning curve. Does not support newer MS formats - must convert to OpenDocument formats. Overall: Good solution for my use case, may not be for everyone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OMG the best app it had everything i want and i rwally liked this i would definitely five 5 stars.to it. üòäüòäüòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The only reasonably priced application that will faithfully reproduce my LibreOffice (PC) documents. I tried some ""viewers"" but none would show my docs the way they were created. This is pretty cramped on a small screen but stick it on a larger tablet (Galaxy Tab S6) and it's quite usable. Attach a big screen to that and it's just like being on a desktop system. Well done! Happy to pay the price."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Old style, love it, has everything, then more."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's not downloading fas"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app it is very important app for doing work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Edit not available...use online.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Love the app, does everything I want of it, however, this latest version broke something fixed a few versions ago. That is updating it when the app has been moved to an SD card. To get the update to work I have to move the app back to Device storage, then after the update is complete move it back to the SD card. To be fair, this is an ancient tablet criminally short of internal storage, but it still works, so why should I replace it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is good, but the previous version is much better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just awesome app great hard word done by creater"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Remove Ads!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I feel this is the most comprehensive office suite out there. There are so many options that I doubt I'll ever be able to use them all. It is incredible to me to see that this app free. It's also nice to be able to show my appreciate for all the hard work that obviously was put into this app with donations. I have never liked paying a premium to pay for the advertising etc of a program. I will continue to support this app and it's matching program. Great job!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent alternative to microsoft office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Please return it to the version that has all the menu at the top of the application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ISSB"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I started with the middle star because I'm still down loading the app. From the middle star I can give it more or less star depending what I think of it after I use it. ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best ever"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is a very nice office app obtaining almost all tools, at least in my opinion. However its interface is odd and isn't a good UI design for android devices! I like it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful to be able to retain format on different device, after saving to drive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This App has many functions and works well. Some of the helps directions seem to come from the desktop version but can be figured out by trial and error."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed I spent half a day to work on a file under text document. I saved the work and the next day I found that the edited text was never saved. Now I have to spend more time to work on the file but without using AndrOpen Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Too much complicity"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The author of AndrOpen Office knows how to port an app! I am seriously impressed by the functionality available and desktop-like experience with no bubbly interface or mostly missing functions or menus. This app is flipping awesome!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very Good But it would be great if it was truely 100% compatible with Open Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works fine!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cluttered and not user-friendly. M gonna uninstall now"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app & very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"open office is the best of basic word processors and being of open arcatecture it is operation across all platforms."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great. Blown away by how well this works. Better on a tablet due to all the controls. Worth the upgrade."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cluttered and difficult to use interface. Near impossible to move the cursor position due to things popping up and keyboard hiding then showing. Ads are also extremely annoying and being asked (forced?) to give a rating when exiting only to be shown even more apps and then a purchase page, but not the app rating page, is a total fail."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Has many useful features such as format painter, convert to pdf, margin settings & more. Is comparable to a desktop style word app, I found this after installing many other office apps. Takes getting used to but it must be easier than most other apps. IM LOOKING for the way to ad my own fonts, that would make this complete for my use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is so good and as long as i have been using it. It's just so nice and has no problem"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Will update when I have time, but the whole program seems to be loosely cobbled together. Doesn't approach Openoffice. Still, a decent set of programs which will do a job you can be proud of"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This used to work very well 6 months ago. Now it has become so bug ridden it is unsable. I cannot find a very old version to install. When I enter text into a cell and then move to an adjacent cell, the text disappears. If I type in text into this next cell the text from the previous cell suddenly appears and the new text is appended. If i move go back to the first cell everything gets selected and suddenly select mode is now active. The first cell is still blank. DESTROYED MY SPREADSHEET."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exellent port to Android, simple way of being able to use ""office"" apps offline via ChromeBook or Android Phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Has many more options than MS office 4 android, or mobisystems OfficeSuite Pro. The most important is that neither Ofice or OfficeSuite spreadsheets support cell/range naming, but AndrOpen Calc does. The ability to name a cell, to use it as a constant in your formulae, can force you to needlessly add an entire row or column to contain the constant value. i.e. ... Bloat. MS Office as well as Office suite feel a little less cramped, but are also much less capable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless. Can't handle simple xls files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Good Open Office clone. But no printing? Strange. Ok, I'll try another one."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just as good as Microsoft office. Congrats on your coding."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Too mamy functions and too compact for my phone. To be fair, ot might work better on a more modern phone. By the same token I think my phone is GREAT !!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"gud"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app to use for checking files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super app.... Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My all free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"V good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Porting the desktop program like this would seem clunky, but it‚Äôs undeniably useful to have the near-full power of OpenOffice on an Android. And it‚Äôs not particularly slow, it‚Äôs usable even on older devices. Great work, and well worth the paid upgrade!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Is it a large app? Yup. Is the user interface clunky to use with a phone? Yup. Does it get the job done when other apps can't or won't? Yup. Does it do it for free? Yup."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This right here"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works really well on Chromebook."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well, would like to write sxls files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Has all I needed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Too much advertisement"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very very very very nice app for iPhone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A bid slow, but feature packed..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have been using AddrOffice for a long time now (not sure amount of years) and I used the desktop free Office suite without issues but, now after all this time they disabled the printing. No warning until you updated and during the COVID pandemic (and need Gov't papers printed). I noticed this no print on the previous version before recent update. Bet no virus this no print without upgrading to pay version would never occurred. Now will uninstall and use Docs To Go even though this one better!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible and glitchy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. It is really good. Thank you soo much."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hey moron why is there no help support file? How do you change the text process page from potrait to landscape? Very poor app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Although it can still be developed further but I am happy with it's capabilities..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works the way you want it to. I upgraded for that reason. Exactly like the PC version of open office. Does everything and mire"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"has improved tremendously since I last used"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is great for working"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Third class"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you so much for making this app It becomes much useful for android or iOS users. Firstly, It was little hard to use it but after some days using it, It looked extremely useful. It has much options to work as like ""Open Office"".Very Very Thank you team who made this app. May your team become Great Thanks!!!üòäüòäüòäüòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Please add Bengali language and font"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use this for everything! Minimal compatibility issues and intuitive layout, Thanks Oo I love your work:)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"new update fail to change a list in cell.. please repair it. Thx"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is my go to app for editing odt files.Period."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best app for Chromebook"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"My Dropbox files are consistently corrupted when I open them with this app. The interface is also incredibly subpar. People only use this app because there is sadly no better option."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Reasonable office apps with Draw also. Add-Ons is optional for user to pick it based on need. Draw without physical mouse and physical keyboard were possible while user went travel or other activities."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice...very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"great app, just what was needed for open documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. In the first look you may not be excited by the lightweight simple handful view. But if you test it u will find any thing you want. Full hotkey shortcuts. Excellent mousepad. Supporting rtl if we enable from options. A complete office set. and Free."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful in-home, away from the master files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Is a little quirky trying to edit, but it does work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Your app like ms word desktop now I run desktop word in my mobile without any desktop or laptop thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I feel very happy while it as it provides facility to do project on my phone also because of absence of computer. But I come over some problems something."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use this on a Tablet. Have tried using it on a smartphone but found it impossible due to the size of the screen. There are the odd gliches but usually manage to complete the exercise I set out to achieve. Often, I use the PC to fine tune the document later."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Real legend of Mobile office applications."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's very useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works when others don't or won't"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"a little laggy, a little finicky. keyboard doesn't come up when you tap the writing area, you have to tap a small button on the side. UI size is OK for a tablet but not great, don't want to think about how small it'd be on a phone. not a bad option though"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great üëç...easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An outstanding piece of work! Really well done. Perfect for people who like to use open document format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Well, just downloaded it but it seems like what I've been looking for.Its cool though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üòäüòÄ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Have always been a fan of open source. This is my go to app for word processing et al. This app used to have Androports add on, which for some strange reason do not work. Another disappointment is though having paid for the professional upgrade years back, i now am beingasked to upgrade. Hope the developer resolves these issues. Had mailed him on tge Androports issue without much success. Hence the 4 stars. Love this app though. Actually diff email acct used. The upgrade works from that acct."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Print not included, no use to me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful program!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"works great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great for working with all types of MS Office files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"please can u make it accessible on android 4.0.0 . Nice app I suggest u add a full qwerty keyboard with the shortcut keys and a mouse pad . Check that from androports and hackers keyboard.The mouse pad is very needed.please .Also can u include search engines to it so we can surf the web easily."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't edit files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent app, i never seen this features in any apps. features are just like a windows. I feal my android phone like a windows 10. Thank you very much."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Simply putting, it is phenomenal. With this app you truly have a Desktop-Class office writing and editin app. It has a super useful feature, in my opinion, that lets the user convert its files from different formats into .PDF. Good work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible and rude - autoplays sound on random adverts. Without my permission, after opening a document, I suddenly heard random noise - it was an advert PLAYING SOUND without asking me. That's as rude as someone selling you a newspaper then every time you want to read it, some random guy blares speakers through your letterbox. I immediately uninstalled the app and they have lost revenue as I will click on ads that interest me, but I will not have anything to do with apps that are this rude"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As Close to Apache / libre open office as I could find"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great tool. Has functionality equivalent to the namebrands. Reads & writes formats of a multitude of other products. Great VALUE !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Tried many Office apps for Chromebook and this was the best. It had the most and easiest to use options and interface. It also mangled my carefully formatted Office files the least! One little annoyance is that when opening files, the list within a folder cannot be sorted."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Useless on a tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is very easy comfort for using and also I can use both writter, exell,draw, and power point. Very useful application üëå"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its good so far"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent, they could teach courses on this with all the features available."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Probably the best office suite available for phones and tablets. A faithful port of Open Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I pay full version, but it's not, just stolen money from people."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The free version serves too many ads that take over your small screen. These ads are intrusive and makes anyone hate this app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and to convert my old files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Now won't let you print without buying..DO NOT DOWNLOAD OPEN OFFICE WAS ALWAYS FREE NOW THEY FORCE YOU TO PAY!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very poor graphics"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good 1"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great work! Can perform FULL emergency last-minute editing of office documents on an 7"" screen @@"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"fantastic and well storage"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"By far, the best mobile document editor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It loads quickly (how often can you say that about Open Office?) and has some nice features to support use on a small screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The DRAW program sucks if you don't need it. It prevents any text work in the Office program and editing is nearly impossible. I've used Open Office on all my computers since forever, but this Android is definiately not the easiest app to use, if you have the DRAW program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oj"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"thank you. I'm using it on my note 10 plus"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oh heck yeah! $6 for an ad free full open source office suite was a no brainer. I vote with my dollars and I support open source every chance I get. Keep up the great work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I paid, and have the pro version. Yet the app keeps trying to phone home, connect to doubleclick, and google urls. I gave you 8 bucks! NO ADS NO PHONING HOME NO SPYING!! WHY?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I love that there's something that can open a lot of different file types and it's great to have these tools, but the interface of this is tiny and I find it difficult to navigate it properly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am really impressed. Android Open Office works just flawlessly on my phone and on my tablet and its files work seamelessly on my Windows Desktop. It works via Dropbox beautifully. I only use it for text so I can't speak for its other uses, but it is very good for basic text creation and editing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Getting windows full office into mobile is miracle .. great work !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am not fully capable yet on this app, but it is good enough for my limited needs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Input methods with Samsung note spen dont work it moves the page around but you cant draw with it or insert symbols theres no settings for it. Even if you use the stylus to write it won't put spaces in. Its unusable on a galaxy note."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Brilliant. Just what I need to share files between Android and Linux on Raspberry Pi"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I cannot find basic commands like remove keyboard, accept fill colour. I just clog up my tablet screen with mistakes I can't seem to remove. Ah well, back to the books I guess."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"For the last 6 hours has been trying to download an update?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"exporting to pdf with special characters reults in wrong spacing around those characters or event wrong case. im still testing. overall looks good edit: in desktop mode (Magic desktop) this look awful. half of the window is black"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fairrly Good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I updated to the ""professional"" version for 8 ‚Ç¨ and since then it only indicates loading error and something about BASIC and that is it. No invitation to update. Complete waste of 8 ‚Ç¨ !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I had more use using wordpad on my windows 95. May not have as many features but atleast it didn't delete my work one letter at a time as if i held back space (no keyboard plugged in.) Only to find that undo/redo is only finite got about 3 sentences back in 15 chunks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love open source. I love the fact that this suite is Microsquish compatible. I do wish the keyboard shortcuts were more intuitive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow! It helped in my notes at my Samsung tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ÿ¨ŸäÿØ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Carrage return doesnt work just double clicks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Seems to be a clone of Libre Office which, if so, is not saleable under the GPL.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very good BUT no odt file support direct from android files I have to load from within app and only states view mode only Please advise if I've got this wrong I'll give it 5 stars if so"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Does not work on my note pad at all its open up but than you can not do nothing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far the app does everything I need it to do. It is working well on a WalMart tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Some functions work better than the desktop version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't install on Samsung's a7 mobile. I tried for three times . Give solution"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am glad to be able to work with openoffice docs on android! Thanks a lot, Josef"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app, easy to write in and it has a lot of features."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OK, this is a third edit of my original review. I had some initial problems whch turned out to be operator error and I am happy now to give 5*. It's not perfect but as far as I am concerned it's the only app that lets me work easily with Open Office files on my Samsung tablet. So 5 it is."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used a version in my business on my computer. I was able to build multiple linked spreadsheets. It worked better than ms suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this is an excellent app I would recommend it for someone who wants to have office functionality with their mobile."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent. love ya'll.üíó‚ù§Ô∏èüíó"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"muy bueno y pr√°ctico para trabajar en mi tablet. uno A."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Horrible UI, it's totally desktop UI... And I got MESSY CODE from Chinese pptx"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good but using it is very difficult as the app doesn't fit in the screen. It should have a responsive design means it should resize itself according to screen size."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app was not bad for awhile and then suddenly it will not print anything without paying for an upgrade"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keep up the good work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very difficult used this ap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's very useful for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The spreadsheet is a full featured app that seems to do EVERYTHING that the Windows version of Open Office Calc does. It just plain works."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Useful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app. Works great with the documents created on the desktop version of the open office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent, though a little restrictive on screen display but I guess that's due to phone limitations"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is somewhat hard to use but great"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good üëçüëçbut large in size"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome for Android x86_64"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"THIS APP DOES REQUIRE A LEARNING CURB. ONCE YOU GET A HANG OF IT, IT'S FAILY SIMPLE TO USE. THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES :1. THE APP STARTED CRASHING A LOT AFTER I PURCHASED PRO VERSION. i HAVE LOST SOME WORK. 2. HAVING TO PRESS THE CHECK MARK ON THE SEARCH AREA SO YOU CAN CONTINUE WORKING AFTER YOU HAVE FOUND WHAT YOU SEARCHED FOR IS ANNOYING. WHAT'S MOST BOTHERSOME IS THE CRASHING AND FREEZING OF THE APP . I HAVE UNINSTALLED AND INSTALLED AGAIN BUT NO LUCK. PLEASE FIX THIS"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great product highly recommend it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The app interface reminds me of the word processing programs I had to use in school during the '90s. I can dig it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OMG This is such a lifesaver on the Chromebook. Easy to use, no nonsense, doesn't mess up the formatting of the XLS sheets, imported all the drop down menu info and everything. Absolutely Fantastic. Thank you so much for this!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Has all the features I need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Incredibly user unfriendly, cant even close the help menu without closing the app and losing document"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not Bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It does everything I need done!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really like this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I just love that mouse feature"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works like my office program. It's great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and powerful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great for what I need. I don't need all the bells and whistles that Excel provides and would never use. Simple to use for even an old guy like me!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very Intutive and Practical"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No control of navigator keeps butting in out of control?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As at laptop ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"OK for basic stuff like spreadsheets, but the Calc (database) is unusable to create or open exisiting openoffice files. Right click doesn't work at all....!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"From what i can see, it appears to be difficult or even impossible to see the screen as i type since the virtual keyboard will not move out of the way leaving me with one line of text visible and the keyboard taking up the rest of the screen. Is there a way to keep the keyboard onscreen but see what i'm typing as i type? Otherwise this program is less than useless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Dhruv cahuhan"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it's the only app have like"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used everything else, but wanted a real, desktop office experience, without the cost overhead and gimmicks of those other office programs. Androgen Office, is the overwhelming perfect choice for my new Samsung Galaxy Tab s6. The pro pack, is well worth the minuscule cost of the upgrade. Keep developing this thing. Keep making it even better. Thank You, for such a thorough product, at such a great price point."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great piece of software."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this is a great office suite hats off to developer who brought android (Chrome_Book)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time - works fine on my tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very simple and intuitive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"First try. I just converted a jpg file that was not rotated. It was a diagram. I did not expect it to convert it at all. There were some diagonal words that converted but not quite as well as the horixontal or vertical words. It left out the arrows which is understandable. I was amazed. Now i am going to put it into an affinity publication which i will have to copy and paste but doable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works ok but does not appear to allow saving in different formats. Also, it can be difficult to exit from some menus as there is no cancel/close menu button in that menu. Cut and paste, import of images is very complicated."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. All the features of a desktop app (great), but also the interface of a desktop app (not so great). Devs managed though to make it easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I am able to edit Libre Office files though it is a bit cumbersome without a full functional mouse. One point of annoyance is having to save updates using the ""Save As"" function vs. the ""Save"" function. If I use the latter I sometimes receive an error message."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app Thanks for creating this application It is a helpful application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Quite excellent. Im a basic user. Yet this app meets my needs perfectly. Used free for a month. Bought pro. P2XL"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Spell checker doesnt work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I find Open Office friendlier and easier to use than MS Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful for looking at documents on the phone. Also for minor updates to documents on the move. I am still using it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Better than memo."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent product"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice pro .. but we need more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow! Looks and acts like LibreOffice. Nice. Graphical optimization seems shaky, but performance-wise it seems fine. Will update if any issues arise."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The best share ware product I've used"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well even on a small mobile screen using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Should add scanner"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Recent work close when exit why?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good but lots of bugs!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Well featured."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Powerful program"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excelent app wich permits to use all kind of documents. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am a professional and use samsung tab 3 this is best app for office use I forget m-office Try it It is best app From Rajawat tech guru"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Horrible ....Advertiement gloare"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"There is no way to select text in order to copy & paste. I spent an entire day researching this on the Net. This is a PC app shrunk down for use on a large tablet. Useless for a cell phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very useful!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's pretty much unuseable with a tablet and keyboard - I love open office, but the text input and screen rendering are awful in this version - that I paid for!! The project has been around for a few years now and even though it has come on quite a lot an does have the ability to save to a NAS, with most other Android apps don't have, it's still far far behind where it should be!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office suite I've found for Android. Prefer it to MS Office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Please input database"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Frustrating to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't update. Keeps stopping the install."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the best office ever"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is practical"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Greedy psychopath somehow gains control of a product that was the epitome of human cooperation and turns it into an advertising machine that seeks to blackmail you into paying money for the psychopath to take the pain of wasting your life on adverts away. Plus it is impossible to adjust, crashes frequently and delights in being incompatible with everything else. Doesn't even deserve one star."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Work great on my phone when away from my desk"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An absolutely herculean effort to port OpenOffice to Android. I've only ever used Writer, but it has been extremely helpful to be able to use OpenOffice on my phone. There is one bug in Writer which should be fixed: when carriage return is tapped when the typing cursor is at the end of a line of text, the last word on that line is moved to the next line (instead of just moving the typing cursor to the next line)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have a Planet Computers Gemini PDA and needed a proper spreadsheet program for it. This provides just that and the files are compatible with my home computer Open Office program so I can copy them back and forth and update files whilst out and mobile AND I don't need any internet connection for it to work on the Gemini. There are a few bugs still, but overall it is good and better than any other offering on an Android OS (v7.1.1) based PDA. Only needed support once and that was good too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"your bengali font is very disgusting... i have sent you an email... please check out that...why there is no lang pack for bengali ??????"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great, the best of all Office app I have had."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"No template"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Compatible with desktop. Screen a bit busy for cellphone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far so good. It's why I put 5 *. But I'm still evaluating it, and didn't finish yet. So changes in rating may occur later on. Right now, I didn't find the command ""freeze"". Hope it's there, because it's very important for those like me who work on large sheets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I have trouble accessing files on my Chrome computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Great app! Just two bugs I saw so far... when I start writing, it always doesn't type the first letter. And the severe one: NO AUTOSAVE!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is much easier to use on a larger tablet screen than my samsung s10e phone on which the screen is so cluttered it's more or less unusable. But while trying to make an effort to give it a try on the tablet I found the ad screens just too intrusive forcing click to close. Waste of time. Likley the paid version is better but I can't make enough use out of this app to pay. Deleted them and still looking. Note! A settings request for usage data privacy was acknowledged by email from them."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best free word processing suite AND it's an open project with a number of free add ons."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its very use full for office workers"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent on the phone just like using a PC word processor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Please make androport blender and another open source 3d design"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for anything Microsoft office can do, but for free... I'm writing my own book on it now. Watch out soon for TheONE Savior's newest IMpossABLE ENDeavORS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app would be at least 4 stars if the copy and paste function was usable. If it is, then I certainly can't figure it out, and I have over 20 years of experience working with computers and programs. I have contacted the author of this program concerning this, and asking him if he would make this function more user-friendly. Hopefully he will understand me, and will respond with an update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Powerful and versatile. Kudos to the developer here. A wee-bit buggy (expected and tolerable) yet a job well done. ‚úåü§ì"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I will start with a 3 star rating because this app is available for android. * I have a question that will determine whether I use this app or uninstall it: * Is it possible to sync this app with the desktop version of Open Office so that if I create and edit that same document on either version? I will re-evaluate the rating once I get an answer to the above question. At that point I would even consider purchasing the Pro version of the android version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app works phenomenal. So far has all of the functions that open office has and it integrates well With documents and spreadsheets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Best app,Best design of functions, only it doesn't support most of font like Marathi and format"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice üåπüåπüåπüå∫üå∫üå∫üåªüåªüåªü•Äü•Äü•Ä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Buttons are cartoon looking and huge inside Dex, makes it almost uselsss, entire UI needs a makeover"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good start! I've been waiting for a proper port of OO or Libre for a long time! Thanks for providing this! Took me a while to figure out how to launch this in desktop mode.. . The ad's are annoying when closing and opening but thats something I can live with. Just needs some fine tuning and optimization improvements. On my Tab6 it lags a little when scrolling but overall good job!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good and its free"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very helpful and important app. It does everything properly. Due to this app. I can do my in computer. Use this app to know more about open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Frustrating to learn. Way harder to use than excel."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Lots of desktop features are not present at this moment. Also, selecting text is not a simple task. Odt - documents are not represented by AndrOpen Office icons. It needs to be corrected. The whole App should be redesigned. I give 3 stars for the tremendous effort."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"For someone that isn't office savvy it will drive you crazy. As I type this my friend is attempting to find a draft I tried to save could not figure out how. Then I tried to send it to my email but when I opened the email it is blank. I spend 2 hours that I can't get back now I have to recreate it. This was a draft of a presentation I'm giving."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is amazing: perfectly functional document edditing on smartphone. thank you for creating this."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SINCERELY, DR T P MASON PHD ESQ IV ATLANTA, GA. - 01/ 2020"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Quick operation which may be confusing to some. The GUI is not fit to screen in some ways. Also, no saving to .docx format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app for quick edits and data entry, spreadsheets are less functional because it is based on open office instead of the more functional libreoffice. But the Libre port is no where near as stable and functional as this app. All and all i wouldnt be without it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Easy use and too open"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good open source office suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"N o Hindi type, when I press space tab, it's making check box."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very good app Happy with it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its very nice app to typing any imformation"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I tried this on my S10+ phone and found it totally unusable. Much of the UI is designed for a mouse. The description says for Android. It should be more clear that it is only for large screens not phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for what it does: port a complex desktop suite onto a handheld format. Those that want a suite that feels native to the handheld world should look elsewhere."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"T·ªët"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works very well, not so fast as the laptop version, but anyway there everything works faster. BETTER for sure than Word, which did not save properly. And anyway has all the options while Word offers ridiculously few."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I lost HUGE text work, when I tried to share it without manually saving it. It seems there is no auto saving, which is very unusual for mobile devices :("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works like the PC version but can't get spell check working and even simple formula won't work. Update : I installed all free option packs and get most things working except chinese, I can get custom fonts on the cells (sheet) but the top input bar still showing blocks. I am a long time user of Open/Libreoffice on Linux, and the Android version works just like the full blown version on the PC, but considering tackling all the features on a tiny touch screen is a nightmare, even I've a 10"" tablet I still got headache doing it, I mean real headache ! Although I've keyboard mouse attached it still very trouble to work on the Android, the operation is quite different and limited on the mobile device, the read only problem on external drive is another headache to me, so that simply porting a successful app onto the device will not make it great ! I do not consider pay for it until it has improved to work as easy as other similar office suite, that I spent long time trying before I re-post this review."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is what it says on the tin. Which is good, because I have no intrest in cloud storage. However, it is a bit unstable so saving early and often is nessisary. Would have rated it higher if not for that."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is a bit slow on my tablet (mi pad 4plus) trying to do basic layout, instead of using a computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good quality free app, BUT you need to buy the professional app to work with cloud storage, so be warned! Cost is about 2/3 cups coffee."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"GREAT MOBILE APP. YOU CAN DO ANY TASK LIKE IN YOUR COMPUTER. A LITTLE MORE CUMBERSOME DO TO MOBILE SCREEN SIZE. MASTER WITH PRACTICE. I MOSTLY USE THE SPREADSHEET."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"After few days of use, I retract my old review. I would say it is different from others office app. Once get use to it, it is a nice app. Smooth and meet my expectation."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is the same as the Windows version. FREE FREE"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice one apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good Job Well Done. Seems to have all relevant options available in the software. EDIT Dec 2019 : After using the paid version for a few months there is one extremely annoying bug. The first character you enter into a spreadsheet cell is always deleted ie if you want to have Costs in a cell you have to enter CCosts Bill"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app tries super hard to look like a classic text editor from the 90's. So much in fact that it's just as clunky and dated as they used to be. Attempted to use with Samsung Dex and realized I could just be using Google docs for free - If this felt like a feature rich platform that was made for people of this decade it could be a real hit, but it really isn't - if cloud options or paid apps aren't an option, it works I guess, but you're going to be upset you can't use something else."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"awesome, just like libre open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have experimented with many Chromrbook word processors. Linux and subscription apps excluded, this app plus its bargain premium pack offer the best Android writing experience available. Android Open Offive belongs on every Chromebook used for more than emaii, browsing, and media consumption."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"A little complicated, but very nice, lots of features. Filled with ads and deceptive install popups unrelated to the language pack just installed, though. Uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ÿ≤Ÿàÿ±ÿØÿØ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Functional, but poor interface for a phone or tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Please help"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app. The HMI is still a little cumbersome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The app is like desktop app. Really nice concept. I feel it as future development of mobile app. Best of all app.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The demo seemed to work, so I bought it and now it's worthless. The spell check doesn't work, keeps scroling through every langeuage and won't stop. Now the text cannot easily be selected and it's too frustrating to use on my new-ish Android tablet. Update: I uninstalled the software and reinstalled it after ""upgrading"" to the professional version. The ability to move the curser is now OK, but no spellcheck??? Downloaded all additional apps, no spellcheck at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far the app has done everything I've needed it to do (text documents and spreadsheets). I'm able to save files locally on my chromebook which is awesome. I'll update if I come accross anything that doesn't work well, but this is a pretty sweet suite!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Bangla language add you application plz."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love Open Office and this app is a great addition for my mobile phone. I use a lot. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Does well with importing files. Would like to edit source list."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"HP 11 Chrome book and files on SD card. Unable to edit files. Saw a post from someone with a tablet (Android 4.4) and response to check settings. Unable to find Settings in either the app or Files app. Also, a check of the file on the SD card shows Read/Write permissions. I can open the file but can't save it on the SC card. AndrOpen Office shows great promise. As with any app there will be problems. Good to see you are addressing these as they arise."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent programme. Easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Kind of frustrating and buggy with the auto speller, but overall a handy and well made app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"üòÆ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Keeps creating unreadable files especially word documents. Other apps never read documents created by this app inspite of the fact that this app contains unique features but for itself not to be read or modified by other apps if the same category and job. Please do reply why and try to improve!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Extreamely satisfied !!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can't save anything on my phone. It just said something about a general error and then closed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Had an initial hiccup over getting write access to the SD card. I was unable to to follow the advice emailed by the developer because after beginning in the known right place I only got to step 2 before my screen diverged from the developer's screenshots. Nevertheless I got it working."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I used it to update an ods spreadsheet, worked fine . Update...I open a text file but just get a blank page. I can see the text in html and chrome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It does not do what I need to do on my android tablet. No mouse function, no modifying forms."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very explicit office just like all features available on your PC"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Terrible, clunky, buggy. Uninstalled"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its like we work using desktop.. very easy.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Poor keeps clearing my spreadsheet and goes back to the start Its really slow Very bad on a tablet if i had an alternative id use it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No issues at all but I only use it for simple spreadsheets and docs. Sure wish there were a comparable version for my iPad. More reason to switch to a galaxy :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"All that you need in one simple package."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good, but could scale pages to screen size, even a 10"" screen requires lots of scrolling to view documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app but more mb they have to put some 50 below"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Open office app, outdated version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome app have ever seen in my life."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I installed it on an Asus MeMo pad 7. I could open and edit all .doc and .docx files, but I could not save any changes. I get a general input/output error. Other than that, it works fine. This app works well on a Samsung Tab E. It opens and allows editing on all of the docs I tried. It aslso saves everything. I thing the Asus tablet was just no good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good on my phone, but a bit fiddly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"not english"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mostly stable and can do everything I want."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice apk"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app! Works great with my desktop office suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"If I download the file it doesn't download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏î‡∏π"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Lovely app for Android But hanging problem my phon"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app! It lets me do everything I need to with LibreOffice documents!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent productivity software. User interface could use some improvements, especially in Samsung Dex mode. Great app though. I use it all the time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very Good!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Nice loking app with potential but... Why is it so difficult to select a line of text to copy to the clipboard in this app? Can it be made easier please?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.... I was so worried about my work being submitted with errors due to conversion problems (google doc issues), but now this app has removed that issue.... Thank you developers. Excellent job!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"only need need to ""syncronize"" to complete my 5-starsüòä"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This works best if you have an external keyboard, as too much screen space is used by the keyboards that appear on the screen. Other than that, Iike it a lot!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great for me so far. Using my phone will have to try the desktop version soon."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office suit for phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unable to insert image without Google access"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Tested you app on video on youtube last year and disappointed. Nearly all the buttons had symbols, not text and the screen reader support was poor. This needs to improve to make this app accessible to everyone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good for letting me code my own stuff. Easy to personalize."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works very well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Your Bengali font is very weak. I cant write properly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"After using Open Office on my desktop computer, this comes very close. While Open Office is free, AndrOpen Office requires either a purchase or putting up with ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Seriously? The interface is like some miniaturized version of Windows XP made by a high school computer club. Really useless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great to have this Open Office suite on tablet and phone!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Thanks for this App. I have been using it for couple of yeras now. Its has only improved continually. Worthy alternate to MS Office and yes its free. Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful! Might as well be working on a desktop, albeit a very tiny one."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Does all I need!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like this app on my Android LG tablet, I really do, but there are a couple issues that I can't seem to solve. 1. I have a list that I want in two columns, but every time I do this, the columns go from right to left, instead of left to right (the text remains proper). 2. There seems to be no way to convert a document - all I get is a ""Resource File Missing"" error message. Anyone else have these issues? Or have a solution?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Acer R11 Chromebook!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"good for windows xp. not responding after inserting a photo (cant resize)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Disappointing software, the only feature I was using is gone: database. So I am moving away. Anyway the interface of this soft never evolve and seems more like an emulation of office. There are so many great office software adapted to androi, why bother."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good office suit. Although I think it can be improved."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"just hangs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfettamente compatibile con i documenti OpenOffice, mi permette di leggerli e modificarli ovunque io sia."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Difficult to use. Icons hard to interpret"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It just doesn't work. It crashes if I try to change the zoom level. If you try to save anything you get an uncomprehensible error message. Completely useless. Look elsewhere if you actually want to get anything done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This Office app is the best among the all others."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't even long press select text."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I used to be able to password protect documents using this app. I cant anymore. I set a password using the protect function and but then it just opens the document without asking for the password. Anybody know how to fix this? Would give 5 stars before it did this."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Osum"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent app, but screen size is a limitation."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love having a single app to use on all the assorted devices that I have around the house, as the devices multiply I can use the same the same app on all, it's kind of wonderful that way."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sir please add hindi in the font apps please please"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you for your product! üòäüëç"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Danneggia i file"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"best office app hands down, able to work with all formats."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very useful for me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have just discovered that the cruelly missing combination ALT+Enter can be done with CTR+Enter available on the in app keyboard extension. GREAT! I will check the IOS version ASAP to see if it is the same. By the way, why not add a shortcut button for this combination in the primary keyboard? Thanks for the job done!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Best but needs to understand"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"thanks for the first app for document"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very flexible and powerful for a handheld device. Very compatible to PC formats."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So cool! You can write PDF without PC.It is awesome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A very nice substitute of Office available on android.... and thanks for permitting custom fonts."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I picked up my iPad to use and discovered I have an update for an App I did not install. Beware of this app, no app should be able to automatically install without prompts for permission, even if the device hasn't bee used often. Immediately removed for this reason."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent work, makes my tablet a boatload more useful, to the point where I now do 99% of the writing on it. Nearly all the power usually found on the laptop. TY to all who built this."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"At times it opens a word document which is out of the view (only partly visible)... and is not adjustable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used open office for years and love it, love this version for my Phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best Office suit for Mobile Devices"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Error when saving spreedsheet - waste really"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's ok but it has issues like it does not allow you to edit and save files in an SD card, the opening screen is very poorly designed, icons look a little like chidren drawings... If you could improve the design and, more important, allow editing files in external flash drives, it could probably be the best in the market. But also, thanks a lot!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works very well and as advertised. Very similar to Microsoft Office and reads and stores in the same format if desired. I would recommend this to a friend or anyone else."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I used to be writer module only to open word doc files created by open Office on a desktop but are there apps could not open, even though they are supposed to. Easy to use if you are already on open Office user on a desktop. Nicely done thank you. Requires a Wi-Fi connection to work, probably because of the ads. I did not find the as intrusive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A great (and free) alternative to Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Does what I need to do very well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I LOVE THIE APP.IT HELPED ME IN MY P.E. POWER POINT PROJECT.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does every thing I am wanting"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good ,user friendly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Although I've had a few problems using this program on my tablet, I'm a big fan of Open Office. It's the only program I use for my writing. One book down, two to go. I have recommended the program to people who ask me what program to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"keep improving keep updating"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It was great but now I can't open anything in google drive on my new Samsung Galaxy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on my Android tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Takes way too long to download and some times it is a pain to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A great app replicating Open Office on a tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Generally good on the tablet but quirky. Sometimes freezes or crashes. Some features in the document editor either don't work or are non-intuitive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great on my tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Maybe OO is like French Wine: Getting better with age. In any case, its now a lot more usable on Android than it used to be. *** *** *** Wanted to like it, but this GUI is an f'ing catastrophe. Sub-windows open which are impossible to close, covering most if not all of the app's menu bar in the process :-("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Handy little app. I'm a writer. This works on my phone and tablet both, so I can do bits on my phone in odd places like waiting-rooms, and when I get home continue working the piece on my tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Piece of garbage. Will not allow edit as advertised. Uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Dest office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The best version of Openoffice for Android that I have found!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works well between my G3 and desktop through my Google drive. I use a Bluetooth keyboard with my G3 in full screen while listening to music. Its very stable. Full screen to Adobe reader and back to full screen. It is pretty much identical to desktop version for the writer, not much work with other functions. I still use this app on my now 3 year old V20, and it is still seamless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great works"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Un-installed it within five minutes... can't edit formulas. It kept insisting on replacing my semi-colon with a comma, so oddly enough, the formula didn't work! Not ready for prime time. Plus, the actual area of spreadsheet displayed is about a third of the screen; the rest is taken up by non-removable toolbars. Might be usable on a larger screen (if the above mentioned issue is resolved), but it's useless on my five-inch screen. Hope it gets straightened out, as it would be nice to be able to have my sheet immediately available (made in Open Office.) Too bad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Best app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Paid for upgrade to Pro to get rid of Ads but they came back after the app auto updated. No help from developer, who blamed Google."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really this is great app..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does the job well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A bit laggy, but I put that down to the whole Android Tablet superama experience. (Maybe less Power Saving will speed it up?) Otherwise a fine affordable and bloat-free office package at a fine price. Clunky yes, but which Sun-branched Libre/Open fork isn't?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This really is not worth the effort. I am trying to write a spreadsheet but just about everytime I try and copy a formula from one cell to another it warns me about overwriting data even though the recipient cell is empty. It keeps warning me even though I click yes or no to acknowledge, the only way to continue is to close AndrOpen Office and loose everything that had been inserted since the last save. OpenOffice should be ashamed to be associated with this offering"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"No help available under the heading of help. No fonts available in fontwork. You have to download the language pack which is not explained to enable those features."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Seems to be ok, except if you are interested in upgradeing the explanation is you will get ""other usefull functions"". REALLY? I just cant wait to spend $6 to see what is in that unmarked box under the Christmas tree!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've switched very recently, bought the pro version and downloaded the extensions. I have to say it is very good indeed. It seems to have everything that the pc version has as far as I can see. How have I not seen this before?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A good set of office software that doesn't change everything with each release."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÜ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I find this app quite useful for my use. This is a good application of the Open Office code. I recommend this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"How can you go wrong! Pick this free program up and use a fully functioning office suite for.....free!!! It's excellent, easy to use and really user friendly. This program is also identical to the free open office suite in almost every way. It's intuitive and simple. The developer is smart, friendly and answers questions almost immediately. love, love, love!!! Developer is super and fixes things almost instantly. Best word processor out there!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good, basic doc suite. I got this because the Libre Office options don't work. My only complaint is that it often closes itself when in the background for even a few minutes but it may be a setting on my tablet. I use this app often."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Update 24/9/19 does work well when it works properly, I reduced the stars thanks to it now including the API I will not be updating this app, will hope my new rating will reurn this to its former way. In the meantime I have uninstalled it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does everything I need it to do, very happy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works with DropBox."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool.... ‚úçÔ∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As a Linux and Libre office user it's nice to have an app that can work with odt format. Save me the hassle of having to convert my files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It worked ok for me until yesterday, now I can't download from the cloud without upgrading to the pay version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it makes it so I can use all my open office docs from my computer on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow.nice...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Runs well on my ancient tablet; stable. Very similar to the desktop version. Much easier to work with than the android port of GIMP. If you don't want to use Google's suite, this is a great alternative."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I was thrilled to find this version of OpenOffice for Android. It makes me a lot more productive in this on-the-go world."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect! ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"no language support for malayalam"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It meets all my requirements including dictation through g board voice typing, for which I am using it extensively."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Difficult to handle ... . After some changes it will be awesome ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Love this App, have been using it for years. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is some of the slightly more advanced features I struggle with (macros and forms). Not sure if the problem is me, my tablet or the application. Regardless I highly recommend this app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent free replacement for MS Office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Can't read pdfs Duh!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works well just a bit awkward on phone, using bluetooth keyboard I`ve had o problems with it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"i dont like the free version. it spoiled my whole day. i typed a document for quite a while then suddenly advertise then document gone. i typed it again in afternoon same thing i could not find any of the document i used on laptop but it doesnt autosave or recover anything. i lost the laptop and have to use android tablet. it is ridiculous this app discards two hours of work to show advert for product i never buy in my life. it is not free app. it can not be used to write document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally a decent office app that doesn't cost a fortune or litter your experience with constant advertising."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Wasted my mb for a cumbersome app. Uninstalling now."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely filled with ads, incredibly slow, and simply not worth it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"didn't work for me, save files couldn't be opened or read. Not have time to get it working, UNINSTALLED"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. it has the same options from MS word on PC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice. Only adds are hardly avoidable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"dont like adds!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good app for spreadsheet work and Docs; I liked OpenOffice on a pc and this is nearly the same. Use this for offline work. Sometimes the menu in Docs writer seems a bit out of focus."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it is one of the few apps that actually works, good compatibility to open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Sub-par. Works, but not well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Frustrating in drawing page when importing picture from gallery and trying to edit it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Work disappears then it refused to load, repeatedly stopping. Uninstalled reinstalled and it kept stopping. I uninstalled it for the last time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app just a little bit troublesome to use on my phone but does virtually everything I need. Nice work developers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent...use just the spreadsheet, though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"quite useful so far and it seems to handle everything i use a word processor for. so all good so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"My choice for spreadsheet and document editor for 10 years."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Interesting port. But why the ads? The app was developed with entirely free software right? Apart from the one time Google developers fee of course."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"wow!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ∞"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Paid version is more stable than free. Free version corrupts the file while you work on each time an ad is displayed. Be warned. Otherwise, brilliant, use it every day. There is a bug with printing a range of pages to a .pdf instead of all pages. You choose a range, it still prints all pages to .pdf."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a good App to work with, There are a lot of times it has issues of not wanting to respond."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Add-on to my past review: Now I have some experience in using this app. It is a good effort with lot of functionality but seems to be unstable and gives some unpredictable behavior. Luckily my data was not lost but I am uninstalling it because of its unstable behavior. Downloaded it only today so I don't have much experience in it but failed to open pdf documents despite installing pdf pack. What is the experience of others?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is good but in this app is not make database table.so fix this problem."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very Goood Appsüëçüòêüëè"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best of the best to run any business from any android OS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Used to work great but at some point stopped working at all. Can't open any type of file. Just hangs at the loading screen. Present over the last several updates. Tried wiping storage and data of app and uninstalling and reinstalling. Hopefully it will work again one day as it used to be a 5 star app. Edit - started working normally a while backed. Upped from 1 to 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Dont like this app. This app keeps auto correcting and ithis keeps messing me up when typing. cant turn this feature off"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I had reset my settings also but still the hindi letters are appeared in boxes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I can't write common fraction.How can I write common fraction? Please, solve it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you. Such a full and thoughtful release. Lifesaver."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is a piece of garbage. It couldn't open a spreadsheet to save it's life. It worked once and never worked again. Uninstall starts right after this review..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"good in writing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"App WrkT GrayT!!! I SimpLy Didn'T Yuuz IT Very OfT And IT DeffinniTLee Yuuzd Thuh MosT Space, So Thiss Tym I Need Space Thiss Ap Iz GeTTing UninsTahLd."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Hopefully the developer will read this because I am not sure how to report a bug with this app.  I was looking for a writing program for my Lenovo e10 tablet.  I'm a writer and was looking for the best way to continue my writing away from the house.  Take out my microSD card from my computer, pop it into the tablet, and continue typing away while out to eat or the like.  I got this app because it opens and saves in .odt, which is great and does that just fine.  Save for one bug:  After the app is open for about fifteen minutes or so the cursor stops updating my typing.  The cursor doesn't blink and doesn't update on the screen until I use the arrow keys on the Bluetooth keyboard to move it and only then will it update what I've typed.  I'm using a Bluetooth keyboard and android 8.1.  I don't know why this is happening, but until that is fixed I can't use it.  Once that is fixed then I'll use it exclusively."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"So this is basically the desktop version, but on a mobile device. The nice thing about that is all of the features are there, nothing is missing. But the downside is that this is not optimized for the mobile format. Getting to the specific seeing you want (like even increasing font size) is more tedious than it should be. If you have a large tablet and a stylus, this may be for you. On a phone, this is just no good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Just installed 14 percent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not write in hindi language"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I could not even get though writing one document and the entire thing went buggy on me - my page and a half randomly became 96 pages , all with with the same sentense copied to each separate page. what a mess"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good aap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"vry nice app thank u developer ji"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"this app is a garbage it is not capable to do slide show and mouse is also not working properly It is my humble request to this app's developers to improve its functioning"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Splendid app! Ways better than any office app on android encountered. Sure thing though as it is the LibreOffice, powerful Microsoft Word alternative, porting. Highly recommend. For your language, be sure to select a related font or else character display error will occur."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"there needs to be a paid version. I cant stand having so much of my phone screen occupied by ads. I'd be happy to pay a few bucks to get rid of them but this version with the ads is intolerable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"good but this app did not have Font option for Sri Lanka, please do the add above this app there matter"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"full nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Workable pivot table solution is availabe here but not so easy without mouse support. Dragging behavior is hard to achieve. Indic fonts do not get saved."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"lovely"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Adverts sit right where you select options. A slightly offset finger opens an ad. Slimy!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It does PARTIALLY do the job. But you have to put up with a Lot of Ads, and every time I went to make an Excel document, I have to download more fonts. This App is WAY To Huge!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"When I started using open office in my pc , I found it some similar than Microsoft office.But when I saw this Andropen office ,I was excited to see it . And this was the similar to the open office that I used in my pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"by it all mathematics can be written. also featured full like computers"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"somewhat volatile, when inserting in mid word to fix a spelling mistake, it inserts a random word from the current sentence in the middle of the word. Then the undo operation does not take it away. So I give up, and decide to leave file open on my phone. Then start over when i get home on laptop using the phone as reference. When selecting the open app it must have timed out and brings me to the main menu. No auto save, nothing in recent docs so I lost all my changes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Outstanding, but it is old version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"not useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"genuine app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I've tried several times to install this app on my android phone but to no avail. can someone help me to know why?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I couldn't write anything in the text window... may be it had some secret I didn't know"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"who"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Runs so many ads that it's impossible to type a single word. Can't get anything done with ads popping up the moment you open it. Then, when the ad finishes, application crashes. Looks like it could have cool features, but basically, sucks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"not compatible with android pie"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Came here to update my 3-star review only to find that it mysteriously disappeared.. just like everything in the spreadsheet I worked on all day. Opened the file and only had one row (and two additional but empty sheets). Folks this app is terribly broken. Don't waste your time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It couldn't even open existing spreadsheets..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it! I recently bought a cheap usb c hub to try Dex on my S8+. With this app, Dex, and a wireless keyboard / mouse, I feel like I'm working working on my PC. Many thanks for providing this useful app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"very good application for everyday use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i like this app with mouse.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I downloaded OpenOffice for Microsoft Windows 7. I came to like the program; very much. And I thought that I should have it in my Galaxy Note 8 smartphone. So I downloaded it. I wish I could say that the Smartphone version of OpenOffice, was just as good as the PC version, I have on my laptop. Alas, I haven't even been able to USE AndrOpenOffice. I open the program; and that's as far as I get with it! The program doesn't do ANYTHING. Absolutely NOTHING appears on the page."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"best app for this function.Do not other download thi app.üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"this app is barely functional for a phone. maybe for a tablet or COMPUTER it would be useful. i finally uninstalled after much dissapointment."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"best app in the Android world. but please add lite version because every time mobile has been hanged"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Need some improvements...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"if all"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"After installing AndrOpen Office and trying to use it, I found out that it doesn't work with online storage (like dropbox, etc.) and since I work on a Chromebook (with limited storage) I can't use this. If you had been more upfront about that in the beginning I might have considered giving you the money. But (so far as I can tell from your advertisement) you waited until I had installed it and tried to use it to let me know. That is deceitful and unethical and I'm going to uninstall it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"To the point, this is great! I started using OpenOffice many years ago but was skeptical of AndrOpen Office when I saw it. I have found it to be great to use on my phone and tablet. It's better on the tablet with a bluetooth keyboard for obvious reasons. I still use an old (v9.x) version of WPS office sometimes but find this app better since it's just the same going from PC to Android and back. Thanks to the author for so much hard work and a great job!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Almost 2020, Fantastic with Google Play According every Law also regulations !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sieht sehr gut aus, sehr m√§chig. St√ºrzte √∂fters ab, aber nach einer Neuinstallation scheint es jetzt zu gehen. Kann odt editieren."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"tolong perbaiki bug..kursor tidak dapat di geser kanan kiri"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Totaly useless! What the heck? App doesn't save changes to the document. What a waste of time!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"great app, best suit Ive found, whish it had multi-Language support"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"can't even cope with pdf files. what a joke"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office This is by far the BEST package of office apps there is. and its FREE!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"please can you include gujarati language."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I was considering buying this until the FREE version ERASED MY WHOLE file. Something in the FILE DROPDOWN was touched by accident and with no warning 2 hours of my work dissappeared. Also I was unable to remove a formatting window that popped up. Also WHY doesn't this thing automatically scroll so I CAN SEE what I'm typing using a virtual keyboard? The virtual keyboard covers the text that I'm editing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A fantastic App and Free too !!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nicely apps, recommended for bussiness used"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This was once a usable app. It had a lot of weird bugs but it gave you a chance to do some work on a phone. Unfortunately the developer decided to force adchoices ads on us and the implementation is so horrible they disable the app if those ads cannot communicate. All the reviews complaining about getting stuck on a loading screen are probably because those ads couldn't be displayed. I wish the author had just charged for the app instead of this bonehead move."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent value and quality."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Seems a good app and a way to move away from Microsoft"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app ever !!! Been using on PC and works awesome here as well.. better then MS office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice need i spect less6 look mom a tape awe go to your room look mom 58 bill in national security ai awe go to your room go hide under your desk"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent port works fine on Oreo 9.1"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent, once i changed the macro security setting on aoo, i was able to do everything i wanted to do. i would not develop spread sheets on this teeny tiny phone, but i can easily make daily entries. well done!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best office suit for android so far with complete tools. recomended for 10.1 screens and above."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I so like this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I even did not like Microsoft Office after I had installed this one for the first time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Disappointed, Database wont let me create,edit or do anything to tables, i thought it was just my tab but its exactly the same on my phone. that was why i was so happy to find this app, i could create and edit database when not at my pc. i was so wrong."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"its not opening my doc and docx files.it just gets stuck on loading screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Its alright, but i can't use tue pdf export. it crashes when i try"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"gooD"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Trying to find a good spreadsheet app, and this is not it. This feels like I'm trying to run a 1990s version of Excel on a remote computer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"ads are not a problem. the problem is full screen ads. they never used to be like this. whats up?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Could be great but EXTREMELY buggy. Had to stop using because the calc editor kept glitching out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This looks like the desktop version of libreOffice was somehow stuffed in an android app using some kind of compatibility layer.  That's a good thing, because this app has the most powerful document rendering and conversion engines of any app on the play store.  The only negative thing I have to say is the user interface is hard to use on mobile touch-screens, but its definitely usable. I think this app would work even better on tablets and ChromeOS devices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"very bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For people who use this on their phones (like I do): Don't struggle with space. Like all good office suites, Andropen Office's interface is customizable. Get rid of all the button toolbars and use the menu bar alone (files - edit - view - etc at the top). Along with the virtual mouse and the three lines button in top right corner (finger friendly menu bar), it'll give you access to everything you need, and you'll have so much more space on your screen for working."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't even open a simple text file."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"doesn't open in Android 6.0"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"please make a update"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Pls it not opening on my device. It hangs middle way"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"ngoogle drive access - why is it on android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best free office app ever! Even converts!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent package"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Add a complete keyboard with all the function keys and shortcut keys because we find it difficult to perform some operations please."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"love this app BUT ! i cant upgrade it. its saying not available in your country but the basic version is available in the app store in my country ????"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"ripoff"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Jitni tarif ki jaye kam hai , App thode jyada MB KA HAI , BUT ALFEATURE SAME WORKS AS LIKE IN PC.. BEST APP HAI EXCEL, WORD OR POWERPONT SIKHNE KE LIYE."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This is the only app available to work on open office documents in Android and I am very grateful for it. Unfortunately it is also the most annoying app, I ever worked with and it has many bugs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Horizontal screen orientation is bugged: shows a spell check window almost every second. Not usable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Mere phone ye download nhi ho raha"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is one of the most complete office suites available in the mobile world. Most stop at text-spreadsheet-presentation, but AOO continues with drawing (SVG), graphics import, math formating, and even a flat database. It fully supports ODF and MS formats along with a wide range of others virtually unsupported by any other office suite, and it has the elite feature of supporting password protected documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"giving it a try again thanks so much"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"jb il"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"best app guys ever..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is hard to know how effective this program can be because there is no working help facility. One feature that would not work is obtaining coloured text. Setting black text against a coloured background was possible. The touch screen interface is very cluttered and a single misplaced touch can destroy your work. If you struggle with this tool it is a good policy to back up your work frequently. There was a tendency for menus to hang around after they had been used, closing erratically."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Can't fill in Documents Deleting the app not what I need Open long enough to find I can't fill in Documents Work Great on my Laptop just not on Android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"neat"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"400 plus MB of space just for this? And then some more for Add-ons? No thank you. I'd rather use my PC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"it serves the right purpose. It is the best app so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best app... I was seeking for since many years at last got this one... I'm very very thankful.... thanks devs .... highly recommended"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ooh la laa this app helps me alot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great App. It finally solved my problem. I could format my document size to 6"" √ó9"" on my android phone. Thanks for your great work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"open office for PCs great I like it and use it. but ,this andropen office is not good at all. my advice take a pass on this one there are other office apps out there that will work better on Android phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"if didn't ask for purchase later on, then it's gteat"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"nice app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"on my Chromebook they do open now. if I download the same app on my phone I can't create a document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it's so nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"most excellent!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I had to stop using it when it went into a loop at print time. Before I could even select a printer, it went right back to the file manager screen and I had to start the print process all over again. After at least a dozen attempts doing the sequence differently, I finally gave up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I just purchased it today. It's a great app if it's working properly. Please fix it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great 5 star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"No marathi or hindi language support. Menus cover most of the screen area. Therefore we can see very less data."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Will not access files on Google Drive. It will access google drive on my Galaxy S8.. But not on my chromebook.. Shame as this is a good program.. Added later date: It always saves a corupt file, so never save back to the original file or you loose everything. Not worth downloading.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this app is good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Doesnt automatically save"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"You broke it again with recent update can't using text at all have 2 floating blue dots on document that's it. I am frustrated with louisy program.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"its a sort of useable version of open office. Its a shame, its so close to being a useful app but it needs an autosave function. Sometimes you can switch back and forth between apps and resume your project. Other times switching back and forth will restart your current project, forcing you to start over. Not to mention every time you try to correct a word the program tries to fill in random words. Conclusion? This is an app thatll just get you by when you cant use a full version of office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Didn't get to do much b4 it crashed. But scrolling was very slow on Samsung s8. pasted a diagram in the middle of my table of contents? go to undo, to find as I didn't accidentally paste it, no undo. scratch my head, scroll a bit more and it froze. force close. uninstall. hope u can fix it. found apps 'mobile view' and liked it. b4 it pasted the diagram and crashed. didn't corrupt my doc but."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Not without glitches, but still an excellent app. It does what few other apps do. It functions as a true desktop software. it cannot be compared to any other app. I am using other editors, especially Polaris, but I consider that I cannot fully address my editing interests without this app. It does not function perfectly, but it's still a powerful software. I hope that they keep working on perfecting this one ... the only Open Office software that edits."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"ridden with ads. unusable for an office tool. gives the impression of being something non serious/morally shady since they need to scrape users with ads for money. you really should stop associating ""open""with these kind of ad intrussive predatory software"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"its ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Andropen on Chromebook HP x2 I commend the developers for the challenge of porting this major office suite to Android. Some people are writing bad reviews instead of taking a little time to read and learn the features of this great app. The only issues I have experienced are an occassioanl freeze, or Andropen disappearing when clicking ""Open"" from the initial screen. Because it doesn't happen very often, it could possibly be an issue with Android on ChromeOS. Keep refining this great app!"

Otherwise, I have been waiting for someone to port Libre Office or Open Office to Android for YEARS! I cannot thank you enough. Is printing from the app supported? If so how do I configure that?"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Edit: after further using this, I'm upgrading my review to 5 stars. As far 
as I can tell, it's a great port with all the features. Originally, I just 
needed something that would let me view and make simple edits to a .ods 
spreadsheet on my smartphone. This seems to work very well for that. It 
also works great on a tablet with Bluetooth keyboard, only it's hard to 
select text sometimes; often the screen scrolls instead. The viewable area 
can be zoomed in/out by pinching with two fingers. It starts up with a 
virtual keyboard taking up half the screen, though - just press ""back"" to 
minimize it."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works great for me, simple menu interface, works seamlessly with Libre Office documents. Easy to turn on/off onscreen keyboard for full document viewing. Enlarge or shrink documents for viewing.  Working on Samsung 10.1 tablet.  Even better with bluetooth keyboard.   Very intuitive, tried all the other office Apps, but not a patch on this.  Only small hiccup is files must be opened from within AndrOpen rather than touch a file in a folder.  I haven't found how to link file types with AndrOpen."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I agree with Richard. Has the same cluttered User Interface (UI) as the 
desktop version. That is pretty awful on a PC screen, but at least you can 
find the document in the mess! Take a look at Textmaker, which is based on 
the same Sun Microsystems code base. Unfortunately Textmaker doesn't run on 
my patched Nexus 5x."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"EDIT: Recently bugged by go-slows, freezes and saves not saving. One way or another, I lose the results of my effort. ________ ORIG: Quite good. The interface is a complete rendering of the desktop Open Office (as far as I know), which means familiar features are in a familiar place. However, that makes it fiddly to use on a touch-screen tablet. There seems to be a problem with the Borders and Fill menus not disappearing when not in use. It's a pity there is no facility for the Datedif function.  One query: How to select a range of cells on a touch-screen? For example, I want to paste a formula into cells S5 to S98, how do I select the destination cells?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The worst app I have used.  A complete waste of time to use.  Find something else that actually works properly.  This app gives the Open Office project a very bad name.  The only good thing is that the app is not by the Open Office people, so don't think this is how Open Office works on a desktop or laptop.  When creating a document, the app kept closing the document, forcing me to re-open it.  Of course, no changes had been saved.  This happened multiple times.  It took 2 and 1/2 hours to write 30 lines.  Then when opening the document the next day, the same things above still happened.  However, since I started to save the document after writing every word, the app stopped responding.  I had to turn off and restart the phone in order to open the app again.  I doubt I will be using this app again."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A tremendous effort, but it has a lot of bugs. When using the mouse, the menu select buttons don't work, but needs some curser cajoling to get the blue hover button to show. When not using the mouse, you can't select any text blocks, only one word. The proportions of the imported text don't fit the original Apache Open Office files, so text is bigger, making about 20% more pages. The file saving leaves the lock file unerased after the app is closed, like it's useless, because the file can still be edited."

The January update basically rendered the spreadsheet unusable, unable to ""Save As,"" ""Insert Picture from File,"" ""Insert Sheet from File"" or anything which required switching to the file explorer. I've struggled with the useless MobiSystems offering for two months and tried OpenAndroid again. Still unusable, except that I found that accessing the Settings wheel on the app load up page and selecting ""PC Mode"" made everything alright again.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Sadly this app, the paid version, is determined to connect to an ad server! The use of one of the three standard adaway hosts files effectively cripples the app. A bit sad when you pay money and the dev still wants to grab more by connecting to an ad network. Otherwise the app is good, so if you don't care about some dodgy connection under the covers probably it is OK. Otherwise dev should be honest or stop the money grabbing. Sadly even after disabling the google tracking this app still won't work reliably (at the moment that means not at all) with ads blocked.  I noticed you ported libreoffice and that seems to work OK with ads blocked, the two level invocation (under android ports) is not so pretty and for sure it is more suited to use when I have my mouse and keyboard attached but at least it is not intent on getting to the ad servers. As an aside, it is also impossible to install OpenOffice language packs with ad blocking enabled (the installer, which has just been downloaded from the network, thinks there is no network connection). Maybe it is not directly your use of ad servers but something in google play services but for sure this app needs ad access."

Good application and nice job. Hope the particular resolved soon.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best word processor for Android, hands down, exceptionally, detail oriented, I think we all as developers and innovators have a lot to learn from this app.  Password protected documents is awesome, great for Journaling classified data, however, can get glitchy, I get that,  this is a whole new level fundamentally in application development.  I think it was Bill Gates that said ""you'll never need more than 640k (b). Completely out does Microsoft Word, and laughs about it.  Microsoft Office for Android is but a mere viewer with little options for on-the-fly editing.   The benefit of Open Office is its local,  for the most part depending on the advancement of network deployment.   However,  there are security flaws,  in the system,  but the device pretty much has to be bugged because it even works in Airplane mode,  excellent for business people, engineering,  mathematics.   Excellent work to the developers,  by far the best thing on the market right now.  Even surpasses Adobe I feel.  And there are scaffold versions for professionals.  Thank you Apache,  you are a true innovation leader,  and I will stand behind advanced application deployment with the utmost respect and care.   Take Care,"

I guess Google sheet users are simple, and don't really use spreadsheets.  Hats off to the developers."

The problem is, the program keeps redoing deletions as soon as I scroll away! A kluge that works sometimes is to type two spaces after every revision. The program seems okay for shorter documents, but I again recommend editing in ""full screen"" mode. You get it by pressing Ctrl-Shift-J. It hides all of the menus and tool bars. To get them back, you tap a button in the upper left corner of the screen. The program works best with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard. Otherwise the onscreen keyboard adds too much clutter -- especially to a smartphone screen. Something that's also never gone away are floating menus that don't really float, and take up valuable screen real estate, even though they are so narrow that you have to use a scroll bar to see the contents. It's very frustrating with stored bookmarks."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The amount of ads this app spawned made my phone just about unusable. The app itself is fine but the ads are non stop, even over the top of other apps when using them. Got so fed up dismissing ads when reading email or browsing etc it just wasn't worth the agro of keeping it installed. Its now gone and so have the ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"hmm its great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Simple to use in one sense but hard in other ways. This app won't allow you to change languages as the buttons are to small to use. Clearly its not worth the ¬£5 there asking for the pro version and sadly you can't recover money back from very poor apps by knowing what it's like on the free version due to certain items being locked out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You Can Write Documents Here"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Utterly flawed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is functional and the latest version seems to have fixed the bugs that made it too unstable to use on my tablet. But why is this using the desktop interface? What's needed is functional equivalence, not a hard to use clone. As it is, this app is a pain in the ass to use, but it's the only thing that won't screw up the formatting of my odt documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I don't have opened on OPPO F1S. Its not running. Please fix it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I wanted a simple office suite for my phone which could use files from the Open Office suite I use on my laptop. This fit the bill and even saves files in the same odt or ods format. The ability to save files in PDF format is a bonus."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Still to use it. Can't comment yet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It seems like open office for pc but without all the fonts! Why doesn't it have all the fonts I am used to having!!? However, great app. I do recommend it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It a great concept, but just not ready for prime time. It is clear, that this is an emulator, but reduce the lag, and polish the software, this will be the best free software for Chromebooks"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"good office app just takes getting used to the way it functions"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Looks nice and easy to use, but of no use as you can't save anything. Fix this bug and it'll be spot on"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I don't know about the app very much but it looks attractive. It may or may not be useful. üòä"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a wonderful app for my android Tecno Tablet. it really matches.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Waste"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love the ability to use OpenOffice on my tablet. 5 stars if I could only save files to my Dropbox. I can only save to local files. Samsung SM-T913."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This program didn't save data. Every time the screen lock comes on, it erase all data"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use PC mode most of the time on Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, and I'm happy and have fun with it, but not so on my Samsung S8+.   Specially when it comes to DeX environment, the AndrOpen Office PC mode does not look good, the interface remain small in size and cannot enlarge or resize.  AndrOpen is the only complete office suite at the moment that offering database, therefore please kindly consider to supporting DeX mode and give us maximum and resizable interface pleasure."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The control is too hard to use. I'd prefer the built-in office app than this. Uninstalled the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Waste app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is really cool done it gives me the full open Office software on my phone. Everything I've needed seems to work although it isn't always happy being minimised for too long. Using it on a phone can be fiddly because of the screen size but that can be adjusted with zoom settings and using Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. It has ads but I've only seen them when closing individual office apps so they aren't intrusive at all."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Seriously, this is an amazing app. Truly a work of art. Microsuck can well, bug off. I will be supporting this developer by purchasing the pro key. What is a few dollars compared to what Microsuck wants from us? Great job Dev! Keep it up."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ad pop ups take over and make you lose your work,bad app forget you saw it."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It is very usefullapp"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app simply works where others haven't. I only use it on my Samsung Note 4 to open and read  documents created with Open Office and it does that fine."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OpenOffice is one of the best programs out there and it's free! I love all the work you guys put into this and I'm so excited for this app! It hass worked perfectly -except I was getting a little frustrated that it wouldn't let me properly view PDFs, untill found the add-on section. If you're downloading this app make sure you go to the add-ons and add the PDF Imports. Then you'll have everything you need. There are other useful add-on such as extra fonts that you may want too.. Thanks again OpenOffice!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I'm happy this is available, but I'm not finding it to run reliably enough to trust for my big manuscript.  AndrOffice frequently crashes and I'm just not getting a warm fuzzy feeling about putting this manuscript I've been working on for five years, 100,000 words long through it.    It's useful for taking notes at meetings.  Really happy to have that,   Also, I have to say I have no way of knowing how much of the problem is related to the tablet I have (off-brand) or tablets in general."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hi developer, how can I write in Hindi language... Plz guide me...."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Thanks for your great work and adding Indian languages ... Some more things...  1) Sometimes many crashes are there during making any new documents ... So plz resolve it ...   I want to suggest 2 more thing to make this app more useful ...    2) Can you please develope ""language specific Character recognition"" through mobile camera within this app like in ""office suite""?  One app "" Text fairy "" is there in play store which can recognise jpg, jpeg and pdf and some other formates also and convert that to various types of word documents and vice versa but that needs many upgradations like user specific or user preferably column , chart and table etc recognitions before conversion of various pic formates and pdf to word documents...   3) Please provide easy user guide within app  Thanks 4)  If possible make it light weight"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"To port something like this on android and have it working is amazing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Looking for alternative. Opening doc from Google drive, all this app opens is itself & ads. Requiring download of doc, defeating purpose of cloud, or renavigating to file on drive via app, for more ads & chance of seeing file after 3-5 minutes stuffing around."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"paid for the pro still wont allow me to save file to dropbox"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's kind of clumsy. It tries to emulate pc style controls rather than using Android style selecting tools and so forth. It's interesting in that it kind of emulates using a pc but it's not very user friendly for an android app. Not the best word processor got the platform."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like the app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Garbage! Couldn't save a file and then find it. Entered text, copied from else where and all previous work was gone. What a waste of time!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Buggy. Trying to Insert - Picture - From File opens a new blank document rather than add the image to the current document. Please fix ASAP!"

Edit: still can't save to dropbox even after you've started charging for it. So I've just paid  ¬£3 for a feature that doesn't work. Lousy business practice, right there. Sort it out please."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's okay, but I had problems with it starting initially.  The screen flashed on my Galaxy Tablet.  The interface is not always responsive, and the interface needs a redesign for tablets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Feature packed Office suite. This makes it a large app with some screen space taken up but well worth the functionality. Fantastic to see minimal permissions unlike some other apps that gradually ask for more permissions."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bad bad bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ŸàŸàŸàŸàŸàÿπŸá"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Bahasa indonesia"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Too much information for a small screen, but very good, worth using elsewhere when screen size and storage aren't restricted. Update, not much better over a year later and on a larger screen, the PC version is much better, would only use this if nothing else is available. Another update still no improvement, I can understand that with a mobile phone screen, it will be limited what can be on the screen, but on a 8 inch screen, I should be able to at least a whole line of text, without turning the keyboard off, it makes typing very difficult, not sure why the update required Identity, makes me wonder"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worked on my Samsung T110 Tab3 but only opens the same text docs as blanks"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I loved this App! Very simple & very easier to use like that PC format...also you can open all types file format (i.e) AI, EPS etc..."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice and use full application it is simply because helpful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The ads are real."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Screen display keeps flickering when virtual keyboard pops up in wordprocessor or spreadsheet application. Not sure about the other applications in the suite. Please fix. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app above anything else gave me just what I needed. Other apps I tried just were inferior in all aspects. Go for the pro version its a small price for such an appreciated work. Every update just makes it better and better. Keep up the great work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Improved your function"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very cool windows-like office app but not very suitable for mobiles"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"An exact port of OpenOffice for Windows, with every single feature intact. The highlight here is no other Android office app has as many features as AndrOpen and if your familiar with the windows version of Open Office or Microsoft Office then you'll instantly be familiar with the interface. However because it's an exact port it's a little awkward to use on my phones small screen; the program is seemingly more suited for chrome book. In the short time I used it I also encountered a bug that forced me to shut the app down. That being said the app has excellent potential and with further development could easily become the definitive office app for Android. In it's current state, especially considering I'm using a phone, there are just a few too many issues for me to continue using this. I will be checking up Andropen Offices periodically as updates are released and will change this review if merited. 5 stars for potential, 5 stars for included features, 3. 5stars for use on a phone screen. 2(?) stars for stability, based on the shirt time I used it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Epic App,  Works So Well, Awesome!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A little clunky but gets the job done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Not support font khmer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Simply great. It is a well made porting of our beloved OpenOffice suite. You can even export your files as pdf (an openoffice feature I really love). Unfortunatly it doesn't work properly on every device. I tried it on two different devices and while it works perfectly on one of them I cannot use it properly on the second one. Too many issues with mouse and keyboard tools."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Poor Now becuse it has many issues."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Or like this app from the moment I downloaded it. I've used open Office for years and was very happy to see how well this app work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Kono app wa kawai desu ne."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app works well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it is good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Screen too busy, no room to view or work. Probably, good only on a very large tablet!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"nice program, but the underline keeps coming on, you take it off press 1 key and it comes right back on"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Supports hindi fonts"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Download toh hone wala tha hua hi nahi"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"its very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Bagus, cuman perlu space gede, dan banyak Iklan yang mengganggu"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Iloved this app it contains whatever I want u must download it........."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The ads make its use and value dangerous because the ads have to be avoided and kept from an accidental tap. Before ads it was excellent. With ads it is hopeless and pitiful. I am unable to see the workspace. I have an older version without all the greedy ads crap that I will be forced to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"You shouldn't need to download a language pack to use east asian fonts ~ my phone already has them! I guess this is because the app runs samdboxed in some way, but it's obviously not ideal. Otherwise, great effort."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Well, what can I say? This office suite, just like it's desktop equivalent, really works well. I have been using OpenOffice on my Linux desktops for years, prior to now using LibreOffice (same thing, but FOSS)... Having put this Android version of OpenOffice through numerous tests since installing, throwing pretty much everything at it, it stands firm, no crashes, no lagging anywhere... Even though my screen is 5.5‚Äù, AndrOpenOffice UI is still very usable. Floating dialogue boxes are a nice touch that really help out with using this app to it's fullest on the smaller screens. I also like the fact I can use all my existing open source fonts, copied over from my desktop... As far as I am aware, there is currently no other app for Android that can correctly handle both 'open document format' and those created using microsnott office... Although I am a FOSS Advocate, I feel just about comfortable buying the 'pro pack' ? of AndrOpenOffice... So, a huge well done to the developer for getting this far üòÄüëç... EDIT: to devs reply, You're welcome üôÇ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love using the app This office suite remains one of the best office I have ever used in my phones and tablets. That is why I give it 5 stars.  Please, I want to know the features in the Pro-version. so that I can pay for it. Will I have all the fonts found in a desktop computer?  Please, the developer should also work on language recognition. If you type for example in French language or even in english, it doesn't detect the language and it doesn't correct the spellings and it doesn't underline the wrong spellings."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this app....."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Big size app !!!   It takes time to open an excell, other app only need about 15 MB, this App has 85 MB !!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's the best. This is not mouth-wash compliment. Tested and trusted"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"In the description, I see this app can support PPTM file. But when I use this app to open and run the pptm file, the embed macro don't work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a perfect replacement for office with tons of functionality. I think the developers have this app 100% spot on A1 from me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Lumayan bagus"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It won't accept passwords for new files. They don't take, and when you get them to work it tells you they don't match. I like to having a hanging indent. It is impossible to have a date an then an indented paragraph."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good in many ways but please tell me how to close the window after opening fill colours, I can't close it and it's driving me mad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Seriously, I love the app. But could you offer an option to hide the add-on apps from the launcher menu? Nothing ruins an app like clutter. I don't want to rate them down because functionality is great. The aesthetics are lacking, though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good. But need more improvement. Buggy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For ages now I've been after an office suite on android that could do at least some things the way excell did on the pc; change column widths accurately and so on.  This is SO much better!  Keep up the good work :-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Some nice work here, but the fonts menu does not scroll down with swipe until the scrollbar has been tapped. I recommend using PC mode instead, but ymmv."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great for my needs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Waist of space."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Get rid of the adds and make sure it works all the way round and I may try it again. I don't have time for adds on what is open source software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Yes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Rree good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks for porting this code to Android! This has turned my RCA Pro12 tablet with built-in hardware keyboard into the most awesome portable word processor I've ever owned."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Literal port of OOo. Useful in certain situations, such as when you need to sort text."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Why can't I use ""custom animation"" in presentation?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Will open spreadsheets only in read-only mode, so not very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This damn app has tooooooo many freakin ads that pop up especially when you are right in the middle of a document.   Crashes also if your screen times out then you have to reopen doc with running pop up ads in between!   Way tooooo damn annoying!    Was good at one time!   But sucks now!!!!!!!!   Now did an update and it won't even open any docs saved on my sd card!   Thanks a lot for this worthless waste of time app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"full stars!!! a lot of hard work and dedication through out the app, it's free but is great to resume or create office environment files that is fully compatible with Microsoft, yes it's had some bugs but at least it's always fixed and updated, I'm just not sure why people give it 2 stars and keep moaning?? big thanks to the development team, always a fan guys keep up the hard work!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Love the fact that this is such a feature-rich app and will keep coming back to it to see what progress is made. Sadly since I last tried this app it only opens my documents (.odt and .doc) as Read-only even though this security feature has not been applied and there is no way to push or convert it to an Edit or editable state. Nothing found in the Help files that stands out. Will probably be back in a few months to see if this is fixed as I do like this app. UPDATE: Appreciate response but 1) Other office apps have no problem reading, writing, opening, editing files from external SDcard. 2) The advice in the link is very seriously flawed and makes no sense. ""1. Select Google Drive in top screen"" What is top screen? Also settings menu nothing like what is shown."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Impressive work! I can't imagine using this on a phone, but it works well on my Playstore enabled Chromebook."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I had a good initial experience but have a problem now. A styles and formatting menu has opened and hides the work space. I cannot close it and it doesn't accept any selection. I've closed the app and rebooted the phone without success. I feel certain there's a way to fix it and hope somebody has a suggestion. It's super to be able to create a document and either save it as is or export to pdf."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its  great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the keyboard fix. This app works great. Can do my writing and save to Google drive and finish writing on my laptop later. Great for if your a writer. Keep it up."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I'm glad it's available, finally - but there are quite a few flaws. For one, overloaded with ads, which is surprising since the original is GPL and ad free. Second, its huge. Takes up 361 mb without additional add ons on my tablet. Third, it's laggy. The ui is too big. I used it for a while now, but I am quite sick of it's size, how it clogs up my memory and the beforementioned flaws. Going back to a different office up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Help, or lack thereof!  Where's the damn help?  Want to do something but not sure what those damn little pictures mean?  Press ""help"", easy right?  Wrong!

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Screen flashes due to ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"What a shame open office is a good programme but doesn't work well on a tablet. The controls are hard to tap, control boxes don't dissappear and clog the screen and the keyboard blocks the workspace."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Issue: Google and Other online storage sites do not update with new folders and documents. Dropbox updates almost immediately with new folders and documents.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The bug that prevented opening spreadsheets with passwords is now fixed.  Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"First, I think this is a great app! However, after the last update, previous saved files w/ password don't accept the password anymore. Files still can be opened in the MS version. Pls help..."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Use this on my tablet when I travel."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I use open office calc all the time on my windows PC and love it. I have a huge spreadsheet that I wanted to be able to use on my phone, so I installed this app. But my spreadsheet produces incorrect results using this program, so I have uninstalled it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is very process oremted app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks for this wonderful app. It's getting better and faster over time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Best office program i think. But, Data with vlookup formula all showing"" #name"" . Can you give me how to fix it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Disapointed, this didn't work on Note 4. Everytime I tried to save a new document, it refused and said ""general input/output error""? Really need a good open office App for Android that can create docs with a password."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"With all yhe fanfare, I tried this.  After using its Word-look-alike, I was sorely disappointed.  KB wasn't like anything.  Couldn't do cut and paste (to something else) after a few tries.  Buggy.  Not enough like OO or Word.  Very, very disappointed.  Very much different than my experience with OO, which I've used for years"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Rodriguez"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very slow on Notepad 4"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app it just has lots of performance issues."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Just downloaded this app on my Asus android tablet.  It is very very slow in opening up the database.  When it does, it won't let me open up any table, queries, forms or reports, and then it stops (crashes).  Very frustrated with it.  Also it will not open up in Google Drive on my tablet. Message says ""This file type is unsupported"".  It is .odb file.  I want to be able to use it in Google Drive so I can access it when away from my main computer.  I'll keep on trying to open my database on my tablet in the hope that it might finally work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Toooo good for students"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good effort though. 5 stars and a case of beer, if you can make base work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Why is it taking ages to open a simple docx and uploading and downloading at 1.3mbps? Wth could it be uploading at that speed?  I can't be bothered atm but can someone capture the packets and see what's going on.  Seems shaddy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Please add Hindi language add on."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Help, I am happy if you fix it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't want to update. Keeps going in a loop won't stop updating"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Been using this app for sometime and have been very pleased. But now my password protected spreadsheets (.ods) on android vrs 6 tablet and vrs 4.1.4 tablet are inaccessable, get error indicating a wrong password has been entered??? No such problem accessing the same files on windows 10 pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have tried to download update 5 times using up too much data. It keeps telling me to uninstall unused apps so I did this even deleting ones I use but only occasionally. Still get message. I AM NOT DELETING ALL MY APPS FOR THIS ONE. I save apps to 16GB MICRO SD card which has 13.2GB free now and internal storage of 1.4GB. This is still not enough? APP IS BEING DELETED AND REPLACED WITH SIMILAR APP.  OFFICE SUITE WITH PDF EDIT from MOBISYSTEMS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"not all of us have computers with android. still on phones you know?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Well, I used to love it. Now, not so much. In the past couple of days, the program started losing my data when I would save it. If I pressed Ctrl-S, it would go through the save and then close the document. It's not supposed to close the document! Then when I went looking for the doc, I couldn't find it anywhere. Not in the default directory, not in Dropbox, not anywhere.  So, I tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling it and it worked. For a couple of days. Then it started doing it again.  Sorry, I'm not going to let it fool me three times. I'll find something else. It's a shame because I really did like the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a great port of OpenOffice, a life saver on small mobiles and a wonderful tool on tablets. Later updates solved several memory problems, reducing internal memory usage to less than 90MB (I hope it will reduce even more) and there are no more annoying .obb files! Worked perfectly on a password protected .XLS file I carry around with personal data. It lacks touchscreen actions, as it is a port, not a native Android app, but I also hope that will come in time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Crash down when I work with .doc formats"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I loved my Psion 5mx and everything I could do with it, especially the office part. I am totally into mobile productivity.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice 5 star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"All the menu bars & formatting options of Microsoft Office (v 2000-2008 or so), so fully featured that it first seemed better suited to tablet than phone, but it let me hide toolbars I don't need. Allows me to keep files in older .doc/.xls formats. 1 tiny ad at bottom of file directory, no ads when I was using app, & 1 easy-to-ignore full-size ad on exit. I will probably upgrade to $3.99 ad-free pro version in a week!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Saya sangat merekomendasikan aplikasi ini untuk mengerjakan tugas office (excel word powerpoint). Sangat berguna dan sangat membantu. Bisa mengedit dan membuat task yang baru. Terimakasih atas aplikasi yang bagus ini. Semiga selalu maju."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"When using this excel sheet it does√±t always save the last cell or more you type in. Even if you hit save it does√±t always save. Using it on a ellipsis tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Right in the middle of an important edit up pops an advertisement. Within a short time it's a audio ad right in the middle of an important meeting.  How embarrassing and unnecessary.  P.S., I had just downloaded your app!! If you want people to use this app than either get rid of the ads or charge a small fee.  I won't use the writer for anything that I don't want the whole world to know about.  Every ad carries the possibility of sneaking malware onto someone's phone or tablet.  I like open office and I like this rendition but these ridiculous ads are a deal breaker.  User beware!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"You should use / familiarize yourself with the desktop version before trying to use a tablet / touch screen.  Also, this is full office edit so really need a keyboard attached.  Use a more lightweight viewer app for a phone.  Otherwise, an excellent first-cut port."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Edit: How do I go back to prior versions??    Review prior: This app is a reliable problem solving machine. Brilliant port. Many people have expressed a need for quality Android document handling. I was one, looking for something to solidly substitute sitting at a computer word processor. This is the documents app I waslooking for! Odt was easy to work on. Save is fast, &UI is amazingly cohesive! -Keep updating!"

Excellent app that replaces word. Thanks. Edit:no curly apostrophe? That's almost worth dropping a star if it wasn't such an easy fix when I'm at my pc. Please add that. One thing I also noticed it that it doesn't support highlighting. I kind of need my highlights, its how I flag overused words"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have had problems opening documents, but reinstalling it fixed that issue. Microsoft office and Libre office compatible, including custom fonts. Only won't print from Android 4.2 which is just a minor niggle, though I have found that exporting to PDF and printing from there works, the resulting quality of the print is exceptionally good even over WiFi."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing! The mouse and menu support is perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great port of my favorite office suite. Unlike MS Office for Android and others, this is not a stripped down version of desktop software.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I wanted to like this. Libre Office/Open Office is my wordprocessor of choice, on my Linux desktop. But there were far too many problems and irritations with itnd I had to remove it. When it overcomes those problems I'll look at it again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"After a long and rigorous search, this is by far the best Office app which I could find - after mastering the numeric pad and on-screen track pad! The only facility which I would like added is the ability to save in '.docx' format.  Congratulations on an excellent 'port' to Android."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"its nuts that there's a full version of open office for android.... and its even crazier that it works. that' right it works, its a bit finicky because of the small ui but the raw power makes up for it. and the best part is it can do everything open office does. yes that means 3d charts and objects. so yeah this is complete insanity that this exists and works. one minor complaint is that the left and right arrows don't work for page scrolling. but not much of an issue since you can just drag the page"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Worked before the update (and before the ads). Went to use it today and it wouldn't load so I updated it. Now it loads the ads and start screen but can't open a document, or start a new one. Uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Fully functional with a large xlsx cashflow file. Initially slower to open large file than MS Office app tested, but once open this is hands-down better. Also lets me save changes directly to the phone, unlike MS Office (cloud only? really?) Great stuff."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I've been using LibreOffice Viewer for a while, but that takes ages just to render the text in a simple spreadsheet. AOO renders it  almost instantaneously. First impression is excellent."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Didn't seem to work! Got stuck right after starting a document! Couldn't get it unstuck! Even after rebooting system! It's unusable!

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"What a difference 2 Updates Makes!  I was so excited to get my hands on a fully functional, Android ""Word-Relative"" (not a clone, but a kissing cousin).  AndrOpen Office had my attention for several days of delight mixed with growing frustration and finally disgust.  It had all the bells and whistles, but could not carry a tune.  There seemed not rhyme or reason to its crashes and refusals to start.  Notice of an update, renewed a spark of hope.  So, I uninstalled the buggy version, installed the new....Voila! It worked...and worked....and is delivering the promised great features!  Well done guys:-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A little clunky on my phone. But I've used open office since the 90s. I still love it. I don't consider using other productivity software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I had multiple issues with files corrupting.  Both .doc and the native open office format.  Seemed to get worse with time.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Hated it. Thought I would love it but it wouldn't let me out of screens & when it did it would jump like you were shaking dice. Ridiculous! I would close app & even opening app it would go to jumping on the same screen. Uninstalled!! Too bad it could be a good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I work with Open Office all the time on my PC, so when I needed to use my phone to create a mobile spreadsheet, Android OpenOffice was just great.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Has a few problems in Spreadsheets. There are zero instructions or tutorials with the app or online. None. . I wish there was a paid version, to avoid ads. Using either stylus or finger - You cannot select a group of cells. You cannot drag the contents of a cell or group of cells to another location, and you cannot pull a cell down to create (for example) a numbered sequential list; pull down ""1"" and get 1, 2, 3, 4,...  IF there is way to do these things and other tasks. Also, here it mentions digital purchases -- WHAT digital purchases??? None shown in app and none shown in Google Play store.  **UPDATE** The dev emailed to say that you can select a group of cells by double-tapping a cell and dragging in ""mouse mode"" - a virtual mouse, but I cannot seem to make it work."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have a Samsung Note 4 with 32gb internal and 128gb SD card and will run a hard drive  I purchased it to be productive as documents and spreadsheets are invaluable.  At first it seemed unstable but that was due to stylus in my hand unsteady I even tried another Wacom  stylus with sightly better results . Then a brain Storm came to this 6'4"" blonde ..yup air is thinner.. a wireless mouse and keyboard and it is a killer combination . I have tried and paid for other office programs that when opening MS office based spreadsheets grid lines disappear sheet size and margins change . AOO is the only one for me to date that that is not a issue. Reading other reviews that complain of external storage issues upon upload / download ...Really ? you have not learned yet as I have  that if it's not in your possession somebody else has it , Thus messing things up !"

Sometimes this app likes to jump from one point to another when you hit the space button. Other than that, it's not bad. I was used to Open Office on my PC with no problem but on a tablet it has a few issues."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Has all of the Bells and whistles of most office suites and word processors.  However,  while using it on my Samsung Note 10, 2014 version, everytime I go to another window it acts as though the power was shut down and presents a recovery screen requiring me to recover my documents that were open when I went to another screen. So I have to reopen the docs everytime I leave the window and come back to it. This requires that I scroill all the way back to whatever page I was editibnig at the time whether there are 2 pages or 22 pages. This makes editing documents very onerous. Will not order pro version as planned."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's difficult to understand"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The original app could be installed and run from from the SD card, the latest update forces it onto the main memory and refuses to allow it to move. Saying there is insufficient memory. Well there is sufficient memory, it is your app that refuses."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Using OpenOffice in a wrapper to make money is not a ""port"" of OpenOffice, it's shameful. Free and Open Source does not mean advertisement supported."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like what you can do with this app (not much out there can edit odt files), but it's really cramped on a phone. A mobile redesign would be nice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tried to open different odb databases some existing some newly created for trying app. None work properly! Can open all but all go 'read only' and present a black / blank page with no data.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great application ,,,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The notion of showing a full blown Windows style GUI is just plain silly.  It needs to have an Android GUI."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I've used OpenOffice (OoO) since long before Apache name showed up.  I'm not sure why Apache took over.  AOO works fairly well‚Ä¶ when it works.  It takes far too long to load and ALWAYS insists on recovering files ‚Äî which usually wipes out all the work I did!  This is very frustrating.  Half the time, by the time I redo the stuff AOO undid, my battery is down, my system memory seems full (judging by the slowdown) and it's time to save my work, which is beginning to look like wasted effort."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for over a year now and it has been great, I love it.  It is the only app available that truly works with and saves OpenOffice files in their original format, because it is actually OpenOffice ported.  Great to sink my work PC files with tablet for field work.  I find the virtual keypad & touchpad to be quite useful.  The developer is constantly providing updates and improvements, and is very responsive when a bug occurs.  Thanks for providing this, to me it is worth 5 stars and 5 times the Pro Pack price."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Some difficulty opening my odt files.  I had to download them from my google drive first, then open them."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is so useful, to able to work on docs and spreadsheets on the go. My only complaint is that it takes about a minute to load a fairly small (38MB) document. This may be in part due to my aging hardware (ASUS ME302C running Android 4.3)"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"On my home computers I use Libre Office, another version of OpenOffice and I like it. This version may work fine on tablets but not so good my Note 4 phablet. What I miss most is landscape mode. Because of the HD screen some icons are so tiny that I cannot recognise them. Navigation is difficult. I need some more testing before I decide to keep it or uninstall it. May 2016, now I am using a 12 inch tablet with a retina display. The application looks great now and I like features like the virtual touchpad. real good! I use the Clevis PC-type keyboard which works very good, better than all the Google junk."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is extremely unreliable. At first, I really enjoyed it. I used it to write on the go and then transfer my work to my desktop for formatting and the like. What I came to find out, is that the entire time, though I had written upwards of 6 pages per document, the app was only saving one of those pages. Upon transferring and word counting, I noticed that I was missing upwards of 10,000 words total. After reopening the app on my 2 in 1, the saves were as I feared, only one page. I am extremely upset about this and it is really a shame that this app gets the publicity it does. Obviously, anyone rating this high has not done any serious writing on it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Besiar khob va ali"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great alternative!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nevermind, I finally figured it out. There's another setting that needs to be changed when opening a file in the ""Other cloud storage"" option, it's the advance... thingy"

Its navigation modes mouse/touch/keyboard are central to its usability, considering cramped graphics controls, but the modes work, once figured out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is probably the best available free office for android. It works exactly like open office or libre office on a PC. Of course it all looks a bit squeezed on a small phone or pad screen but it all works and is a complete free open source office suite. Open Office for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ÿπÿßŸÑ€åÿπ"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Yes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Iovei it so much pls."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The only office suite I've found for my phone that will allow me to import images. So far I haven't been able to find any desktop features that aren't supported in this version. Even has the PDF converter. Extensive formatting choices"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"if this add the option for off-line dictation to this app it would have 5 stars  like miob pro has it  so if added I would use this app over it. its improving while it lags if they added more ram usage it would prevent lag mobile does it two instances in the ram over all. this app is great for being free use it with two other word apps... mobi pro being one of them"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very  cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I think this app is nice, but if I make a document I still prefer to work on my Windows PC. This app, IMHO, just for viewing and a very very little editing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Sux"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"But, it is now not letting me open my documents. So going to have to look for another program so I can work on them"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it.  Already accustomed to using LibreOffice and OpenOffice on PC,  I find it great to use the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. but..... I have a galaxy tab s 8.4 and one of the disadvantages I have found is the spell check and word completion functions are disabled when I attach the tab s bluetooth keyboard, which is a bit of a pain"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This so well stought out and works so well I can't believe it is free."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Runs great now.  Open Office on Linux was my favorite and now this app author has worked hard to provide an excellent port of a fine suite. Author also fixed a number of things in past week to make app work on my modest phone"

EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! Or the word ""I"" too!!!!! EVERY other word NOTJUST 9 OUT OF 10 NO - E V E R Y SINGLE WORD gets a number of spaces after it equal to the word length when you press space!!!!!!!!!!! ALSO will not perform a spell check OR thesaurus ALSO will tell you that your perfectly good password is incorrect. ALSO will save without saving!!!!!! ALSO does not have help installed. Open office on windows was very good ( although a bit slow) OO Android is worth 0 stars- I just can't choose 0!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just like libreoffice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app surely win down open document format editor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"New version will not access any of my files, turn off auto-updates.  Will not even create a text file or spread sheet, just crashes out back to AOO entry screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"After the most recent update, AOO crashes when trying to load a previously made text file. It seems to load, but switches back to the file display screen. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the program and nothing changes. I hope that the program is fixed soon. I'm using this on a Nook HD+ tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exactly like the other versions!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"First off, it is almost identical to the PC version of OpenOffice, so the learning curve is swift. I loaded a spreadsheet with some simple macros in it just to watch it crash.. It didn't! Flawless interpretation of both complex formulas and conditional formatting. The data validity formats work as well. The mouse pad and 10 key widgets work awesome (fairly brilliant as well btw). This IS a cross platform between Windows and Android. THE BEST I've come across. NO Need for any other Spreadsheet apps!! Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As a writer I use Google Docs for the majority of my writing,  but always use Open Office (or LibreOffice on PC) for formatting. This program is perfect for use with a tablet and keyboard. Very impressed it worked so well!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent word processor!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"When I try to save an ods document it often ends in error half the time and I can't reload the file. I use open office on my laptop and I wanted to be able to use my tablet as well using dropbox to edit files from either device. The failure to save properly has been most frustrating."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Accounting"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very nice to have OpenOffice equivalent on the tablet; I can dump the PC. I find the Samsung S-pen helps quite a bit. A huge step up from Google Docs and the usual text editors. Recommend saving work as one proceeds; sometimes unstable on Android 5.1. No biggie though. Recommended."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can't save files that I opened from Dropbox, the cursor jumps all over the page. It's ruined with this last update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ok..this app..awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its good,,, thnx"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Loved it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Ads with no way to get rid of them. Is there a paid version?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Love that it reads my odt file it won't type on the spreadsheet and I've had to reinstall it 4 times it keeps crashing i can at least input numbers to it not a clue if anything else works i don't need it all needs to be separates."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"If it weren't for this app, i would have been in detention for 3 months! It has alll these langues that im really imressed! Especialy Frenh, im lernin French, and have a long way to go, and this app makes it easier since i dont have a laptop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"we all the timeless app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Database component way too awkward to use. Darn."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am a user of other open source programs including open office for desktop. this app is great works well, stable and gets the job done also free no ads and functional like desktop version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office ever on pc or phone. Who knows what is office must love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Full screen ads on exit!  With sound! Junk!  I don't care how useful it is: deleted."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am editing large files and this is the only editor that works for me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works like the desktop version although the touchscreen aspect takes a bit of adjustment. My only qualm is I can't seem to find a way to support the developer. Awesome job!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It needs to improve its interface, they tried to bring it to mobile right from pc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I was about to give up and buy MS Office because I couldn't edit or reliably view my ODTs and ODPs on my phone, then I found this. With the ability to put missing fonts in a custom folder, I was able to open a 98-page document with images and charts and print a perfect pdf, just like I was on my laptop. This is great! Helps to have Hacker's keyboard installed for using arrow and F keys."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"OpenOffice on the PC is free. So I object to an ad playing when I close this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"At last an app that can open and edit ods files!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very nice. Big fan."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A real port of a desktop app. Limited only by the screen your working with. Just started but ill change my review ir need be but this is cool to have all the functionality of a desktop app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have Open office on my laptop and this works just like it. I personally like this program better than Microsoft Word. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes to type up papers or has to write many for school, it helps a whole  lot more than u would think."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful and well-designed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It does everything the pc version does and it even allows mouse input, and best of all it's free. If you're looking for a word processing app look no further..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Liked it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's very useful for my android phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Highlights blue boxes and freezes up making it useless. I've uninstalled and reinstalled nothing works very disappointing!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Familiar soft now on Android.  Excellent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was able to reinstall.  Thanks for responding so quickly and fixing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very appreciative of the effort to put together the port for this app. Anyone that wants to update documents in an Android device (phone, tablet, etc.) should have this application! Thank you very much! 5 stars for the vision and a job well done, and the wish that everyone should help the developer by buying the ""Professional pack""..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Very good app but each time you close the app you must then clear the cache from the settings menu otherwise it will not start again. Or rather I have to on my Galaxy Tab S. Pity. The update in 2016 wouldnt even install and forced me to unistall the working copy. Now I dont even have it as a workable app any more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Won't install. None of the suggested fixes work. Upto now has been a 5 star product"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's wonderful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"amazing app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hope this app last"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Apparently there was a recent update now it fails to open spreadsheets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"always update and fix from the developer make this app better and better. make me like this app again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You better f* do"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you very much for that port! It is great! It is true to say that a smartphone screen is small and that the keyboard takes some space but this is a very good job and even if it's not perfect, it is the real OpenOffice : it doesn't rely on a cloud service. You have the control of your files. Everyone should donate something, just because the dev made efforts to bring us that office suite on Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Nice this apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I liked this and used it a lot with my Asus Transformer TF101, but since I got a Samsung Tab Pro 10.1, this doesn't work anymore. :-( I look forward to a fix."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Some performance & compatibility issues. Really good overall though. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This has come a long way from the last time i used it. You can type and move and such. Still has some flaws. If the virtual keyboard isn't up while using a keyboard dock, you get double letters, and the interface is still a little janky. But, it's good and works. I hope it keeps making progress. Update: a backstep. It seems less functional. Can't close style, the keyboard blocks the document in landscape, and the interface is a Tad clunkier. I know this is a port of the program, and that is the issue."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"dialog fields not working stopp releasing bugging software, why the fu you are only one doing oo port????"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Update 12/16/15:  Recently found a problem, and the programmer fixed it in about a week.  Excellent email exchange, quick replies.  I originally had 4 stars, but have to add the fifth due to great customer service.  I currently use it on an external monitor, via Chromecast; along with bluetooth keyboard and mouse.  The app's ""PC Style"" works well with this setup.   --------- Handles every file format I can think of.   Too large to use on a phone screen,  but works well if scaled down and used on an external display with a MHL cable connection.   I can even pair up my Apple trackpad to use as a mouse."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not sure what happened but the last update was terrible. Now when I goto select the next box it selects multiple boxes!! Went from being a great program to a headache to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best open office ms compatible software with good cad/drawing program but takes up lots of space"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The only app I could find in the whole App Store that can directly open and let me edit OpenOffice documents made on my computer. Doesn't need to convert my files and does not corrupt them or anything. This app has ALL the features of the desktop OpenOffice and they work!! Thank you developer!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I can understand it being unable to display MS Word formatting that OpenOffice can't display (though that fact IS extremely disappointing). But OpenOffice CAN display my cover images! This does NOT. Also, it displays the navigation pane, which would be great if it could be used for navigation, but it can't. Every time I tap something in the navigation pane, it does NOT take me to that portion of the document, as MS Word (and SURELY OpenOffice as well) would do. So what's the point? Also, it closes itself every time I try to open large documents. EDIT: Now the navigator opens in a tiny pop up you can't even see/click the contents of. *Sigh* Take the ONLY feature I've been looking for that you HAD, and break it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I HAVE USED MANY MOBILE OFFICE BUT IT IS REALLY AMAZING APP ,THANKS FOR CREATING SUCH A AMAZING FEATURE APP."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"For some odd reason, the last two or three times in using this, the font size just spontaneously blew up in size and I wasn't able to reduce to normal no matter what I tried.  Maybe an update in the app has made this more likely?  And then installing to correct, the reinstall takes forever."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What is wrong? For example When i try to type 8.7 the ""."" Always move to the front like .87 cant use it for work anymore"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Work very not properly, very many troubles in hebrew language, impossible to work,chicken sheet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"And to top that off buttons so small I always get wrong one. Used to love open office on laptop but this version is junk!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What a shame, I really did want this to be the answer to my prayers... All I wanted was to place a Jpeg onto a document. Failed because ""Graphic Filter Not Found"" ...I'm not a geek, I have no idea what that means... In this apps defense it did 100x better than Microsoft Office App... Keep trying Akikazu! Good luck :-)"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Dear Dev, although I'm a FOSS lover, I failed to convince myself to use this app, since this is definitely not the interface one can work with on a pda especially smartphone. The interface needs some serious optimization. The idea of a virtual trackpad is a brilliant idea. But on &lt; 6"" smartphones, it is not good enough. Please make it optimized for touch enabled devices, in the lines of competitions M$ Office for Android, Polaris, Google, etc. Would be waiting for the upgraded version. Thank You."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Addon's very intrusive; appearance clunky reminds me of software years ago; will not recognize SD CARD; actual work area small in both text & worksheet. They should have waited before putting this product out. Their PC & MAC versions have always been 5 star. Disappointed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have OO in my 'droid! Full features üòÄ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I've gone through a lot of spreadsheet apps, and still prefer Open Office to Excel or Numbers.  Be aware the Pro paid upgrade seems to make it worse, not better. The ads disappear, but the space for them still shows and blocks your work until X'd out. Seems harder to dismiss a blank ad than a real ad. Stick with the free version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ads works as advertised"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its a bit small considering my tablet is small"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good idea poorly realized. When a ""service"" window is open (such as one to format text) there is no way to scroll: wiping down or up moves the entire window, and side bars do not work. Too bad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless app! Crashes Constantly and not at all user friendly! Don't bother wasting your time downloading and find a better platform to open documents."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Office was fine until the last updates when I could save and set the template. Stop screwing with something that was finally good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very wrong !! It's good but it's not compatible in microsoft office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Oke bingit"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A wonderful office package."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"On Samsung Note Pro 12.2 tablet, KitKat 4.4.2. AOO is non-functional. NO: spell ck, no changing top, bottom, side margins, no delete button, very difficult to place cursor highlighting 1-2 lines of type vs just placement, no cut/copy/paste. Most functions do not work at all. It doesn't crash is the best I can report about this app, sadly. Whereas, Open Office is a 5*. Very disappointed with AOO. Update 11/8/15: the app is progressively getting worse. It is totally non-functional now, basically. Can't correct an error without additional errors arbitrarily appearing; spaces appear or get deleted anywhere on text. Cursor jumps all over the text, capital letters just appears in the middle of the words, impossible to enter a date in this format (11/8/15), can't scroll the page up or down instead it enlarges page to an unruly size making it impossible to read/change/use, the back space creates spaces within the previous word (sometimes capital letters or a word in the middle of previous word), even with adding a dictionary spell check is totally non-functional or misspell simple words, extremely difficult to save (nearly impossible), I can't say one positive thing about this app."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app that i ever seen..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I use this almost every day on my Google Nexus 10 and have encountered very few problems. Without the comments that some people have made about ads, I wouldn't have known that this app even uses ads, since my firewall keeps them away. One minor issue: if I close a document and exit the app, the next time I open the app, the previous document is brought back, even though I had closed it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"downloading and installing are so so boring for me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app worked mostly flawlessly, (it had some minor bugs) untill I payed for the ""upgraded"" version. Now it randomly destroys files. Local, Cloud, Everything. Instead of opening them it wipes them clean. No Good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Who is the retard that thought ads with audio was a good idea in a productivity app?  I get the need for the ads to support the software, but a commercial during a meeting?   You ducking fipsticks!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Incredible a full port of one of the best Office suites available and still free. Then, no. It can't save to microsd cards or usb mass storage.  Fine if you are okay saving to a cloud storage and making your data available to unwarranted perusal. Not so good if you care about the right to privacy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Daddy oh"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I was excited to see Open Office available for Android. I use an open source office on my laptop and it is my preferred tool! Initially this app worked great and I planned to upgrade to support development. After the first update I can no longer access files or open new documents. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled in an effort to fix this. So far I haven't found any other way to contact the developers. Please fix this problem so I can upgrade this rating and upgrade to the app to support your work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Saving to dropbox doesn't save. Lost an hour of work, even tho I hit save every few mins."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Tested some of my spreadsheets I use for designing with complex interrelated formulae and everything worked as well as on a desktop. The interface, through a little odd with touch, works well and is a great match of open office for Linux. What an awesome accomplishment."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crashes upon opening an already created file or trying to create any kind of file."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The spreadsheet appears to work well but there is no help for it yet. For the experienced Open Office user, this is only a small problem. Until you use all the controls, you will be fumbling around. Like, there is a simulated mouse which can be used to set ranges for replicating formulas. (Now was that that hard maybe just to list as a preliminary help?) Just the same, THANK YOU for this app! Good bye Polaris Office 5."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Long time Open Office user...  love it on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't bother if you plan to edit xlsx files. It saves everything as an incompatible file that can't be used by the original program. It can't be read or changed by drop box either. Completely useless as an editing tool. Uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its really helpful aap !!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"That is the message I got after trying to install it. I have no storage problem and have a Samsung GT-S7580."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is awesome app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ÿπÿßŸÑ€å"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really simple to use if you use a physical keyboard!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"But can't really complain about that... Ok - could - but won't.  :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Harika"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well when I've used it.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"with Galaxy tab 4 pressing the space bar duplicate the last word rendering typing anything totally useless.  Also bought the pro version but I keep getting ads.  Otherwise it looks like a nice app if I could use it at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I only had this app for a few days but regretted every minute of it. It pushes you to save files in a format it can't open, routinely erases saved documents and freezes like a puddle for no reason. Don't waste your time."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I was expecting more from this app. It needs a lot of work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Difficult, but powerful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It keeps saying ocr mismatch when I want to open excel. Hey! Help!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"PDF conversion of vendor-locked school assignments is awesome by itself, not to mention the rest of the functionality.  Excellent job."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fullscreen ads are a little annoying, but dont intrude in the app. Good functionality"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I finally got a REAL office suite on my Android tablet instead of some dumbed down one. Fully functional with an invaluable pop-up mouse!!  As my way of saying thanks,  I sent my monetary support your way (which got rid of the ads of course).  Keep up the awesome work!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I dont known what is he"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent full office suite ‚Äì true port of open office and regular users of that app know full well how 99% compatible it is with bill gate‚Äôs word and excel.   Emulates Microsoft compatible pointing device with pop-up touch mouse and as with all Microsoft platform Emulations the app has an annoying ribbon taking up to much space. However, play with the options and iconize widgets and you can keep most of the screen for the body of the document. Adware ?  of course it is ‚Äì it‚Äôs otherwise free. However, you don‚Äôt have to login nor sign up to an account or even switch on WIFI ‚Äì unlike it‚Äôs widely advertised ‚Äònuclear missile‚Äô namesake competitor which in my opinion is well relegated to a 2nd place runner. A life saver for me when I was on holiday with only a market entry 7‚Äù screen Tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"so tired of the stripped down ""word processors"" ... a full fledged office suite finally. thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I am happy that open office concept is brought to android. But just to point out, you guys got to see how this app interact's with users in comparison to other Android office apps. I am a fairly good computer user, I was not able to find the file, I want to open , with this app. Though the file was in download section. I want this app to be the best. Henc?e suggesting for more improvement's."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"24.09. 2015"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is definitely a port of OpenOffice, and maybe that's a bad thing. Even on the relatively large Galaxy S6, the screen is cluttered and leaves little room for text. Also, it's adware."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good and useful app but need some correction for  high end tablets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I really wanted to like this app but when you save a file using the 'save' option rather than the 'save as' will corrupt the saved file (at least on the note 10.1).  Fortunatly I keep backups so only lost a couple of days worth of notes, but an office package that I can't rely on the save function and worse will wipe out previously saved data is of little use.  This happened multipul times, with multipul documents and always seemed to be related to the 'save' function.  This is at best an unreliable office suite at this time.  Maybe a update will fix it but as it stands right now it is dangerous to use for anything important."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I really want to give the aoo app 5 stars but the auto spell check doesn't work, that's a huge feature I use. Get that working and I'd happily rate this 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I can open my files from LibreOffice/Excel"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"And lots of ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I'd like to see a keyboard add on for android phones/tablets so you can control android TV box's, tablets and pc's using this program from your phone keyboard. Possibly create a streamlined version for older dualcore devices that aren't quite up to its full capabilities. ..Plus ever thought of backing this collosal program with a free illustration app and photo editing software? Such as gimp and inkscape. A little co-operation between developers would go a long way ;-) ace.. Love it! 6 out of 5 from me :-P      ... I am having trouble with the spellchecker. It doesn't seem to work on android platform. Surely it could use the pre-installed android/Google dictionary? Any help or update on this matter would be appreciated thanks. Chris"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"but it covers the whole screen when the virtual  keyboard comes....please fix it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This App is not working in Note 4 (G). Non-responsive, FC in few seconds. I was hoping for Full Office Suite after reading the reviews but disappointed. Dev please Fix. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app. I found the trackpad really helpful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This appl  is  very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's the way to go. I love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Excessive lag, unresponsive. Galaxy note 4"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is nearly impossible to type in a spreadsheet with the SwiftKey Keyboard (a popular 3rd party digital keyboard). I need to switch to the stock Samsung keyboard to type without spacing issues."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Next... GIMP! A full featured GIMP port!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tried to install but it is not instaling"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"good aplication"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was away from this app for a significant time due to my tablet going corrupt. Got a new one and this aoo has evolved a lot. Now using it with combination of Microsoft office apps, Google office suite. Great!!üòÄ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's really a useful software, I love it ......"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what I want it to with ease."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great functional"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow that's awesome ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Got on my computer and phone use drop box to keep files linked find better than Microsoft office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"vety helpful !!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Hoping it will work offline. If so I will upgrade rating."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"In rare cases, like with this program, fully featured software can make it onto the mobile platforms. Turn off the scrollbars, some menu bars and the rulers, and you have a perfect, clean yet feature packed office program, truly free and with essential stuff like PDF generation ability. The only app like it, paid equivalents are always feature reduced. This is desktop-identical LibreOffice, no comprises, in fact it even has some nice extra menus for convenience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpen Office is very useful on my work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Bam"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A good alternative for your personal computer.. You'll never miss an assignment with this in your android phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I could never use it on my Note 4. The GUI is much too busy for a small screen, the virtual mouse doesn't work, it always opens with the exact same file recovery dialog, and the ads are a bit too intrusive. It would be well worth a try on a tablet, though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Im Always Alone boy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A app that rivals with Microsoft windows"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Slow and cumbersome on Galaxy Note 10.1. Doesn't respond well to pen input. Keyboard takes up half of screen so it is hard to navigate."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i think will be fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So far so good, I first thought it was OpenOffice for native Android, but was blown away to find out it was X11 in Android running OpenOffice. I used another ODF app but was just a viewer only, and editing was at best limited. This lets me open and edit my documents. But as others said, and I agree, remove the fullscreen ads. I can deal with banner ads on the bottom. Otherwise, awesome app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Needs an option to get rid of the pop-up ads. They are horribly annoying and a big disappointment with the last update. Other than that the interface has been dramatically improved and is very usable now, even without an external keyboard and mouse. The new track pad is a really helpful addition."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"When typing in Hebrew, anytime I hit the apostrophe or quotation marks (used frequently in Hebrew for abbreviations) the word I am typing disappears."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"After the 8/24/15 update, AOO has twice now corrupted my Dropbox file, forcing me to manually restore a previous version. This app is essentially broken for Dropbox users. Beware."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Soo good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The file is too large"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I would love a paid version without ads. I'll be the first in line to buy it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It was downloading from my drive which I was very happy about but just want opening it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Amazing - finally an app that allows furigana! The layout may not be best suited for tablets,  but I believe I will use this. Thank you!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Please fix this for M-706"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The updates screwed the document saving, terrible system, loose it, fixing things that aren't broken is really stupid, loose the updates ruined a decent application with BS"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I've got a small, basic tablet and it can't cope. Get the feeling that an external keyboard is the only way to get the most out of this app on a small screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Exelant"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Had to Paul up a box list to get first line indentation.   The box blocks the screen and won't close.   Overall this program is not so user friendly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Goood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its seems perfect for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Membantu pekerjaan saya.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You can do everything here that you can do in the desktop version. However there are a few glitchy sections and things that don't work as smoothly. Likely due to being a direct port of the desktop version, some of this will likely never be fixed. Still a great app though!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For some reason it doesn't display internet sourced images in documents, but still deserves 5 stars as THE ONLY android app able to edit .odt files. Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a lousy, encumbering application, that not only doesn't work, but bombards you with strange advertising for useless applications."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Needs useless Google Play Services and asks to download more stuff to do anything. Not very useful."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I recently purchased AOO. Unfortunately, it doesn't not work correctly on either my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 or my LG G3 phone. When I type the letters or numbers overwrite the previous one. Type a word, and all you get it the last letter typed.  However, I think I've discovered the reason. I use the SwiftKey keyboard on both devices. Changing the keyboard to the stock device keyboard seem to fix the problem. Change back to SwifKey, and the problem reappears.  Considering that SwiftKey is the most popular Android Keyboard with millions of users, it might be a good idea to see if this is fixable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i love it, im excited to use it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Basically they just took someone else's free program and added intrusive advertisements"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have t on computer so why not on tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I wish it could support s pen properly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best office package"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It's got everything you want except for one thing, the ability to see what you are typing. I can't use this in any meaningful manner without stopping after each work to see if it's correct. Please fix this by making the banner smaller or by toggling it.,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's so easy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"When I bring up the screen keyboard in landscape mode, the region I'm typing into is obscured. Gesture typing now inserts spaces automatically but not all the time. Keep up the great work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Buggy as hell. Constant, inexplicable quirks make this utterly unusable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"What more can I say. Love OpenOffice. Love Androgen Office Port.  Oh, if you, like me, don't want to deal with ads, the Pro extension is dirt cheap at $2..."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like this a lot! But is there a way to get arial font or times new roman added on?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The buttons for the keyboard and number pad are right over the buttons to scroll left and right on my spreadsheets. I wish those buttons where not there at all. Would of been a great app if I could of actually used it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Now stops crashing vs 2.2.0, tables seem to work correctly, not sure if it's this app or being on android 5.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It has many features... No other words"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpenOffice has all the features of the original OpenOffice (reading Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents, exporting .doc to .pdf, all the menus, dialogs, and settings, etc).  It's also an open project which is USEFUL, not a fad.  The interface takes some getting used to.  But, that's more of an Android issue than a problem with AndrOpenOffice.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Pro version should not called open office. All open software are supposed to be free."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The app was a bit slow, and a little cluttered. Its nice I if you need the full blown OpenOffice suite, but makes it quit clunky to use. That many buttons plus banner ads mean its easy to fat finger an ad, opening a browser and interrupting the workflow. Add the obtrusive popups, and its an app with too many minuses for my needs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Working OpenOffice on my Android phone, what else to say :-)"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I was looking for office softwares and I found this the best but as my phone internal memory size is small...play doesn't allow to download. I would be greatful if you could make this app with in-app download feature as the large games do have...app size stays small and rest of the data goes to /Android/data/""app_name"".."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works well on my galaxy note pro 12.2 use often for school English class etc the best office suite for desktop now on android I also like the on screen touch pad better than it was before well worth using"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this program so much."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very good but I want more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very powerful and needs about 300-400Mb of free space to function properly. The down side for me is that it is not user-friendly on a cell phone, but should live well on a larger tablet screen. It has some growing up to do to be truly ready for the smaller screen. Too bad, I really like AOO."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Editing my invoices and saving as pdf perfectly.  Works great, bar a few kinks that I'm sure will be sorted in the near future.  Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"loved the concept of it as I use open office on desktop but EVERYTHING i opened just froze, ie I'd open the font drop box to choose a font and it would STAY dropped down with NO WAY to close it and each time i just had to close the app completely BUT on opening again the SAME frozen box was STILL open. Loved the fact of NO ADS but totally unusable for me. But good concept. Uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I did not expect the un-ending train of spam that it flings onto my screen at the conclusion of every task. ""Real"" OO doesn't do that. Otherwise, it is OK, given the limits of a tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the one I'm looking forward"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I use Open Office on my laptop but sometimes I need to type out stuff while on the road or just being out-and-about in general.  Sadly this application crashes so often I can barely use it.  Also the size of all the icons and stuff can't be adjusted for smaller screens."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As someone who works a lot while on the road, and has tried nearly every other office app, I think AOO is the only suite that has every feature I  need (and would otherwise miss when not using a desktop program). There were some problems at first due to the small size of the menus, but once I adjusted to using them and the side menus, AOO proved really useful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I  love it  so much yay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Able to load files and edit with ease. I've been writing my papers for English on this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Lovely"

The first impression is that this App can make it to be the best. Very nice looking menu bar and all commands are there but I need space to experiment and  the keyboard is in my way."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I waited ages for an Open Office type app. Tried various others which nearly drove me crazy. This woeks really well generally especially as I've used Open Office for years. I do find it sometimes does peculiar things with a template such as doubling and off-setting the header. Also although you can set tabs my Xperia keyboard doesn't have a tab key so I haven't worked that one out yet. Otherwise a really useful app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"99mbs nope"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good version of office, that meets our needs! Some small issues, nothing major as of yet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good. I like it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"fantastic"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It looks like a great port and should work very well on tablets with big screens, but it's unusable on my Moto G because of the available screen space, worsened by the fact that it doesn't run full screen (feature request!). If I had a tablet I'd certainly use it there, but unfortunately I have to look into other options."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Really need x86 support."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Every time I try to open it crashes plz fix I have assignments due n this is the perfect app for all my school work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Crashes every time I open it on my x86 devices.  Not only are more  Android phones and tablets being offered based on X86 processors, but there's also the Android X86 project that's bringing Android to the desktop/laptop space (MUCH faster for most functions on an X86 processor with 2 - 4GB of 533 RAM). From what I've read, it's a simple change in the compile procedure to rebuild this in X86. That will pretty much guarantee 5 stars from me, because this is the most powerful office app in all of the play store!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love it, I can open and edit my PC's office program"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not really optimized for small devices (galaxy note 4 here, so actually far from small), but works and is open source. 5 stars when ui is better."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"10 Mar 2015: The latest version no longer works on my Galaxy 12.2 tablet...an unpleasant surprise when I grabbed the tablet for a quick edit of an important document only to find that it was no longer possible to enter text or even move the cursor around in a document.  The banner page is a mess as well, with the AOO logo overwriting other text.  Luckily, Rollapp for Chromebook did the trick and the document was finished on time, but no thanks to this latest release of AOO.  Even though unusable on my tablet, still giving it two stars since it has been a wordprocessor workhorse for me up to now.  Previous: Hats off to a Great Port, but not 100% Tablet Friendly 1 Feb 2014: Just upgraded to 5 stars after using it a few weeks.  On a Tegra 4 processor with a mouse pointer, this app is incredible.  My platform is a TF701, which is a laptop-tablet (laplet?). The latest version of AOO is adequately stable for me to run my business on it.  Previously, I was using Windows 7/Excel for the business.  Note: Response on anything less than a Tegra 4 was very slow, so AnderOffice did not work with my complex spreadsheets on those systems.  Mouse needed to point to small menu items."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Awkward, bloated interface. Doesn't actually save work. Practically unusable on smart phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"First of all, I'd like to say I'm using Android in a laptop form factor. It works very well with my trackpad, and it is far more featured than other office apps I've used. Google Drive integration could be better, as it does not let me save locally, and uploads do not always complete. For local editing on an Android laptop, this is a great app.  P.S. For those who need spell check, download the dictionary of your language from Apache's website and open it. It will ask if you want to install the language pack. Select ""Yes""."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"can make fix... device is slow..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Pretty good for the Android, but really needs the SpellChecker working. DunKnow where my Dictonary is it fadded away years ago?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Worked half way decent on my android until the update. Now the backspace doesn't work and you can't add any pics because you lose the capability to edit, delete, or do anything with the document (even save) once the pic is added (and forget about resizing the pic...) Haven't gotten any further since I can't, to see what else is wrong..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Why bother making an app that covers the document to where you can't read it.  Keyboard in the way all the time. Not one app yet that can display a header to edit. Worthless like ms office mobile."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"awesome...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Crashed on first run. Nobody said anything about ads. It's a real shame because there is a real need for OpenDocument support on Android beyond the lip-service Google pays to open standards.  Immediate uninstall."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It Keeps Foreclosing on me unless  install it to my sd card, and the drawing feature in the text document needs alot of work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"A tablet isn't a PC. The GUI is hopelessly clunky without a mouse and keyboard. OK if you're desperate to open OO files on Android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This one is better than the other apps I have tried. However, it does not have all the features I am in need of; like header options for a running head. The appearance is horrible as well!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"but since it's pretty much a direct port of the desktop version of OpenOffice, it's too hard to use on mobile devices, sadly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Can't access the table design section on Samsung Galaxy s5. It enables you to access the queries, forms and report building section but not much use until you can build a table"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Office Suite"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Faithful, full-featured port of Open Office, though somewhat difficult to use on small screens. This is a limitation of the hardware, though, and not of the software. Use of an external is _highly_ recommended, even for use with tablets. I use this app on a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Tab 3, with a Bluetooth keyboard I bought at Walgreens for $10. The only issue that I've experienced is that the app crashes in landscape mode on my Note 4."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Full of ad banners...  So went to trash."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It helpful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I like the idea of an open office suit for android. But the desktop version remains a desktop version and is very difficult, at times even impossible to handle on a smaller screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A little reseach on how to add the spell checker; but, I've been using it on my LG 8.3 with a Zagg keyboard and love it.  You have to know how to use the alt key and remember to switch between mouse and the tablets default swipping model for right clicking, etc.  Best office product for android - mainly replaced using my laptop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Glad to found this, nice job! A bit slow but is to be expected for *OO on a phone. Works amazing. On a tablet it would be even more lovely. Thank you."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"w/4.4.2.  TORTUROUSLY SLOW regardless of what I tried to do whether with touch, mouse, or SPen. Could not possibly recommend this app for same device. Frankly, I'm not terribly impressed with the Note Pro (my first tablet), as it doesn't provide anywhere near the speed or functionality of a notebook or laptop. This app on this device just made it seem even worse. Caveat emptor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"What you need for a tablet when yo do not have access to pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This Is AMAZING on Computer...  But app?  NOT REALLY.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I believe it is a same issue as  potatohead5309  wrote, considering Dropbox as network source.  I did try to edit some file from Dropbox, everything was fine, open file from Dropbox, choose AndrOpen to edit... edit... save... and this file never appear at Dropbox.  Did it again, edit, save... and i saw file is saved locally on the tablet, at the Dropbox folder... synchronize... and nothing. File not appear at Dropbox.  I am sure goal of this software is to edit your files anywhere, not just locally. Please check and try to solve.  Anyway, ill give 5 stars to this software as it is a huge help. Thanks for your effort."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Is it possible to include √ó and √∑ symbols as well as * and / ?  Some devices do include them on their keyboards, such as the Samsung Galaxy Note tablets. Otherwise, everything I have tried so far seems  to work as well as the PC versions."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its the most frustrating app ever.  Yes it may open docs but its a nightmare to edit them.  The entire screen is filled with menus. Then when you try to type the page will jump to a random area.   I've waited for a year for it to improve but it will be easier just to dump open office all together."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Identical with computer version + works very fast. Has no competition on Play Store."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Nice attempt,good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Hope it's like open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you. I can tell how much work went into this. It's an amazing program..I hate microsoft and I'm very happy someone ported this program over. The functionality is amazing..A couple versions later can you please make the gui (ie toolbar buttons a little bit more pleasant to look at)..Other than that, Thank you!!!! You are amazing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Today I opened the document across the network and assumed the app would save the document in its original location. My brief idea turned into a solid 2 hours of work with regular saves. When I reopened the document I found that none if my 20 pages were on it. I assumed then it would be local on the tablet, and it was BUT by the process of opening the file across the network the app cached the network file writing overtop of it. I lost 2 hrs and 20 pages."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I'm sure this was my fault but the keyboard is always active which made navigating a spreadsheet really hard. There was a little keyboard icon but it didn't seem to do anything.  I've found other apps like polaris make the keyboard available intelligently when you select a cell to edit. Also the keyboard icon was in the way of the tabs which represent each sheet in multi sheet spreadsheet so I couldn't get to some sheets. This is a pity because I use open office on my desktop and polaris doesn't support odf"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I love open office on my pc but this mobile port fell short by a mile. As I was trying to type up a rough draft of a lab report I noticed that nearly half of the words I was typing never made it on to the document. I thought I might be going too fast for the app to pick up so I slowed down. Still, a lot of my writing disappeared. If it weren't for this giant bug, I might have kept using the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Only office suite I've tried that fails at all, and does so abjectly. Cannot open existing document or create new one.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately it does not work on my Inspiron 910 using Android 4.4."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"With a keyboard and mouse connected,  this app works like a dream.  It will handle things most other office suites for android cannot.  Best of all,  I can open my odt docs and save them as doc or docx on the go!  Very useful,  and each update makes it easier to use on a phone as well.  Great job, dev!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Just add the page setup vizard  like orientation to export docs easily i n PDF"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its really helps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not bad for mobile, but it does have a hard time opening big files Good port. I managed to put the ions on small, but I realised I could not see all the menus and could not scroll down using mouse or keyboard(I dont have touchscreen). Comparing to photos, i knew options should be last in the tools menu, so I used my keyboard to access the bottom(it would not show on screen)-most icons and it was indeed options, from which I turned off icons in the menus(and with this only can I see all the menu items)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good idea but very slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Horrible horrible layout."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A nice port of OpenOffice to Android. Gives a full working office suite that performs as well as Libre Office on my Linux desktop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a great desktop suite but it fails to run on the N6. I've used it on other phones and tablets. Please look into this and I'll rate again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"But the document writer does. Uninstall"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been waiting a long time for a port of OpenOffice. Now it's here! I appreciate your work. Keep it up! (y)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What is the point is this application?  To open Microsoft Office files?  Well, I guess it does that, but there are much better options if you just want to read files.  I was hoping this app would allow me to open and edit ODT files i had transferred to my phone from my computer. BUT YOU CAN'T!  The app has a very hard time opening the files, and when it does manage it, YOU CAN'T EDIT THE READ ONLY FILES!!! And you can't save files either! This is worthless."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not having a native version (having to launch X) really sucks the life out of this app. Would be great otherwise ‚Äî I'm dying for a full service spreadsheet application on my tablet and not even Microsoft has delivered."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Now my tablet is a replacement for a desktop. Use an external keyboard and mouse for better use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is the bridge between my desktops, phone and tablet. Great job!  I would buy this."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is not truly designed for a tablet, but if you have one that can work with a keyboard and mouse then it's a great find.:-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"When I used this it was better than then notes I got to draw and other stuff"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Full featured app with WebDAV support. Requires screen with sufficient resolution and size as with most text editing apps on Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Considering what has to happen in Android for this direct port to work, I'm really impressed. It functions on my Samsung G3, but the lack of screen real estate makes it a bit cumbersome. However, on my Galaxy Tab Note 10.1 it is far more useable. If you like the real Linux desktop experience of OpenOffice, you should really like this. If none of this review makes sense to you, you'd probably prefer a totally different office solution."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Much better then expensive cousins! My CUDOS to the programmer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A little glitchy but still perfect enough"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use Libre office on my desktop. With this on my Galaxy Note 10.1, and this app, I can actual use my tablet as a viable laptop replacement. This app works great on my device"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like very much"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good for job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very gooooooood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The ui is torture.  Spare yourself the misery and use anything else."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good for office and personal use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good app thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cant hide keyboard on LG G2 and interface is full of bugs and hickups. Completely useless!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"absolutely unbelievable!!! best app ever seen!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hi cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Not really for phones, but what office suite is?  This one worked on my tablet for Word docs. It is usable on an 8"" tablet with a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. It would be ideal on a 10"" android tablet as your word processor. They should add a quality grammar checker extension and continue working out bugs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever used. Can't email anything, just brings up the email app but doesn't attach the file. Opens from Dropbox but can't save to it. Zooming is erratic. Doesn't support swype text. Extremely bloated, very minimal viewing area. I have to scroll after every 6 lines of text I write. All these issues in a one-time, 5-minute use. Uninstalling and calling my therapist for more Xanax after the most frustrating experience with any technology in my life. And I work in IT."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its great to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Complete but slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just installed this on a fairly powerful android tablet, and it seems to work like a charm, giving me a fully featured Open Office. Whether it would be much use on a phone with a small screen I'm not sure, but for my tablet with an attached bluetooth keyboard it is just what I was missing to turn my tablet into a super-portable all-singing all-dancing laptop replacement. Very nice! Many thanks!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It didn't even open..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Design is well but it lags too much"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is not a true mobile app and suffers badly for it. Would possibly be OK on a pad but on my note3 it is just too crowded. It doesn't allow editing of documents as it only opens them in read only. It also opens documents created in open office incorrectly and is a waste of time for it all. Rubbish app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Update! update!! update!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I can just do my Administration work anywhere"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not bad ......"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"its compatible with Microsoft office formats but its formatted like office 2003"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Don't like the interface"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent software but so big to install on android mobiles"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Install Samsung 8. No problems and no bugs so far.  Has mouse mode for moving text. Have to use in portrait due to screen limits, but very usable. Nice job."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"How are yoy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is good and easy to use so I gave it 5 star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Definitely impressive to have ported this to Android.  But, the desktop experience doesn't translate well on a mobile device in some ways.  Looking forward to the continued development of this and hopefully a better mobile device UI experience in the future."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It writes anything it wants. Almost no command using Swype or voice recognition"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I think it is one of the best apps for android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bad adware. Ads crash the program. Disappointed and uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I have now installed this app three different times, and it has yet to work AT ALL.  I love open office for Linux,  and am dying to have a usable, fully functioning office suite for Android, so please devs, don't give up on this.  --Acer Iconia A500"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crashed my Asus!!!!!"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"New docs, spelling don't work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is really not optimised for little android phones. At least for me, keyboard take the whole screen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Very slow downloading process."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keren"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"looks exactly like pc version, but seriously not suitable for phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"A shame but so flaky I have uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"see is not support my phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Te UI is awful and feels like a 10 years old Linux computer! Not touch optimized and not designed for tablets (forget about phones!). Just a pure port of Open Office. And yes, it works. But it's slow."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I download it, open one file and it works. When I try to open a file later it says it crashes. I've had to redownload five or six times now."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Try it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't possibly read any document because the interface is huge and the keyboard refuses to be hidden."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I HV little PC........."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Faltu"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Its not connecting and downloading like it should why?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The program seems to be a direct port of the PC version, making it awkward to use on handheld devices. Add to that the fact that every time I save a file the program has a good chance of losing the file and having to recover it. This program is not worth losing your work, I'll stick with Google docs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"What's with the huge keyboard display when in landacape mode? Can hardly view the files! I hv since deleted this huge app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is unusable of smartphone and should be set to tablet only. Or you should reprogram the menu...  ◊™◊û◊ô◊õ◊î ◊ò◊ï◊ë◊î ◊ë◊¢◊ë◊®◊ô◊™"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Awful. Keyboard would not go away. Did not recognize my password from a downloaded document. SLOW. Deleted it in 10 minutes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect! Now true complete reciprocity w/ the desktop & portable apps on a flashdrive! Nothing comes close. But wait.can't it save to ext sd card on android 5.0? Kit-kat disabled this but it can be re-enapled on lollipop. Can this app save to sd on lollipop? Tnx."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Apache Open Office does not make a Android version of AOO. I would give it ZERO stars but you have to give it something. IT IS NOT APACHE OPEN OFFICE."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Goood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you very much! The best Office app for Asus Transformers! Works great with mouse and keyboard!!!! Many-many thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I've used Apache on my laptop for years and Love it. I got this for my Note 4 and I can't get the keyboard to go away at all. It's absolutely useless in landscape. In options and customize most of the options are only half of the words...non legible. I am beginning to wonder if it's comparable with the Note 4. I wouldn't think it would matter...still KK 4.4.4. I don't know. Oh...and you can't get to the about section. When u pull anything up there is a big black X over the right top corner of program."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best free office for android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've only played with the app so far, but they seem to have done an excellent job of porting."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is great I liked it. Initially you struggle to get into its functions. Once you play around it several times it's a good program. Far better than Microsoft who charge exorbitant funds for their same              software after adding one improvement."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Too many updates but I'm not having any issues with repeating characters using a Bluetooth keyboard as another reviewer commented. I love Open Office / Libre Office and this adaptation for Android. Many many thanks to those who created this."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I used OO on my PC many years and liked it but this Android app simply does't do anything on my Samsung Tab Pro 10.1 running 4.4.2. I can't open existing docs nor create new ones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is very good app for office in android which provides nice editing on android . I just unsatisfied with its user interface . So try to improve ui of the app . Use the metalic design from android l ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Kept crashing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"the app opens, but it can't start any of the office programs or open any files already on my phone, restarted phone, reinstalled app, nothing worked, uninstalled and moved on"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great alternative to office suite"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app helped me wrote in better than docs to go. Rich features almost same as linux version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"For some odd reason none of the word documents I generate will save on the Samsung Tab 10.5. Keeps coming up with a General Error. Any help or bug fix would be appreciated."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its a bit slow to load at start up, but you have all the functionality of a computer version!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Unable to install update if app was moved from device memory to sd card"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Level of polish, typical of open source, just ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing to have this app on my phone and tab s."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app last few days. No problem using it. Didn't get app like this for documentation. I can use same like Open Office in my laptop. Thanks to open office team."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Had high hopes for this office suite from the pics but unfortunately it won't open documents without crashing. So disappointed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Now fixed for Android Lollipop, thank you. :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Useful for when you need it but a bit buggie and very ugly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This apps main strength is that its available on both Android and Windows. Unfortunately this port is somewhat lacking (like a lot of the MS Office wanna be's). For starts there's the fact that the keyboard takes up the majority of the screen. When coupled with the toolbars and other stuff, all you see of your document is a narrow ribbon. You can switch parts of the toolbars off but when you close and reopen the app, it all resets back to default. Also has a really annoying thing happening where you're editing a document, hit save, close and reopen and none of the work you've spend an hour putting in has been saved. Complete time waster. Also no support for touch scrolling relying on scroll bars. Needs a lot of work for me to give it a better rating."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The biggest issue I have with this is the painful load times on my 2012 Nexus 7. Then again, OpenOffice opens slowly on windows too. You really don't want to use this without an external keyboard..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Does not open any file"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Appreciate the dev's efforts to bring OO to android platform. The app works fine, but it isn't so good for small screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Trash!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Keeps freezing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"After selecting the keyboard the keyboard pops up as normal but the  rest of the screen is black. Which unusable me to use the keyboard and type."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It is virtually unusable on small screens, but of you have a large tablet, I imagine it would be somewhat better.  An adjustable touch interface would be a big improvement."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Otherwise an excellent app, but I deleted it after it became clear it doesn't work with OneDrive - or Dropbox. Mobile computing is all about cloud storage, so this a a fatal flaw. If fixed, this would be a 5 star app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is can help my job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very nice office app.Expecting Tamil language support soon....Hats off to the team.Requires mouse for many operations.It will be better if touch is enabled for move and selection tasks ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Opened doc from Drive, glitch, impossible to navigate, then crashed. Then after it consistently crashed immediately upon attempting to open any file. Uninstalled and moved on to a simple reader."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"My boyfriend recommended this for me since he used it on his other Android devices, but it's ridiculously difficult to use on a tablet. I will be uninstalling this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I am using a galaxy tab 2. The app loads up BUT when I start a new thing, it goes back up to the start page. Please fix this!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"but android version is too slow and you need biggest screen to work."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crashes on SM-T231"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its not 5 stars but its 5 billion stars ..that's my rating ... I attach a USB mouse to use with Android office ...gives me that pro feeling ..I think this is the only software which works the same as it works on desktop.... Good job ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Using the hudl 2 (not bad) you would need a mouse. Google keyboard or finger just won't navigate well enough.  None of your double space bar taps for full stop. Also in word processor the toolbar just takes most of the top of the screen, so if you have the keyboard open all you can see is a couple of lines of text.  Its like they forgot its not on a PC. I guess if you have a 10"" tablet things could be better. Disappointed coz its the best for PC.  Undeleting"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Funktioniert nicht"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Takes some getting use to, but works well, I needed adjustments."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"working somewhat, but while saving password is asking . password not necessary.so m discarding"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I'm a fan of Open Office/Libre Office, so that's the first plus, being able to edit the documents I currently share with others without having to use a Microsoft format for exchange. Google Docs are nice, but a compromise with formatting too limited and some features (such as graphs) just missing on the tablet. Again, a plus for AndrOpen Office.  Two things I noticed immediately. No Dropbox support. I'd like to have that because, ironically, Google drive doesn't integrate into the Linux desktop while Dropbox does, so Dropbox has become the exchange/sharing platform for my family. Second, the Google Drive integration is only partial. The Open dialog let me select Google Drive, but the Save As (and Save for a new document) don't.  So, add Dropbox support and I'd be really happy. Or convince Google to add Linux desktop integration support."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Maybe my tablet is too small at 10""but this program is unusable on it. I have open office on my desktop and it is great. This one will not even save my files on my personal cloud. Sorry but I cannot use it. The review  box is a better word processor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this app because it helps me a lot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I read that it was fixed. However i am not able to use accents. Instead of ""√©"", I get ""¬¥e"" is there any way to fix it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Special keyboard functions refuse to work! Swiping functions on the Samsung Galaxy keyboard is disabled, so is the predictive text! It is Incredibly glitchy but several times more workable than Libre Office for Android. The Zoom functions is messy, and some expanded pop up menus are outside the screen. I bought the Pro version, because this thing is pretty awesome. It you use Libre Office on the desktop and synched files via Dropbox, ODT compatibility won't be a problem anymore."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I create documents on a Windows Computer using Libre Office. The formatting doesn't exactly match when I open them with this app. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I am running a 16 gig four core Intel processor using Kit Kat OS so this should work???"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is very good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Not a bad port. Really nice job. Fonts and formatting tend to not match exactly, though. Better than all the other free android office programs that support odf."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"None of the AOO apps work with a Bluetooth keyboard. They all echo the typed character twice, no matter what I try to do to make it only spit out just one character per typed key. If I use the soft keyboard (very hard to use quickly!), I only see one character; but it's useless with a real BT keyboard. So sad. Anybody know of a fix out there?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"If you're trying to use this on a phone, it simply does NOT work. I upgraded to the pro version and it still won't work. You can't keep the keyboard from blocking access to tabs. I want a refund! Would rate it 0 stars if I could!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice app.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keeps getting, better and better.  Thanks ADROpenOffice developers, you add  'plus points' to 'quality of life'. Sorry I know this is a review, bbbbuuuttt , if seamless Gdrive integration was added, 'Office-suite perfection' would be a fait-complete. Anyh, u see what I did, pulled the ninesense bit  back, back relevant to the review. Google, pls can we review the reviews, and say, hmm a prize/medal? Mine r the ace-est..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Only four stars because I have to enter spell and grammar check every time I open the app -- needs to be able to save settings."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does everything a word processor should."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it! I can finally update my spreadsheet from anywhere.  Having a bit of trouble opening data base file receipts."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It worked well enough on an Asus Transformer w/keyboard dock, but does not work with bluetooth keyboards."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app, it allowed me to keep the formatting of labels for printing off phone... I haven't used it for creating any documents yet so I can't comment on the rest of the features but it looks a whole lot like open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"As Open Office has always been a great replacement for MS Office, AndrOpen Office is a great substitute on android devices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Just about impossible to use, i like open office on desktop but this one's slow, crashes constantly and the whole desktop design doesnt work on a tablet, at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Can't reopen saved files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Yet not tried, just reading a comment that mentioned about the macros and dynamic list thats why i giving 4star"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Installed this program on tablet as Word 2010 alternative for college courses. While the program worked well and would have suited my needs, it does not have the traditional fonts that are needed such as Times New Roman and Arial Black.

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"First its huge.. but that's understandable.. the problem that i have is that it looks exactly like the Windows version. No changes have been made to make it fit on the screen. When u open a menue or try and type u can't see the whole thing or the letters are so small you can't see them. Wonderful idea.. just needs huge amounts of fixing...uninstall"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is not working When i move it from phone to memory sd card. It says unable to open file. Error occured. But it is working fabulous at phone memory"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An office app that supports both macros and dynamic lists. Still haven't tried the other features, but at least this works fine on my Xperia Z. Also happy with the new Google drive support. It's large in size but worth the download. Thanks to whoever helped programming this."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I installed this application on my tablet but after 1st run it crashes and pc hanged. I tried several time but did not work. Please check and remove the bugs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Is good for open office user, but too small for mobile user. And some function not support for mobile phone... tablet base app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I seemed to work really well but occasionally it would glitch and nothing I type would go on to the doc. (usually if phone locked) So I have now removed it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Not touch friendly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Daksrap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Hard to impossible to scroll through cells on spreadsheets. useless for my purposes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Looks good and runs smoothly, but overlay icons cover buttons to change sheets, making it useless for ods files with multiple sheets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app crashes constantly and takes forever to load various documents.  It's hard to navigate as well, and difficult to jump to pages."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app is way better than other apps  i tried and I tried alot other apps I tried Kingsoft and many open office and menu more and even though I didn't try every thing I can still see that its way ahead of other apps even if it only had presentation it when be way better than other apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Database? Beta? It's not possible to create a Table. If you check mark open database for editing and also check the create tables wizard, it will crash immeadiately. The create Table function generally does not work. The program opens to Create Form by default and won't switch to Table.  After many restarts I did manage get the create Table function to work, however, you can not save the table because the buttons are not on the screen.  Using a Samsung Note 3 Tablet.    It would be great if more attention was focused on this part of the office package as there are few good CRM or PIM managers for Android.  It would be great to have a full function database that's user customizable.                                                              I had issues with inputting text in Write. I had to turn Off Predictive text and auto-capitalization, or it would not let me input or finish a sentence. Ditto for Swype.  There is a setting to Scale the App, which makes it Possible to see your work on a phones small screen. The +/- tabs also zoom the APP in and out so you can see your work. Works best holding the phone in Portrait rather Than Landscape."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like a lot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good use in android phone I liked it &i suggest all friends use this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"and advance users of phone keyboards and word procesors. It works for me in my galaxy sIII  so in a better device must be even more productive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ÿßŸÅÿ∂ŸÑ ÿßŸàŸÅŸäÿ≥ ŸÑŸÑÿßŸÜÿØÿ±ŸàŸäÿØ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crash all the time at the opening on my samsung galaxy tab S on android 4.4.2."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app just crashed during a save and I lost pages of work, so thanks for that.   EDIT: I was able to recover the work after digging through my temp files and it hasn't happened again. But, there is still a lot wrong with it. Can't download an odt file, open it, and save it. Doesn't work. Word search doesn't work. Pretty janky overall, but functional enough."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Superior application"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app seems to have the most options and details for documents on Android. It needs more font capabilities, so I can effectively edit my documents. It would be great if we could import custom fonts from other sources."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tried to use spread sheets wouldn't work. Frozen screen several times before giving up. HTC one."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"While it seemed to run ok. It is a direct port of desktop program. So bit awkward if using a small screen. And to top it off it has full screen ads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Aoo is just GREAT !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I must be doing something wrong, but it just sits there with dialogue box saying 'start  openoffice'"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Turns my HTC one into a homework machine. I love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its true"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The Best Office App for Mobile!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Loved"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"very happy open office has developed this app. I have to use my remote keyboard to enter data as the virtual one takes up to much screen. scrolling and zooming are weird (hard to get it where I want it). have to use the drop downs to change background color in cells. nothing I can't workaround but would love for the scroll/zoom to be smoother."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its too slow.... but  have a convenient way to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I loved it. It was very slow, however. Perhaps you could try making a condensed version, i.e. less features and a different interface. A very simplified, interface. Soft of like KingSoft of Microsoft."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I finally have open office for mobile and tablet, though it uses a lot of space, I can deal with that, thanks for Drive integration."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"really charming"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's still in beta so some minor bugs are more than expected, the touch interface needs some polishing and I had to install the spell check on my tablet separately. But it's still all worth it for a full port of open office. Support these guys they need it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have been using Apache Open Office in preference to Microsoft Office for years and with AndrOpenOffice  for my tablet.     Life's Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am very much satisfied with this app. I would personally recommend this application for all android users. Loved this app!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It opens Photoshop psd files too. Great! Thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best and feature rich office suite for higher end Android devices. Works well with LibreOffice files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Still uninstalled needs alot if improvement"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Start helaas niet op, ook niet na een minuut wachten. Hier kan ik helemaal niks mee."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't open on device."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Will now not work without Google Play Services. You lose every bit of phone privacy you ever had. This app is a telemarketer's dream come true for harvesting data about YOU and all your CONTACTS too! Disappointing.....now uninstalling"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As a writer I use to carry a notepad with me everywhere, but no longer. This did not work well on my phone but is nearly perfect for my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Number one app in play store. Need more ported apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Would still like a keyboard that doesn't obscure so much of the screen. Keep up the good work! Samsung Galaxy Tab 2"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"very nice but too long"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"There are a lot of negative comments about this fork yet it is at least a valiant attempt at porting Open Office to Android. I think that it works great on my tablets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have used open office stuff for years on my desktop, but this app has been a total let down.  For a start, the interface is old and clunky, not at all what I was expecting. I also had a nasty suprise when I tried to save the first document I worked on in the suit. It wouldn't save. At all. I can't find a way to fix this, and so will be unistalling the app, sorry."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Has a great interface, but is very unresponsive.  Galaxy S5"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love it, it may have its bugs but this is the first full featured office product for android and one that is free not subscription based. Keep up the good work you made my life easier with this app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Base does not open"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great. I am able to edit my word documents and spreadsheets on the go. Also, I am able to convert those files into a .pdf format on the go as well.  I tried other paid office applications. None of them works nearly as well as Andro Open Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OUTSTANDING"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just what I've been waiting for. Allows seamless transition from desktop to mobile device without changes in formatting, function or user experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the best move yet to bring a true office suite to mobile technology. Use it, suggest fixes, report errors... That will be paid back in a better Open Source office suite."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I can't download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This will be the best I am using galaxy 12.2 pro. It just like my computer desktop. I really love it. It opens many formats. The only issue is that I don't know where landscape orientation is. Please this interface is good especially for tabs like mine. Keep it up"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I download it and installed. Won't  start up properly. Won't load in files. Jams up the tablet. Just another iffy app on Play Store probably written by school boys and girls."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ratha kunthea"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I LOVE open office on my desktop. But this app was not definitely not scaled for phones... it's pretty much just the desktop version. Firstly it took forever to start up. The zoom didn't function very well; first my text was massive, the small corner of the document I could see disappeared altogether, then when I zoomed out to get it back the text was miniscule. The app lagged and made my predictive text go nuts, I couldn't even get anything typed. Sticking to the desktop version!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Can not login in Google Drive, keep crashing"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice one"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"EN IYI AMA ACIK ARA EN IYI OFIS PROGRAMI... Telefonlarda biraz zor... Ama tebletler icin 10 numara..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"so good apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Keyboard doesn't work, only numbers and symbols."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Big program.  Very nice.  But doesn't work with writing stylus on Note 3."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Not optimized for phone screens.  Still a desktop app !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Bad for arabic"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So far I used this office on daily base and I must say it works great for me. After install it I didn't need to use one on my desktop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Crashes whenever I opened a formula from Microsoft one drive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Word job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a great to for our work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"its a very helful app for coming day..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awsm"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"10.1"" screen is still too small. Good for tablets, bad for phones. All tools, fonts, colors, and fonts need to be in drop down menus to maximise the screen space."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Doesn't perform searches properly and it's impossible to use on a smartphone even with a screen as large as a Samsung s3. Even the zoom in and out doesn't work properly."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very very very nice app. Same as the pc office. Thanks for this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very nice app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A very good and worthy port of Open Office. It does everything the full program can do. However as it's not designed for the small screen it can be a bit fiddly and I wish I still had a stylus. But, it's usefulness  and functionality outweighs these difficulties and I'm just happy it's now on Android. Nice one!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No good to sensitive curser jumps all over the place"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Open office is ported but not usable on a (big) 5"" screen of a smartphone. Personally i think there's a need for a stripped down version for such small devices. Deinstalling even if its good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Some issues handling macros, but generally usable. Not sure if a crashing ads delivery engine on exiting the app bodes well..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"So glad to have open office added to my phone. It's a little pokey but for quick edits of existing odf's it worked.. Even pdf export. Nice, thx Devs"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The app is the closest to a desktop version of office, but just simply doesn't work. I tried to use it for my business, yet most cases I've had to give up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I truly recommend it! But the developers should try making it more touch-compliant, so that you won't have to travel to the scrollbars just to scroll. You should be able to touch anywhere and drag to scroll. But anyways, great app I say!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good ... nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"When ever I try to install it says Unknown code during installation *-24* PLEASE FIX I INSTALLED IT BEFORE."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Y that if I used on my s3 mini (ICS) I can delete and change text but when I used on my tablet(KitKat) I can only add text on existing docs but can change  text.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Good apps replacement for proprietary apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to keep you're stuff private..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Note3. For a phone, go into Settings and turn off Large Icons. Adjust the Scale to get the icon size optimized for your device. Adjust the Frame Rate for best response. Now I have a full office for my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best one on the market!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The port is perfect. Nice job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is great apps."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Horrible...Won't even open!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't get it to work - looking forward to update.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a great initiative as my tablets now become more or less complete with no need of having any other os. I'm now updating my review because I have seen improvements on problems I've mentioned previously. Now I have a problem with a couple of less critical characters instead. For some reason Alt Gr+2 doesn't give me @. Instead I get nothing. Then I get ? instead of / with shift+7. Those are the major ones but I can't seem to get any |'s or \'s as well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I love the idea of this, as the interface is much like  the desktop version, and the instructions for editing are thus (theoretically) consistent.  AOO also (theoretically) reads, edits, and saves the greatest variety of formats.  (Office Pro is decent, but balks at half the rtf's I offer it, and ODTs must be resaved as docs.)  However, I am running Kitkat on a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 (2014) and this AOO software is balky and sometimes outright unresponsive--I am not sure if Kitkat or the Samsung tab is the issue.  I guess I am left with Kingsoft/WPS, which functions nicely, but has an odd interface, but I may make peace with it, as it is really made for Android.  Why is it so hard for Android developers to make something that is essentially Microsoft's Wordpad and put it on an Android? I really hope OO fixes this--and they do need to make the interface somewhat more tablet-ready without making it look like it was designed by Fisher-Price."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This will be the most featured android office app. I think the icon better with smaller size."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open Office is truly awesome!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Dude, did you just port OpenOffice to Android? I think I've found my hero. A few performance hacks here and there, better cloud integration and (maybe) render it in a more up-to-date UI, and you've solved it.  5 stars anyway though because it blows every other android office suite out of the water."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It took nearly 5 minutes to load when I first downloaded it. Then it said that the app isn't responding."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The ads are intrusive and pervasive. Good for the advertisers, not good for users. But thanks for a practical, working app. Wd pay reasonable amnt to get ad free ;)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"That's a mess. Crashes often and sluggish on nexus 7 2013. Interface is same as linux. Couldn't find the uninstall button quick enough."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I was most interested in the possibility running Impress presentations on my tablet rather than a notebook but was disappointed to find that, when projected, I could not show the slides full-screen: Android icons remain visible, as do a number of editing option icons. I was also unable to use embedded hyperlinks to Writer documents - attempting to do so produced a warning screen saying that hyperlinks were disabled for security reasons. The biggest deal-breaker for me is the inability to embed video clips into slides: This version only accepts avi files and Android won't play them, even with a multi-codec video player installed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Takes forever to load, even longer to respond to a button push. I think because it is downloading adware instead of performing. I would not mind the ads, IF IT WAS USABLE in the meantime."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good. Finally an office suite for android that works. Keep it up !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ts gud"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing office suite app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks guys! I appreciate the hard work you put into this! It's great!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Its v good."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It is better from other Offices"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Raj"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I don't use this for everyday office apps. The lighter versions like WPS etc.. are better. But if I need to do some  REAL work on an office document, this is the APP for it, no others come close as far as functionality go. Nice work!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use this on two android devices and it works well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's not optimized for a touchscreen which is weird."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"full version of word and spreadsheet as on PC and other office apps better than any other android office app but is lacking in graphic quality and is not set up for phone or tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"it is useful but needs a lot of space"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice work. please add bengali language and keyboard"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"There were some things I liked. It resembled the Windows version, albeit Windows 98. But...When you try to zoom out to make the text smaller, it keeps getting smaller, and smaller, and smaller, and then it crashes. And you didn't see much of the screen, three buttons for mouse, keyboard, and monitor made visibility difficult. Your recent documents were not to be found under ""recent documents."" All in all, I'll stick to my computer for Open Office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"open office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Please fix BASE. This is a great app. Just wish base worked on my galaxy note 3.  Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's everything it is on a PC, but it's not translated to Android well."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's been a long time coming to finally get an ODF capable Office suite on Android.  The interface could use a little work, but considering it's basically the desktop program with an Android launcher.  The big issue with such a setup is difficulty dealing with the weird windows of X without window borders.  That said, to those complaining about losing data with their documents Try this... ""SAVE OFTEN!""  And to those that are having issues with Office 2013 documents. The margin defaults are obviously going to be different. Try adjusting those before complaining about this Office suite screwing up your formating.  Another suggestion for everyone. Use a keyboard and mouse, it makes things easier for me to handle."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cant cope with non US dates. Requires a very large screen. Might as well use a pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Still has a way to go especially for tiny screens. There are some bugs but it is already fabulous. Keep it up!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"How to open cloud docs?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I haven't tried this to my Acer iconia one 7 maybe this time I really have to try this..useful for my studies..keep up developers..sorry I don't have a credit card yet I love to use the pro version of this app but really not having the chance to have it..maybe some day..thanks anyway guys.. (y)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I really like the idea of a full-featured OpenOffice on android, but in it's current form, it's really buggy and unstable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"this is the best office for mobile"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"its too large for my phone it didn't download for me don't download it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Look just as pc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I'm pleased as punch that an attempt has been made to port this exceptional product onto android, but the controls are difficult to use with this product intended for use with a mouse and android being touch-screen.  I'm rooting for the developers iron out the wrinkles soon.  I'm very enthusiastic about this!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Really nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This appears to be a direct port from Windows version. Very difficult to use.  Sizes of buttons all off. No share.  No way to print."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app...  Yes its openoffice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is respectable attempt. It is actually Open Office on Android! ..... but after the excitement fades and works needs to be done, then I quickly realise that the formatting on my Office 2013 documents get messed up badly, and the  zoom-in/ zoom-out feature doesn't work properly..... am keeping it installed though, but WPS Office (Kingsoft Office) is what I use when there is serious work to be done. Thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Impressive but a bit big for tablet and does crash. Streamlined / light version please."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"When I found this I thought I'd at last be able to use a database set up in Libre out in the field. No such luck. Database seems to load, but app crashes as soon as I try to open a table or form. Pity, it would have been ideal. I'd have quite happily bought the pro version if it had worked."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work with my LG G3 mobile phone. Please help me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keep it up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"it is very  good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks very nice software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Froze every time I tried using database.  It also has ads!  No thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Impossible to use on my 4.6"" screen. Only slightly better on a 10.1"" screen.  The GUI has too much content of menus and such to navigate spreadsheets with ease.  Can't print to wireless printer (no current option).  Not able to send documents via email (does not work).   Difficult to access and open LAN networked files from the app. Not fully compatible with office 2013 documents. Documents scrolling is slow and lags on Galaxy Tab 2 10.1."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I sent a spreadsheet i created in openoffice to my phone. This app wont open it. I keep getting an error for insufficient rights. Not impressed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Yes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just love the fact that I am able work across platforms and with using dropbox everything stays in sync. Great job to the developers and I will be getting the Pro version very soon to support their outstanding work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Freedom of work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Powerful App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Professional app! Great for us writers. I recommend it for my fellows!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent app. i found all my needs for office work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I have been searching for an app like this for almost a year. I work alot with open office on my laptop being able to edit & save on android now is brilliant. This works flawlessly on my G note3 (KitKat 4.4) and I bought the Pro version just to support the developers who are doing a great service for people like me at a very reasonable price. Loses 1 star as slight issue with right lower corner menu icon covering other buttons on my device screen. But overall impressive job, thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This does offer OpenOffice functionality for Android, but not configured well for touchscreen use. The one thing it did allow me to do was save an ODT/ODF file as a Word document (so that I could edit it in a different app). When I used AndrOpen Office to edit the ODT/ODF file, I did indeed have many options, but the UI (especially selecting text) was clumsy. All the apparatus surrounding the text on a 7"" screen meant that it felt like I was looking down a long tunnel to get to the text. Also: 87MB!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Recent samsung update for some reason has my spreadsheet opening only in ""read only"" mode. This means i cant edit my mileage log because of stupid administrator privileges. Cmon guys fix this please. I see it says you recently fixed a bug that exactly is this problem well I'm here to tell you that this did not fix the bug in fact now is the only time I've ever had the bug."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Might work better on a device with a detachable keyboard, but on a regular tablet, it's a pain to simply edit word documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Dissapointed with the graphics handling in the word processor. It's the same badly implemented mess that MS Word has. To see it done properly, look at a desktop publishing program or even Pages on an iPad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Clashes with the big buttons app which I use on everything"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Getting better"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I had this app working great on my Samsung Tablet Pro 10.1.   All of a sudden I can get to the applications menu but whether I try to open a file or an application it starts to load, flashes the screen and goes right back to the applications menu.  I see there is an issue with my tablet that it isn't working but I HAD it working.  Great app but needs to be fixed for tablet.  Please fix.  PS I tried uninstalling and reinstalling but still won't work.  I am wondering if there was an upgrade which broke app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Every time I open it, I'm asked if I want to start some recovery process.  Can you please get rid of that?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's so very fantastic and all type of andropen office!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Vimal"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice to try"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great to have OpenOffice! It's a bit slow though, even on a nexus 7 and very slow on a nook color. Touch scrolling is way too fast."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The so-called ""fix"" for the read-only from SDcard bug in KitKat (version 1.5.3e) didn't fix that at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I was excited to find a ported version of AOO for my new android (Asus Padphone X, w/V4.4.2 Kit Kat)! I also installed the ""Pro"" upgrade add-on. Well My enthusiasm quickly slipped away to frustration.  While I would expect any complex app like this to have some glitches, I simply could not use this App.  No issues with installation but that's where its functionality ended.  I could not open  PDF documents (tried several, but the encoding is off and it comes up unreadable) I could not select encoding to try to correct the issue (i simply could not control the drop down menu)  I could not open Xls files and do anything with them (would display but I could not change views or enter edit mode) and the windows always displayed at the wrong size and I was unable to scroll across to see the missing half of the window) I basically had no control over the app at all! I am not sure if this is an issue with Kit Kat or with the Padphone's dynamic display functions (this phone comes with a tablet that the phone docs in and automatically adjusts to the new screen size/functions) I will try this app again latter but have little patience w/ apps that don't work without major tinkering !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Poor interface, not mobile friendly. Can't save or export."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Software using on androyed is a fabules for for ppt. ext. files"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"2003 ms office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Sumbit"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Great for tablets! Not very useful for mobile phones, it need large screen. Arabic letters in whole words appear seperated instead of aligned. Thanks developers for this free fully functioning office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good work team I was looking for this application for a long time now the ease with which I can use my xl calculators is just amazing.Thanks for this great work keep it up."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nothing else comes close. More OOo ports are welcome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Finally a what-you-see-is-what-you-get office for android! Still a bit rough around the edges, but impressively functional. Thank you so much and keep up the great work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It took forever to download then said insufficient storage."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for a travelling writer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Theres something wrong with right to left arabic support. I hope it gets fixed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great office suite, great port,  the highest pleasure"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Some people might be put off by the UI, but the program is surprisingly fluid and all the features are functional including PDF exportation, access to storage as you would expect, etc. This program is really handy when you need a bona fide office program on a mobile device without the drama."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"it used to work but now its crap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Says ""couldnt install on usb storage or sdcard"""
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"With some ui tuning this will be excellent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Lets me edit open office documents, nice lay out."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"But help is not installed, where can I get plugin for the same. Guide us? please update with Devanagari font and Hindi dictionary. I shall not hesitate to give 5 star."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Works with ods files unlike Hancom. Fixed not being able to input text bug from last version, but still unable to use swipe/gesture keyboard input using Samsung's keyboard or Swiftkey though. Works with Google's keyboard, but I'd rather use either of the other 2 keyboards since they have better layout options. I'm using Galaxy Note Pro 12.2"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The user interface is still built for a desktop computer. I can only look at it a part at a time on my tablet, and dialog boxes appear off of the screen. This might be usable when the UI has been rebuilt for mobile screens, which I hope is soon."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Would not install"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Much better :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app. The only one i found that opens xlsb files.cheers"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely nothing happened, not even a hint of the app opening. Paid money for it but still doesn't work! Is as annoying as LiberalAus!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"After update, my spreadsheets quit working.   I have been using this app on my Samsung tablet for several months and have had no problems.  Unfortunately after the update when I am typing in a cell which does not have a specific function assigned to it, my keystrokes are not recognized.  Usually they are actually coming up incorrect.  For example when I try to enter 7/1/14, I get 411//. Cell formatting does not solve issues.  If I could uninstall update I would, but not an option."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Suitable for businessman and travellers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I installed open office on my pc and really like it. I wanted to like this on my tablet Galaxy 8.0, but it wouldn't acknowledge my clipboard ; wouldn't let me name file to save; wouldn't hold format when I pasted; wouldn't let me save to sd card or without a password. App looks impressive but it's all show and no go. Perhaps they'll get it right someday."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No perfecto pero always looking forward  going to fix next"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It was like having an actual Open Office program running on my Nexus! The developers deserve a lot of kudos for this. Unfortunately it ran a little too slow for me to be able to use as my primary writing program, but already I can see it is a great start. The mouse mode is nice and allows me to actually use most of menu options I would use when using the desktop version. I will be keeping an eye on this in future!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Been looking for an app that can work with OpenOffice and this is it. Hope the devs can continue working on it to make it even better!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No functioning spell check - despite spell check keys.  You can type ""sdcsfebs"" and it won't have a problem with it.  Another junk Android word processing program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good job! Wonderful!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Installed this, opened up an ODT file from my drop box and there was Open Office running on my tablet.... Thank you devs, you have made my Asus Transformer finally fulfil my purpose for getting it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Not perfect but it is awesome that this exists and is being developed. Keep it up!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A little slow and hard to use on my small tablet... Otherwise excellent!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A real office app on my moto g. It works even better with a mouse plugged in. Please can we have the option to pay for advert free version?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is currently the best office suite for android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't open any docx files on my Galaxy S5. Also, no visible support for Dropbox. Uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"very slow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Crashes upon opening a database."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Still far from best as it work in my desktop. But  I know porting from desktpp to portable is a great job. I love it, its realy usefull instead DocToGo that I use since 2000 on my Treo. Hat up for who work to porting project. 4 star for the software for this time and 5 star for the spirit of all people who work on it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Still display Thai tonal markers wrong. But it miraculously has correct word segmentation while most Android word processor can display Thai characters but got everything about word segmentation wrong! If it can display Thai characters perfectly I would give a 5 star."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's basically the real thing.   Only on a phone is necessarily a bit wonky and breaky interface wise.   Pretty dang cool though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Pleased it is available,  but still needs work to perform as well as PC version"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Loatr"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very nice but with all the information on the screen it is hard to use on my galaxy s5 or maybe my fingers are just to big  keep up the good work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The only problem is that it is NOT optimized for small tablets."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office no fees , great free app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A bit bulky and slower to   respond on my android but works like a champion."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't update for two mounth(((( And very slowly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A f***ing office suite for my phone. Awesomeness!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"PERFECT"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Androffice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice Without infringing. Love it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app is promising, it really brings the full OpenOffice experience to Android. However, it has several problems, like 1) not remembering your customized settings to OpenOffice upon app restart; 2) the lack of proofing tools (not even your keyboard's integrated proofing will work); 3) long menus get cut off and there is no way to scroll; etc. I'm afraid this app is not quite there yet. I'll be following future updates. Congratulations to the devs on the great product they've achieved so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally I have a desktop quality office suite on my phone and tablet.  Thanks for making it available"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thx for making it available!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Uses Windows-95-esque GUI. Makes for tiny menus on phone or tablet, but no need to relearn how to use program. A+."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Need to enhance its compatibility,  specifically the UI, bigger buttons and menus bar. Scrolling needs to improve too."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"it simply has not translated into Android and is not workable on a tablet, bad scrolling, opens a fresh copy for each document and is loaded with ads which hijack your tablet when you close each document. Best avoided."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very rough need to set decimal for every cell each time you use it election drag not work very lagy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Android. No.1 office application....."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I would not have believed it. They ported over the entire suite into something I can hold in my hand. Remarkable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works for portability. Wouldn't use it to collaborate or compose. Samsung galaxy s3."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"And lives up to it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just think the name should be changed to ""OpenOffice for Android"". It rolls off the tounge alot better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you..... great application...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This one is very good I know."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"functioning well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Used to open a huge csv file, originally created with excel on my mac, anyone struggling that doesn't want - or can't afford to buy excel need not worry, this awesome tool is all you'll ever need. Well done OO!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I know that porting this is no easy task. So I give the Dev props. But, the fact that there are ADS on an Alpha/Beta Version of this app is ridiculous. ADS are for generating income, just as an app with the ""in-app purchases"" is. Look at it this way: would you pay for an app with ""in-app purchases"" if it was really buggy or wasn't fully functional yet? No, you wouldn't. Get Rid Of The ADS until this app is fully functional. But when it is done, offer ""in-app purchases"" for more features. Nobody likes ADS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's is very nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app has the most features of any office app for Android.  It works great with my Bluetooth Keyboard and S Pen on my AOSP Note II.  It's surprisingly smooth and full-featured."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Cloud needs more variety,  doesn't recognise ppt ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"But very laggy on note 2 (kitkat 4.4.2)& can't open documents on sd card (kitkat 4.4.2). Overall good:D"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally office document editing in smartphones is not a novelty or gimmick anymore. With the introduction of devices like Alcatel OneTouch, high processing power, lots of RAM, and fHD display are now within reach of everybody, and AOO runs even on mid range 2011 devices. I am using the convert to pdf option and then printing with Star Print. Adding native printing here might be too troublesome. AOO rendering is more faithful than most other office suites I have tried."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"A mobile app would be nice"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Every time I reopen a word processing file, it's in Recovery. Nexus 7."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent application for use to official work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I can use goalseek.. its very usefull.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Is this even compatible with the open source license?  Uninstalled with prejudice!  UPDATE: now has an option to pay a small amount for an ad-free version. Somewhat less offended (porting something the size of OpenOffice is a big job) ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unusable for me.  Not sure for a tablet screen.  Couldn't find a way to make it work.  Really too bad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Not quite there yet, it needs to be able to save as a Word document,  and be able to save to clouds like Skydrive."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"works suoerb for asus eeepad transformer and never has shutits self down like simular apps !!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Seems to be a decent port but it constantly crashes on my Nexus 7."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Power point must need ...............................................BIG project!!!!!!!??"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"‰ΩÜÊòØÁïåÈù¢ÂíåÈÄüÂ∫¶ËøòÂæóÂØπÂπ≥ÊùøËøõË°å‰ºòÂåñ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"nice work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Froze my tablet regularly with never ending updates, so I deleted it. Still got updates after deletion, so I had to completely format my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app would probably be great on a tablet.  Not so much on a smartphone though..not enough room on screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful in my Z Ultra, can't even complain of the interface. Literal, exact port of OpenOffice with some tweaks for touchscreen usability."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Ive  tried this app off and on for some time.  Its getting better, but still has a way to go‚Ä¶ namely macro support.  With macros enabled the app crashes.  I still wish the dev would just create an Android app,  a desktop app still feels out of place and bulky. Latest update gives a full screen ad when exiting. What a lame tactit. Be warned."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've used Open Office for years now, and I talk appreciate this awesome app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great AP works great does what it claims."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Only problem there are no printers installed so unable to print from my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent indeed but you need smart phone with higher capacity RAM & bigger screen"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great to see OO on a tablet. It needs development of the UI to make it more appropriate for touchscreen use, but the underlying functionality is great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Says it's working but won't open documents on my galaxy tab 3 pro 10.1"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I like open office in my laptop. However, that version does not belong in my phone! This will not connect with my printer apps, or share with other apps. The tools are tiny, etc, etc.  Great print to bring Oo to the phone is being missed!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"A new font end design is need. The PC GU interface does not work on tablet's and has not been considered. The efficiency of this app is bellow average. Most Android programming Development are opting to use native over Java. Java is more effective for Android and its just cut and past devs being full lazzy and using native code. Or did apple pay them to make it crap.(to make iPad look great)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Update ruined this app on my s4. Will no longer view pdf documents...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Best Android based Office suit I've found yet.  I've tried about 3 others."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keep up the good work"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is what I needed, full OpenOffice editing app! Gonna buy bluetooth mouse to get even better experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"New item shows ads, but doesn't start."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Useless on the S5 or any smartphone unless you have a tablet maybe.  I'd rather use my laptop, shame.  Hope it gets fixed!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Exceptionally poor because my hopes were so high! A screen full of a lot of cute icons is all you really get, not functionality. Manipulation of text, which is what any decent word processor is supposed to do, is almost impossible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"If you are familar with Open Office on Windows or Linux then this app is brilliant when run on a tablet, all the menus and ways of working will be familiar. However running it on a 5 inch phone screen isnt easy, there just isnt enough screen space  So really its 5 stars as a tablet app and 3 as a phone app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The UI requires pen\stylus\mouse precision to be used effectively. Made for Z Ultras, Galaxy Notes, Transformers and the like. Don't like the name though. Why not Android Open Office?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It owson"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great app,keep up the great work!!! x)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Better than microsoft office mobile!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Touch interface not good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Working better might change to work with this all the time"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"On my Zeki 8, I was forced to download from Amazon store. The AOO is a little ticklish but it works.  I can copy files from my PC (writer and calc), open, edit, save as well as create new files.  On my new Samsung Galaxy Note 8.) I was able to download from Google Play.  Figured out how to get copies of files to tablet but when I open them the keyboard is always displayed.  I can flip in and out of mouse mode.  I can display/un-display the number pad but I cannot close the keyboard - this make reading existing files almost impossible (2 lines visible in landscape - half of very few in portrait).  When I try to create a write doc it wants me to enter a password for encryption.  I cannot find a way to save a file without doing that and I don't want to encrypt my non-work, non-critical files.  I have not found any help googling around."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Goooooooooood"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Good code ported does not work always well but bad code ported results in this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Think no further. This is what you need on the Android platform... I use a Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"As other reviewers pointed out, the app is not for small screens. The dev, however, achieved a great feat by porting OpenOffice to Android. Thank you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am worried that this seems to be a lone guy's work, without any kind of support. The official page of the app is a blogspot blog. Althought the stream of updates is adecuate for the time being, a single point of failure like that in the development process is a major drawback for someone trying to take this as a serious productivity tool. Plus, the app is not open source, making things even more uncertain, should for some reason the main developer decided to kill the project.  This is a great app for using on a 10 inch tablet such as my xperia z tablet... I tried installing it on a smaller device but it is a pain to use. Especially useful if coupled with an external keyboard.  I'd like to see better multi-language support, tho. Characters like √≥ or √∫ are not inputted properly. ¬¥o, ¬¥u.  All in all, good app. I hope it turns into a company or an OSS project."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It work amazing.  It's a little touchy at time but I think that has to do more with how small the screen is."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"On a 7 inch tablet is great. On bigger tablets I am sure is even better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it alot!! Been wanting a full office application for my android. Now I have it and its free! Works great on my galaxy mega!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You guys done great job.no words to say thanks."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is not openoffice. Openoffice is open source, this one is not"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a brilliant app, I use it alot but even on a 5"" screen I'm having a tough time trying to use it as its difficult to press the buttons like for colour and font etc. But on the whole its a great app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Nice idea, doesn't work yet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Looks great but the slooow start and the unoptimized viewport is difficult to use. Too bad :("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OpenOffice for Android man what a plus."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's really uncomfortable, not easy to use, especially with a smartphone. The only reason why I downloaded it is because I needed to open a .odt"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app is really buggy, but seems to have some real potential. It is difficult to use on phones though. I would imagine it would be a much better experience on a tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Will not open any docs from the pc version.  Using newest KitKat."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is useless, unusable & has zero support. I tried it twice & both times it crashed/froze. The pc version is great but the android version is the worst app I've ever used. You can't create any documents in this app because the navigation is so awful. I can't believe they even released it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love having full linux apps run smoothly in my hand."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It's a desktop app that runs on a mobile, there's no optimisation whatsoever for touch screen or to support a different screen format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't open existing documents,  couldn't save text I wrot using AOO.  To bad I really like it in my PC."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent Tool. This"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"First launch: Instant fatal error on non-existent path. Kind of undermines one's confidence. I'll wait for another release or two and then try again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Newest update crashes my phone while updating :("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For Android!  What else can I say."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can not install.    ""File has bad manifest"" No idea what that means but that's what my phone said.  Providor: At&t     Used home Wi-Fi (app recommended)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I use this program on my pc, tried the app on my s3 mini and phone keeps shutting down, looks like it would be a useful app and I'm sure they'll sort it out, but for now gonna have to uninstall as can't even run it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It is a nice free version instead of  Microsoft Office,  but I almost didn't know it was the Open Office app because it looked nothing like the desktop icon. Get rid of the AOO icon."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Keyboard does not show when phone is in protrait orientation. Keyboard takes up all viewing space in landscape. I cant do anything. Samsung Wonder W. Please fix ASAP."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"and so this app-suite ..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"With a little powerful device, this app works like a charm. Those wanting new features from other office suits, must remember that this is a port. The goal is to get a full working office onto Android, Not to mimic features not present in the original Office Suit."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Buggy. Constantly erases what I just put in. I was able to close out all the toolbars to get a simpler interface but the erratic buggy behavior, esp. when using my spen makes this program unsuitable. It is a shame. I am a hardcore LibreOffice user and I wanted to be able to access my files on my note 8.0. Hopefully future versions will stabilize."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It has a fatal bug"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Word is not functional! WTF? I type and everything is backspaced? How do you String a sentence? Mobile version sucks!! why can't I input information to the apps? Wish I could access a template fm the Presentation feature. I paid for the Pro version and it doesn't work on my Galaxy Note 8.0 or Galaxy Note 3. Totally unacceptable. I can't open the preview or create template."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love typing. If you are not good at typing, or great, this is for you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot to those who contributed..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Slow to open, slow to react.  Libre Office needs to port their excellent version over.... yesterday, not tomorrow!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Can you port fully functional rockbox as music player app on android?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Now this is a app. This is amazing and incredible."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mantap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"There is no option to export newer versions of office documents (docx, xlsx, pptx) , just import them. Why is that?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice but oldtype."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Android open office is like a Microsoft office"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just got it...hope it works...I need it for work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps to come along for the android platform.  Speed could use a little work, but hey - it's the real deal on my Transformer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a very powerful and easy to use program.  It's the best way to be productive while traveling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this incredibly useful port.  I can finally open Excel spreadsheets with complex formulas. Six stars + 1 to grow on.  I have one question that's been driving me nuts: once I open the ""sidebar,"" I can't figure out how to close it, other than exiting and restarting.  There must be an easier way!    (Obviously the fact that I could find such an arcane question is a testament to how much I've been using your app.)  PS how do I buy ""pro"" like the previous guy said?  Same rationale as his."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best software available for Android users and totally cost FREE...!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I am a huge fan of OpenOffice. Unfortunately with this app I cannot input letters in new document or edit existing documents.  Can only type punctuation marks and numbers. Can you please have a look at this?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app gets 5 stars for bringing the best productivity suite to Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Everything looks great except for the inability to open and save files direct from Google Drive. And if you can, I guess I wasn't capable of figuring it out"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I was happy to see then I tried to use it. Doesn't work with Android. Try to type and you get zero response. Really hate when people don't bother to test their apps before uploading it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Kills that mobile office rip off."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I have open office on my pc. Unfortunately the android version doesn't understand this platform.  It still wants to use a mouse and keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Was crashing all the time with text editor...reinstalled now seems allot better..thanks so much for the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Just waiting for the check spelling options"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Please add drop box ethier way thank you  thannk you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"AndrOpen Office works well with RTF files, a format that I use often. Many other apps that I have tried either garble the contents or make it very difficult -- or impossible -- to edit the files. This alone is worth Five Stars for me!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally the dream come true now i can say my mobile really replaces my laptop.  I can create any document any time any where."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Its large, sluggish, bug ridden essentially unusable in its present state. The screen and menus are cluttered harking back to the PC/Linux versions. Avoid."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"compressed to fit in a small screen .... Tablet = 5 stars !! but Smartphone = 1 star imposible"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Very difficult to use on phones. I guess it's better if used on a tablet. Uninstalled."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Wonderful application, but I cannot write with the touch screen keyboard on my Samsung Galaxy Tab. Pls, how can I use the touchscreen keyboard to write"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I will also used all but not power full softwer"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I can't found where open the presentation!!!!!!!     :-("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I just tried o install this to my Galaxy Tab 7 ca 2010 version. And it takes ages to load. At which point it crashes back to the app choice screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Finally an app that allows you to edit and save Open Source."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Looks like a launcher running some kind of virtual machine session ? Is it based on the ""QT  for android "" or something similar? Nice idea but i can't put more than 4 stars, since it's a brutal port"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"ok"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"production I didn't expect to see, great job! Keep up the good work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Sain u"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cant save  Cant email When save wont when reopen fill always has to recover I use open office on desk computer works good just not on tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Th is app is impossible to use. Graphic interface is bigger than the screen and refuses to open documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It supports Arabic Perfectly ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"My device, called MiiPC, Mini Android Desktop Computer, supports 1920x1080 and 1280x720 mode, both mode works with this app perfectly. It gives a feeling I am using Windows or Linux computer with OpenOffice. (only bug I found is some error message on Drawing module launching)."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Last update messed up something so my blutooth keyboard acts like the shift button is stuck down. My keyboard works fine in al my other apps so I know it is not at fault. Please fix this very annoying problem. I cannot do anything in my spreadsheets with my keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For Android device 10"" with Aoo nice combination, whenever my office PC stop working just connect bt mouse &Keyboard... ... Turn my tablet into PC replacement... Combine with jfcups print...save my work as pdf...and send to printer.....very good apps... Perhaps it come with wacky icon toolbar, but for free office with very very complete function.... I said... Good job man.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It works"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"All you people out there who are pulling their hair out like me trying to find just one office app that allows you to use the same features as MS Word.....this is it! I've gone through countless apps trying to find one with similar MS Word features and, finally, found this one and it has everything I use on a daily basis for my projects! Awesome! It even looks a lot like MS Word too which was surprising for an app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The program is great. It opens 99.9% of my docs exactly as they are. The program has made many improveme.nts since I first used it. It is definitely an excellent tool for those needing office on there androids."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very useful. I've been using OO for Windows since 2005 or so, so it's good to be able to open all my files portably again. UI needs optimization for touchscreen -- Windows-like menus with keyboard shortcuts are not that convenient for this kind of device -- but I support the decision to put the functionality out there quickly and do the UI cleanup later on."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Too late for installing ...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I can't use external keyboard. When I plug keyboard in. This app was close."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"No text"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The loading times are a bit longer than I would like and there are few minor hiccups while using it, but it's a complete suite with every option you could want to be productive on the go."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fine port"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A very good app for office documents to edit and much more. A complete look of office 2003. Install it and forget others."

This is exactly what I want in a writing software, and I couldn't be more pleased.  My only irritation is getting the auto spell check to function correctly. I have a nasty habit of writing too fast, and I often need the little red line to show up and let me know when my fingers have gotten ahead of my train of thought.  Otherwise an amazingly smooth experience that is well worth the wait."

Now the program is much easier to use on the tiny tablet. Thanks again for a job very well done!  Being an Open Office user, I like this program a lot because it helps me write files in ODT format. The file fits quite seamlessly with the files I have on my desktop. However, i would like to see the menus in the program enlarged. As of now it is very difficult to see the items on the menu and being very small it is very cumbersome to use the finger to tap them. So this is my request for the next release. Thanks."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Look what Google made to a great OpenOffice application! Instead of anticipated improvements we've got.... nothing really.

Adding some gesture support (pinch to zoom especially) would really help but you can definitely get some serious work done with this app. It seems to work very well with the stylus on my note 10.1 2014 edition as well which is fantastic, adding the option for an active stylus to be the only method of using the cursor would be the icing on the cake; that way I could use gestures without confusing the cursor."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's however lacking in the options department. When it was ported it was forgotten that you don't have a mouse. The tiny tiny icons and texts that are instead of the are extremely hardnavigate. Any sliding bars lacks the same kind of attention. The responsive interface works well when just editing. But auto correction and search functionality is really not working.  But aside those annoyances it seems somewhat unstable now and then so increase the autosave tempo a little. I'll use it but I think you should be aware of the shortcomings. That said, it makes google docs and other office suits look really bad as its works that much better than those apps. Will raise the stars when they fix the intrface and spekkchecking. And able to remember its settings."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"After working with (extremely fast) tech support, this needs to be posted to alleviate frustration on smaller devices.  Understand what is provided by this tech team is incredible: FREE, open source programs comparable to MSOffice - and fully functional on all your devices.  Amazing! Now to the point - initially I thought ""how useless - I can't even see let alone access the buttons and there is no 'pinch to magnify' functionality"".  To get around this, here's the fix: To increase all visual program font sizes, BEFORE you open any of the applications (i.e., text/word processing or spreadsheet, etc.), select the ‚Äúwrench‚Äù icon at the top of the screen. Then select ‚ÄúScale‚Äù.  From there, you may select a scale size suitable to your device.  200% makes most (smaller - like phones) screens visually adaptable and useable. Enjoy - I can't wait to get more in depth with the capability of this incredible software. Last: I've experienced some crashes if I don't first shut down the page I've been using.  Strange bug but I've let the developers know.  May be an auto-save issue."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is Apache Open Office with a Windows XP emulator built in so it will run on Android. Open Office is the best word program for Windows with the one short coming being it very slow to load text files especially with graphics. Oddly it loads the same files on Android much faster.  If you want TRUE word processing power with true professional office grade functions, this is the ONLY application for Android that does it. Say what you will but the reason it's only a 4 star is the lack of touch support. Plug in a mouse and keyboard though and you might as well be sitting on your tower PC at the office or home.  As a document viewer it's a bad choice however, you can use it to convert the documents to PDF and simply use a PDF viewer so again, HOW CAN YOU COMPLAIN??? It's the best word processor with graphic support on Android, PERIOD."

I would've been perfectly fine with that though if it wasn't for the app also taking so long to load and not working too well with a touchscreen.

Kingsoft and similar apps are great, but they do lack some features that would be very useful for document editing on tablets. While the interface in AOO isn't quite as easy as these dedicated Android apps, it does have all the features of its PC counterpart (not tested them all, mind you), and what it lacks in accessibility can easily be excused due to this being a relatively early port of a programme that was designed to run on a PC.   Major things to improve, imo: 1. More touch-friendly interface; 2. Link with Dropbox, Drive, and other cloud services to more easily access these documents.  Otherwise, good start. Given a steady flow of bug fixes and touch optimisation, this may easily become the best Office software on Android (at least for tablets, if not for phones)"

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Seems that instead of actually porting the open office application, they have simply made an emulator to run it.  Kingsoft office and Oliveoffice are much much better apps for docs, and since Quickoffice was purchased by Google, it's become a contender as well for a great word processing program.  This is clumsy at best and unstable at worst.  I suppose if you need Every feature of a modern word processing program, this might be a good option, but then, it would probably be better to root your device and dual boot a Linux OS.   For me,  speed and stability are the most important factors, as well as cloud sync. I personally do most of my writing in. Txt format with Draft,  then if I need to do actual layout move to Kingsoft office,  which is the best at layout,  or quick office,  which is best for compatibility,  since it saves in a google drive/docs friendly format."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like it because it has all of the documents I wanted like spreadsheet , presentation , text , drawing , notepad and  lots more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I cannot do much with this app on my nexus 7 running kit Kat.  Crashes and stops running all the time.	I hope it will be updated to work on my tablet.  I have been waiting along time for a good OpenOffice app.  Please continue your efforts,  thanks,  R Chabot"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The app & its facilities are good but when I save it, it doesn't open in any office also does not accept cut, copy, paste commands in my cell. So what's its use if its not working all functions ? Very poor !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The soft keypad seems to be open at all times. Even when just reading a document. This uses up lots of the screen.   The keyboard on/off toggle dosent work."

"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Pls farthest latest versions. ... 5star. .*****"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Besides Microsoft Office, open office has been the best free office suite I have ever used. That being said, now that it is on android there is no reason for me to bring a laptop to my classes anymore. Yes right now the app has a few bugs to work out and some things are hard to press with your finger being so small and all. BUT that aside it works great, just like the PC version. I got a mouse and keyboard connected to my Nexus 7 and with this app it works just like my laptop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great! I love it...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A good office application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I dont usually comment on aps but this one blows all others out of the water"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Features, such as text color, printing, help are not working at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thank you for this. I give this conversion 5 stars - warts and all - for the herculean effort and decent result. This is a fantastic start and it will only improve.  Yes, there are still quite a few warts and I won't belabor those here. Keep up the good work, and if I can help in any way let me know."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Force closes when i try to open an existing document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Been waiting for this, now it's here to stay."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Should be optimized to work on smartphones"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"It was very good I was very happy I found this until now I tried to open my file it doesn't appear where I saved it, the file manager tells me that it takes 0 bytes but then I could get it through the recent files option. How can it find it and open it if ir doesn't takes a single byte!? I tried to save as and it says that I can't, tried to export it says that there is no file. This is a joke!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"excellent programme.their are things to improve"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Too big, too buggy, too slow, and can't do what I need it to. Stops and crashes. I was really looking forward to using this, , ,"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Use open on my PC,'s. Did not open on my droid. Tried install both on the HD and on the sd card...neither worked. Very disappointed. Had to uninstall.  Using 4.2.2 with Google play on tablet.  Hope you can fix.  Am a devoted open Off user."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I can't understand the high rankings for this app.  Yes, it's comprehensive, full function, and versatile. But on my 2nd gen Nexus 7, it only opens sized like a desktop. I can't zoom out or in, the text is so small it's difficult to select anything even with a stylus. Yes, I know about the scale function, but even set to the lowest (60%), it's still difficult to use. I can't see that this is even designed for a tablet, let alone a phone.  What am I missing?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"good        ·Äπ"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Super slow and unable to use it on phone tablet. I think it is meant for desktop/pc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Too much internal memory consumed . No zooming . Get up not so good . To much time to load any presentation ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The only thing I don't understand is why it doesn't appear in the searches for best android app?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Thanks to make a software"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is to express my great appreciation to the team. They have worked so hard to port the real office suite to android and this fits the needs in making our android device into great tool for business or education use"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The app is completely functional, but is fairly unfriendly on a smaller mobile device, especially those with displays under 10 inches."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"gud yr"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Hi, great product but it needs to be able to save docx and xlsx. Also needs to be able to load/save from the cloud."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a great translation from the desktop version, that is if you don't mind the desktopish feel.  Sorry, but I have to remove a star for poor integration with Swype.  (It seems to ignore Swype's attempts to auto-add spaces.)  That said, this app seems to cry out for a Bluetooth/USB keyboard and maybe a mouse as well.  I'm ordering a BT keyboard anyway and that should free up some screen space.    In terms of performance, it runs pretty well on my Tegra Note 7 (Tegra 4 chip) even on 2 (of 4) cores for battery saving.  It is a little slow to start (not terribly so), but OO is slow to start on just about any machine so that's not surprising.  This version sometimes starts faster than Libre Office on my e-350 netbook with 8GB RAM and an SSD!  Nicely done."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a very useful application. Please add Farsi or Persian language support."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great first attempt!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Such a huge fan of this app. Nice to have a FULL version of a deskop program available on my tablet. No more stripped down mobile versions. And it's free to boot!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"If the interface could be optimised for small touch screen devices (see Kingsoft for instance for a good start) and make the performance/ startup more snappy this could be one of the drivers that changes the face of tablet/ phone usage and pushes Android along the road from convenience to great everyday, every use, platform. You have a window while the big boys dither over what to do next - use it.  The weak point in the suite (that should probably be ditched for Android for the time being) is the same as OpenOffice/ LibreOffice - Base, it need a complete re-write across the versions to become accessible to a greater user-base. It amazes me no-one's thought of it (or at least put it into action) - I have the bones for that if anyone's listening.  Great work. Don't give up. You're on the brink of going down in computing history as one of those gamechangers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very useful for my jop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It does a great job of displaying the file.  Have not figured out how to scroll from side to side but will continue to work on that.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"... but usability is not very good. The interface should be adopted for mobile devices."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Perfect on an HD screen, but with FullHD, the icons are too small. Would be nice if they would also be stretched to scale."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Two stars for nice try, but still too early to use it. It's OK on tablets, but it's totaly useless on phones. You have everything on screen, plus keyboard, and you don't see what you type... Still Kingsoft Office is the best... Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Lookalike Olololololooolololo"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent. I have always loved Open Office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It crashes when I try to run macro.  If macros don't work then I will just use kingsoft office, which is much easier to use and look at"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"weebrian"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Igrenc !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Not for phones. Better on tablets"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works well, looks good, seems to be complete, which is amazing for an Android app. But be sure to save often -- Android multi-tasking sucks, and if you visit some other app, Android may close this one in the background and destroy all your changes. And the built-in recovery feature doesn't work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Still some problems to be resolved, but probably the most complete application on Android. It's surprising to see an application like this one on your mobile phone, but it means you don't need a computer anymore for your office work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Please fix performance issues"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"need a mobile phone ui rather than a keyboard ui"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Works Surprisingly Well"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This program exelent for tablet.But not ready for phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent first release"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This is a port of a full desktop office suite, and it shows. Needs work to behave more like a mobile app. Still, an impressive effort. Looking forward to further progress."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is the app what im looking for. Nice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Tested briefly, looks like a nice range of features are available. Sadly, two of my biggest requirements (opening password protected documents and saving to Cloud storage) are not currently supported, so app is of no use to me. Hopefully these will be added in later versions and then this would be the De facto office app on Android. Also, some of the buttons are very small for touch screen, perhaps add a magnified view for when something is pressed with fat fingers?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am simply amazed... Features allow you to create anything that MS Office can create.   I'll NEVER have to use a Program  again!   Great Job DEVS."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Impressive"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The best implementation of odf for Android so far, it works as an emergency editor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is great to see this kind of app available on a tablet. I love that it looks and behaves exactly like my desktop program. There is no internet access at my work locations, so this is invaluable to allow me to continue work on other projects while in a place where a traditional computer is not available. Exceeds my expectations."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great, i've been waiting for open office for android"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This would probably be perfect for a full sized tablet with a docking station. On a nexus 7, I can't imagine doing much work with this. Needs to be touch and small screen friendlier. I would be willing to give up some functionality for that. Maybe a separate keyboard would make it worthwhile for me."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Now that printing function is here in kitkat. This would be useful for people on the go like me anytime anywhere! Great work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"üò†"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love what I saw, but I must be able to edit my work and drop in in drop box to finish up on my computer. This app does not have that capability. If it ever does, I will try again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great! Now we need one for ChromeOS!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It works, but the program need a menu and toolbar that work better in a tablet or phone format device. Built-in pcl and postscript drivers, and lpr/ipp support, with bonjour would be a five star app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Needs some more pinch zoom support.  Some the menus can be kind of tiny so being able to pinch zoom in to select what you want would be nice.  Also having this be able to open files from Google Drive and edit them would be great. Especially since Google Drive has been having problems on some devices namely mainly samsung galaxy products.  This is new, so some issues are to be expected but overall it seems to be pretty nice so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"You rock dude! Been looking for open office for android for ever! It works awesome! Thanks bro!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"First fully functional word editor for android. Windows is now obsolete. ;)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"i suggest u, download this app. if u like ms word in ur plam."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I dont belive first but when I have installed this then u believe that the screen shots are real.first try then review . I think the review does not satisfy us"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nice and excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Does UI matter? Yes, yes it does."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"No exajero 80mb son una burrada"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I realy love this app. It helps me write and edit my fanfictions and it also helps me with my school work. Good app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A bit bulky and slow on my older tablet, but it works! I would suggest building in support for cloud storage like Google drive in the file --> open function, but if you go to your drive and click on a file like an ODT, it will launch AOO. This is truly brilliant and a most welcome addition to Android. Can't wait to see it evolve, but a great first step!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It really is open office running on Android! I do extensive document editing and this will be a big help with track changes and commenting functions.  The only down side is that it is not optimised for the touch interface (eg pinch zooming and touch scrolling). But simply having a desktop office package on my phone is fantastic!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is good but very big"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The app is good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Thank you it is really useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Total nightmare taking to write a few lines and afterwards the copy/paste function didn't work. Total waste of time. Here's a hint, use kingsoft office."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing app there is no substitute of this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Slow, buggy and constantly crashing on large documents. Never ever try writing a book in this app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app has a lot of potential"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"A very good start to porting a desktop app to Android. The issue is that since this is a direct port, menu function like Print are not useful on Android - but it would be good to have a solution to print directly without a separate app. I manage a number of databases, so where do I place the JDBC drivers to configure the connection. The silly prompts suggests I contact the system administrator??? The dialog boxes should be made to be more ""Android-centric"" and not just a carry over from the desktop version. A few more improvements here will help compel me to ditch all others..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open Office Rules Okay!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Amazing application I'm glade to have it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mnogo dobro i funkcionalno prilojenie ... edinstveno kato minus moje day se kaje che zarejda malko bavno, no problema moje I day e v moq televizor. Nice app!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Nothing more to say, except that a virtual trackpad would be nice sometimes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"It's a bit flakey on my note 2 but impressive nine the less. I hope the developer continues with this as with a few optimisations it would be much more usable (eg better document navigation)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a straight port of Open Office. This means that it is not optimized at all for tablets or smartphones. I imagine this would run quite well on those devices with a physical keyboard and pointing device, as well as a screen resolution of at least 1280 x 800.  On thew upside, it being a quasi straight port, it does have pretty much the same functionality as the desktop version. The novelty wears VERY quickly when you realize it is near impossible to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I want to report a bug at the Danish language the special Danish characters are bugy causing the cursor to jump to the previous position when editing with word processor."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Finally a good open document editor for the Nexus 10 tablet. Some minor formatting issues and menus are small but it works so far. Error with saving file to drop box."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open all file and more"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Does everything I expect with results that are equal to my install of LibreOffice on my Linux machines.  Great to be able to have the same functionality regardless of device.  5 stars is a gimme on this app.  I would suggest to the developers  that the softkeyboard toggle be user locateable.  It currently impedes the ability to navigate from sheet to sheet in Calc.  This is not a show-stopper, but would be helpful to address.  Bottom line, this is an excellent example of how mobile apps should be."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"To many updates. 20 to 50 mb every few days. The whole app is only about 80mb. You think you are microsoft or something. Of this keeps up uninstal!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not for phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"A disaster on a 7"" tablet - needs a proper Android interface to be usable!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Not optimised for tablets and phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use open office on the computer so i found that this app is one of the only office apps that give me the open file types i need."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Full functionality.  Now I can have my office away from the office with just my tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"App"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Updates always fail"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use OpenOffice on my other computers, so I find this app very helpful."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I like the idea that you can edit files on the move but everything seems to be squashed together. If you try to edit a spreadsheet it is a nightmare if you have to switch between sheets because you can't see the different tabs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Most powerful and complete office app available for Android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I wish it was available for tablet. Otherwise a fantastic app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Constant progress and improvements. 5 stars. It is a big tool!  Nobody else took the effort to make OO for Android. Many thanks, SG 8 NOTE"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use this on my Asus Transformer with keyboard dock, its exactly like open office on other platforms, but touch is pretty awesome."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Entered an endless loop while downloading and kept freezing, resulting in not being able to use it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is so like easy i feel like i know the controls because it has a computer like layout it's just soooo easy if you have a tablet or a mobile device this is defenatly for you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"But... I can't use base properly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Ok ."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't even open a file without it giving me an error"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good stuff!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I use Ubuntu OS and been using open office for a long time. This app made my life easier. Edit, create and email docs on the go."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Couldn't get it to run on my galaxy tab 10.1, entered an endless loop at the document select screen.  No matter what option i selected it started to load then went back to the same screen again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I was planning on using this for simple word processing and text editing on samsung galaxy s4 but the ui is impossible to see and use on a screen this size. Otherwise I like the idea and hope the ui is improved soon"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Xolo a500"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"But it's not working on stock rooted android 4.4 on my 2012 nexus 7."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like OpenOffice 3.3"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The right click menu,  if done on a object on the lower part of the screen go out from the screen ,so partly hidden behind the lower screen limit"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Interface does not scale on small high res devices, buttons are about 2x3 millimeters."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"What was a barely usable programme to begin with, kept crashing after I updated. So I have now Uninstalled it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Still has a way to go. .. UI is not touch friendly and it crashes on first use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The app crashed after under one minute of use. And I could not view the text section of my work. Not worth it at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"On s4 with 4.3 application crash."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a great office app, it has more features than most office apps in the play store and has a familiar interface. The only problem I have is its not very touch friendly, everything is very tiny and too close together. Great work on this office app!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This application doesnt work on my samsung galaxy tab 3, it just returns to the application menu everytime I attempt to run any of its applications. Sad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have now got it to work on my Toshiba Thrive. Occasional small issues, but nothing that I can't live with. It works, and I can use on the Galaxy 3, all I do is attach it to a monitor via hdmi, add a mouse and keyboard via bluetooth and I am off and racing. This is a useful tool for Android Tablets.  Cheers for the awesome work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"it needs to be full screen and it needs the UI to be a bit larger on a nexus 10. the resolution of the screen makes it SO small,,,good thing I have a stylus!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Very unhappy n satisfied. Wasn't able to resize main page. The app wouldn't load or stay very long. Kept closing out of its self. Warning, possible conditions occur if downloaded: anger, frustration, vulgar use of language, colorful 4D display of office supplies, smashing your device, yelling and minor possibilities of lose of employment (if intended use).  Rate: Wrong galaxy for these stars. -/- ( forced to give a star >:-("
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This will put Android over the top.  It's not for small screens, though. My rather extreme myopia, the Note3 screen plus a stylus makes this barely useable, treating my 5"" like 24+"". This *is* a working OpenOffice for Android as a PC replacement. I'm ever so glad to finally be ditching the two-party OS system we started with!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"All I have to do is plug in my little mouse/keyboard USB receiver into my USB-OTG cable, and my tiny little Galaxy S3 smartphone turns into a full-fledged office suite!  And it supports the Android mouse pointer just fine!  My only issue is that I can't hide the on-screen keyboard.  Pressing the little keyboard button at the bottom left does nothing at all.  Whether I have a keyboard plugged in or not, the on screen keyboard does not go away, can't be hidden, and takes up a lot of screen space."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Guess it will work if you have a high resolution phone or tablet, but in my case (samsung galaxy s2) the keyboard takes about one half of the screen and the other half is taken by the top menu of the program, so you can't se what you write. Oh almost forgot, it crashed the first three times i tried to open it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For years, I have been wishing upon wishes to have a full word processing/spreadsheet software! I am so thankful that this has arrived! And it is free! Extraordinary!  Suggestion for improvement: implement multitouch for zoom/scroll in the document itself. In the program, when I connect a touchpad to the program, i can scroll thru folders and their contents with two finger scroll but not within the document itself. Otherwise, I am completely happy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Goes back to menu  tried several times  ASUS TF 700"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The spreadsheet works like Excell.  Would be nice to be able to highlight cells then paste in formulas."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Minor problem with scandinavian letters drawn as boxes"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Could use zoom. Tool bars to small to read. Menus appear off screen, especially sub. Works well otherwise."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Developer is a hero - full office suite is ported to android. Recommended to use on tablet with mouse."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"For larger screens, this is a good choice if you want the feel of a fully-fledged word processing/office suite.  As with other virtualized/virtual-like versions (think CloudOn), the menu bar requires precise taps.  External keyboard helps with navigating the menu."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like in computer.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good office for us, thankyou"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I am extremely impressed with this piece of software. It's glitchy, uncomfortable (although one could just plug in a mouse using USB OTG), but it's proper OpenOffice and it works! Keep it up. I guess free software is the way to go. Big thanks to the devs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"WHO NEEDS COMPUTERS?N0 1"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Does not work on Moto Defy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have this on my laptop and thought it would be nice to have on my tab but no good. :( It does nothing but crashes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Application its not letting me open any source!! Please fix"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Installed this with high hopes that I'd finally be able to work entirely in ODF. Maybe it's just about workable on a larger screen but on my Nexus 7 it's pretty well unusable. There's hardly any UI adaptation for touch and many screen elements and controls just aren't visible. It's a great proof of concept - that you can reduce the open/libreoffice footprint to run on Android, but it needs an Android UI"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Tok jadi apo"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Now not working at all wasn't great in the first place"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Please follow and update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"However, I can't delete text after I've locked my screen. It makes me cut unwanted text out. The keyboard isn't perfect... Some features still need worked.  All in all though, I'm super glad I found it!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"you can work on ODF documents with cloud support and have no incompatibility issues. For example, while zoho writer opens ODT it saves only in DOC, so if you are working with Mendeley citations in open/libre office, you lose bibliographic formatting - not so with this great app. Until the excellent Kingsoft office supports ODF, this will get the job done. For Dropbox support, ""favourite"" your document so you can open it offline. When you are on the road, go to the Dropbox app, open the doc, select AOO, work on your doc, then save it. When you have internet access, go to your favourites in DB and refresh all. All your modifications are available in the desktop - NO INCOMPATABILITY. Who cares about clunky, this saves tons of time flipping between formats! If you NEED seamless ODF, this is it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Navigating it is difficult since you are going from a program that normally uses a mouse to a touchscreen, I feel like if you add a trackpad much like the Puffin browser this would solve a lot of the UI concerns."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"really excited to see this available for android. I love the PC version."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's obviously a thing for big screens, the bigger - the better, because it is not an Open Office special version for Android, but it's almost a full desktop version with its default interface, which works on a mobile device. My 5.55"" Galaxy Note ll screen is obviously too small for the app, though it's possible to work there on it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"the only REAL office app on android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I can understand how the user interface may be a bit clunky on touch screen and smaller devices, but it's fantastic on my Asus Transformer TF101. Makes it feel like a proper Android laptop and not just a device for throwing birds at pigs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works on both my Archos tablets (G9 10.1 & Titanium 70b). I use it on my desktop PC as well, so documents easily shared. A little fussy about where my fingers are touching (but that's my screen size) and really needs a qwerty keyboard attached. Haven't done a really intensive test or I'd have given it 5*. Mike"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Intalled on my galaxy tab 3 but it crashes immediately on startup.  Reinstalling didn't help.  Want this to work - will wait for an update."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Works well, but the UI is barely usable on a tablet, and worse on a phone. I look forward to see how it develops"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Even though this software is not so optimised for small touchscreens it works best for tablets with keyboard and mouse. I use droidmote along with this app and it works perfectly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Clunky. Doesn't fit well on a phone screen. Crashes a lot. Needs more development I guess."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This latest update made typing within the application so slow and laggy.  What happened??"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Been waiting for a port of a fully fledged open source office suite on Android, without the need to use Ubuntu in a local VNC session, absolute top notch."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I had this suite on my windows based notebook, the sofetware work beautifully, I was disapointed that it was not availble for android. . . . . But. . . . Tada, here it is!!! Ooking forwad to see how it performs on my tab3. . . . Will keep you posted. I only gave it a three star rating because I'm I use it on my notebook, and if it performs as well as it does there, it will get get a definate six-out-six."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unknown core during install!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It needs Some work on the tuch screen frontire like 2 finger jesters and zoom in and out,  in mathe you cant clice the small square that makes auto calculation. Bat in all withe a mous my tublet feeals like a pc. (In a good way). :-)  5 stats for effort!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Tried every other office suite but none is upto the mark. Although this app also lacks the smoothness we enjoy on desktop and some other features as mentioned in other reviews, still it manages to be a top notch. I was dying to have something of this kind on my galaxy tab. Great effort devs.  Now all we want is regular updates so that this app will serve us more than a desktop experience."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"From the looks of it, this is open office for android. I have a Mac desktop computer and open office is great there. But it doesn't seem to do so well on my droid maxx. My phone keyboard (Google keyboard?) Is only semi-functional and screen touches don't always activate the tool bar menus. It looks great, but it seems a little too oriented toward the desktop setting where you have an external keyboard and mouse... Can there be a phone app version of open office? Sadly this doesn't seem to be it yet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Updated latest on my Huawei P6 - works fine, then updated my Samsung Tab 3 - the display angles at 45deg and becomes unreadable - the previous version displayed ok - where can I down load the previous version until this one gets fixed"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like it very much and appreciate the efforts of the developer . Possible to let the email feature work. Also when coppied  to paste it into an other application. Would be nice if the horizontal ruler can be inserted. Also the option context menu in tools menu. Thank you for your efforts.   Works nice on my Samsung note 10.1"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"CANT MOVE ACROSS THE SCREEN ON DIALOGUE BOXES, NOW I'VE LOST ALL MY WORK, GALAXY S2"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"N/A"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Thought it was useful and downloaded. App crash before start using it...and I am using note 3. UNINSTALL"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This is literally a port. It looks and functions exactly as the desktop version, which not usable on my tablet.  I barely managed to open a document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I was really hoping that this would be an leader in the open document format into android--unfortunately it is a monumental failure.  Numerous layout issues, many of which are cited elsewhere, are primarily due to a simple overlay of the desktop interface onto the android system.  While I dislike things on traditional (GUI) interface being reformated to fit touch-scrren logistics, the failure to shift traditional formatting to touch-scrren is sometimes even worse; this is a prime example.  Buttons are difficult to get to, due to their overlay; the application doesn't scroll in any time-saving fashion, and thusly proves clunkier than even the windows interfaces; and the format fidelity (already an issue in open document format) seems to have eroded even further.  I know the development of this is early, and as such I will possibly try it again in the future.  However, I don't hold much promise for this specific Open Document app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Now that i have to pay to use Adobe Reader I'm gonna start using this!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"This app needs work when I try to save any changes it crashes when making A new database it crashes. I get this is a port and will take time to perfect but please try and fix the errors"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Great apart from a few flaws. Zoom button in lower right corner overrides left-right slidebar making it not possible to pan the documents. Key button overrides arrows to navigate the sheets. Samsung Galaxy s3"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Keren ini aplikasi sangat membantu  Thank u"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"So bad"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Good"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I still use Kingsoft's Office more since it is simpler. This however is the first full fledged office on any phone platform. I use a Galaxy Note 3 and it works great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I like what I see so far. A few complaints, primarily no mechanism to save files to the cloud. I need that for file sharing. But, that may be in the offing, who knows."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Some major issues though....  esp in terms of formatting.  Seems there are problems with things like line spacing when using bullets. Means the formatting differs from PC versions of OO.  Presume that it will get better.  The ads are a pain."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I am impressed at what this looked like it could do on a bigger tablet than my phone. It is not yet ready for small phones though. The swipe gestures do not seem to do the right thing, and menu options are not reachable if they go off the bottom of the screen."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Hoping to use for school."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Bagus banget deh utk ukuran gratis thx."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This app really rocks, I can even use the files written in my home PC in Writer and Calc, and they both work well,  weather I'm using my  Galaxy Tab 10""1 or my home PC; besides that, I'm using a cheap $25.00 BlueTooth keyboard that I bought at a popular dept. Store, just to have the advantage of a keyboard and I can not complain; I still can't believe how good this app is, thank you to the folks at AndrOpen Office. God bless you."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"But free. Thank you"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unusable calc"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Open office deliveers a more rich experience than tthe microsoft app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is a little tough to work with on a small screen.  Some info doesn't seem to fit.  Hey, it's free and they seem to be making improvements."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Only app that opened xls docs properly for my charts excellent app and thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Very glad I found this, hoping development continues as the port seems incomplete. I prefer open document formats and this is the only app that allows me to edit them instead of just read them, which is great, because what's the point of only being able to read a file but not edit it?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The header menu is much too small for even my dainty girly fingers, I can't imagine it's easier for anyone else. A stylus would help with aiming I'm sure. If any improvement is able to be made on this app, I would put making the myriad of clickable icons at least a fraction larger at the very top of that to do list. On a 7in tablet they are difficult, this app's clickable menu is probably better suited to a 10in tablet or larger. It runs fine otherwise."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"If you market it as an open source, I don't expect ads. Don't market it as such if you want to make money.  And about the actual app... No touch scroll/zoom. Overlay buttons on the screen instead. This is, basically, not made for android, it's made for a computer with mouse & keyboard."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Bad.my download data was wasted"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Love the app! I've used OO on my pc for years and was thrilled to find it for android. Other apps just don't measure up. I would give 5 stars but there are a few issues that need improvement. The page tabs at bottom in the spreedsheets are too small and I actually can't access them as there is a keyboard shortcut called 'key' in the bottom left corner that covers the back/forward buttons. Really need this resolved in order to use the program. Thanks for all the work!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"downloads and sets up, but then sticks and crashes leaving a black unsuable screen which I cant get out of, had to uninstall, perhaps will work when I upgrade to newer tablet soon I hope so !"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I open it n it closes it immediately  This sux"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great work was done here!! Thanks!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Wow, now I can create, view, edit, and print it as PDF. Then print it letter, or print by using cloud system."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I love this type app. Thanks"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This is a great conversion, (best used with mouse and keyboard) finally full office on the go.  Edit: five stars now for allowing custom fonts."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app looks great.  It's performance is substandard however.  Here are problems I encountered:  1. Could ""Send"" my document via email.  When I choose send nothing happens.   2.  Copy function does not work in other apps.  So because I could not ""Send"" my document, I tried to copy and paste what I had written into an email.  While I can copy and paste into the AndrOpen app, I cannot paste into any other app - like email.     3.  Failing Send and copy and paste, I tried to open the file I had created on my laptop by hooking my Nexus 7 up via USB.  None of the files I created (and I saved the file I had written as a doc, an odc and a pdf) appears to be discernible by Windows 7.  I can see the files using a file bowser on my Nexus 7, but they do not appear anywhere I can see via USB in Windows 7.  Even a Search for the file name did not provide results.   So I have to resort to rewriting my file from scratch on my laptop.  Bah humbug to AndrOpen Office.    Aside from these issues, I found it hard to choose icons - too small for the finger to pinpoint (and no instant magnification dialog box as in other Android apps), difficult to scroll, slow to respond, etc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I just get a message: unable to install on sd card or usb storage. And yes i got plenty of space"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"But it will need some more optimization for small tablets and phones."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It passed that I think, It   could open my thesis with almost 200 pages without problems and its interface is same to pc libreoffice."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Wrote the header then tried to save and refused to save, rebooted tablet tried to recover which it said was successful and it sat there doing nothing, uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Œ©œÅŒ±ŒØŒø! ŒîŒµ Œ¥ŒøœÖŒªŒµœçŒµŒπ Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ¨ Œ±ŒΩ Œ∑ Œ≥ŒªœéœÉœÉŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ œÉœÖœÉŒ∫ŒµœÖŒÆœÇ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ ŒµŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ œåŒºœâœÇ -œÑŒ± ŒºŒµŒΩŒøœç Œ≤Œ≥Œ¨Œ∂ŒøœÖŒΩ Œ∫ŒøœÖœÑŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I really love this app! The startup interface is very simple, however don't let this stop you! This is the best office app out there! I for myself am a LibreOffice user, and this is the equivalent for android, you may find the buttons a little hard to use in the start, but soon you get used. Very nice work developer :D, I was waiting for this for months!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very fast, very efficient, a bit slow when starting up, but will easily forgive with the amount of features it packs."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Well i could not use it since it only viewed the apps pages in a angle. This was on a nexus 7 tablet.. 10-25-13 response to your response. I sent email to u directly to show issue. Still broken"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"...on my phone everything is a bit small. I recommend using Hackers Keyboard with this, so you can use the shortcuts (like ALT-f to open the file menu) instead of trying to click it. My fingers are simply too big to accurately click the menu. I guess on a big tablet with a higher resolution this is not an issue.  As for functionality, I'm glad there finally is a port of OO so I can open my ODT documents on my phone and do corrections on them without starting up my PC, and that's working without a problem."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"An error message appear when trying to save my work without saving my work. also it requests to enter a password for the file, which I cannot avoid. Update:- the bug for not saving on external SD card was fixed for my device Inar in the last update of the program. The program read and write Arabic language perfectly, although it is not written in the supported languages. I would like thank the developers of this great program and appreciate their help, wishing them best of luck. This program deserve the five stars completely. It is the best office on android system, after trying several office products."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"WWW we WWW tat ta TT w"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Will be watching it for updates. 800x600 is to small for this to work well. Possible probably but not good enough. Instead, current pinchout pinch in, should be just zoom, so you can acctually se all pop boxes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its like desktop (linux) emulator apps, perfect only for tablet 7' or bigger screen + keyboard Not recomended for small screen gadget"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Basically unusable on a galaxy S2x. Consumes too many resources. UI is unclear."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I have tried to both open an existing file and create a new file.  Neither work on my phone."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A full, complete, desktop office suite, modified with an Android frontend? And, it all runs on my tablet?!? I SAY YES!!! COUNT ME IN!!! XD"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"some of the letters are changed into unreadable script, the video doesn't play, transitions don't function properly, the animation does half a job, and it is slow to respond. i would like to use this app but i am unable to as of now. if these issues were able to be corrected i would like it better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Half way through doing a piece of work it decides that its going to crash. I save after every paragraph but it don't save it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Difficult but works"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Update: New uptade is including scrollable interface dialogues.. Thanks.   I'm having difficulty using the interface. 80% zoom out is not enough most of the time. Other than that it's awesome being able to use a full featured office suite without certain limitations'  Thank You for this excellent app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I like it that it works but it suits wide screens only, things are too squeezed together, i wish some displays would be in a drop down menus, so that what is selected is what shows on the main display."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"A simply wonderful port of OO to Android. Yes, some features aren't working correctly, but i really like the fact it hasn't been 'optimised' for tablet use; rather it's just the simple functional OO/libreoffice we're all used to. There are some obvious tweaks the developer might like to consider: on my 7 inch screen some of the dialogue boxes (options etc.) disappear off the edge, there needs to some way of navigating these boxes.  Please don't change to big fat touch screen buttons, the layout is perfect as it is. many thanks!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Absolutely maddening."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"great product!  5 stars if it had spell check!!  Using on ASUS Transformer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very easy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Please make it support thai language. I really love this app, but need to use thai language too!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Using edit > find/replace: starts with useless parameters, like ""match case."". But even when all check marks are removed it doesn't find a text string."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Since I use LibreaOffice this integrates perfectly. My only wish there was a quicker way to get to the end of a document."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Will rate 5 star if could configure cloud print as printer."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Great program and works but the layout and buttons do not fit on screen on both my note2 and nexus tablet"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"While most people is trying to optimize interfaces for a ""touch-friendly"" useless experience, here we are presented with a serious production tool. I have a Galaxy Note 10.1, the stylus works great to select and interact with the program.  This brings closer using an android tablet as a laptop replacement.  Get a bluetooth keyboard+mouse and you are good to go, complete serious work done. Being a linux user, the docs I edit in libreoffice are totally compatible here. So truly integration is achieved.  Thanks for this port, don't bother trying to make it touch friendly, its good the way it it is."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Couldn't even open any documents. Do not download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Something happens where my tablet doesn't think it's installed.  Was fine for a while now not so much"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I'm going to amend my previous review. This only seems to work on files that were created with OO. The buttons are small and hard to access and like regular OO the larger the file, the more sluggish it is; which I one thing of a pain when you get into several hundred page files. So while it isn't complete crap, it's not something to rave about."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works really well on a tablet. I love to see this. I'm hoping we can get more apps from the dev in similar style. I love how it looks. Excited for updates. Like removing ads. Thanks dev!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Gave 4 stars only because its still in development anf needs some UI tweeks... Otherwise its the best one, always my first recommendation for others.."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"First and foremost, I'd like to praise the developers. This app not only brings desktop office functionality to smart phones and tablets, but the overall experience is smooth, stable and pleasant. Hats off to the developers. I'm really glad I came across this app. I'm also surprised that it's free -- I wouldn't be surprised if this app had a price of $10."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I only need it for small changes to fairly simple spread sheets but it saves carrying a laptop"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fantastic! This is the full OpenOffice on your tablet or phone. Using on my Nexus 7 and it works as if I was on a PC. I'd definitely recommend a mouse as the toolbar buttons are too small for touch. I'm using a Bluetooth keyboard too and I haven't tried making a document without it. No cloud features; it saves onto your tablet/phone memory and you'd have to copy it elsewhere. Exports as PDF though. Loses 1 star as it tends to crash when I jump to another application. Has a good recovery so I don't lose the document though."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Slow and incredibly unconfotrable to use!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"But once it does, very feature rich. Tabs and Tools rather small, but not unusable. Running on Droid RAZR Max, ver. 4.1.1."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"FINALLY! Hope it does all it says it does. Document navigation needs some work (can't swipe/pinch) and froze up on a document opening. I appreciate how it tries to emulate desktop version. Take that Microsoft! (HTC EVO 3D)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Works very well. I use OO on my PC, so it was great to see the screen looking pretty much the same in this Android version as it is on the PC. Admittedly, it looks like a very busy screen on my Samsung Tab 2 7"", but at least I know where everything is and it works pretty much the same way as well.  Kudos for a great rendition of OpenOffice!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Excellent port"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Thats really what i need exactuly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Nice little app which is probably ok for users who just want to use writer or something but I found it fundamentally flawed when trying to open base files. It simply wouldn't open them and crashed back to the introductory screen.  It also has some fundamental issues with dialog boxes, clearly designed for computer monitors, not fitting entirely on the 7"" screen of my tablet. This makes it difficult to navigate and the author should seriously consider heavily redesigning the dialog boxes if at all possible.  I'm glad this project exists and hopes the author continues working on it, but it needs some refinement before I'll download it again."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"OK, porting OpenOffice to Android sounds like a great idea, but this is not really ported. It is barely compiled for Android, with no interface improvements and a couple of advertisements pasted over. It also crashed Google play services after a couple of minutes.. this app is just a beta and should be clearly marked as such.  I also note that this app is NOT endorsed by the Apache OpenOffice foundation."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It crashed on my Toshiba Android but at least it allowed me to recover the document.  To be safe don't forget to save your progress."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great on ASUS TF 700 Android Tablet."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Spreadsheet hangs frequently for 1/2 minute or more before accepting the input fully. Looks like it has too much overhead for an Android tablet. Maybe the next version will be worth using."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"All use this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Instead of using pinching, this app uses a broken set of arrows and double arrows that sometimes do something, other times not.  Try exporting a file to pdf and the file save box is cut off on both sides and can't be scrolled or zoomed so you can't choose where to save your file.  This app is not ready for release."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Pretty much useless on my Asus Transformer Prime II. Text document crashes after about a minute of use for no apparent reason, making the app totally useless for anything other than to take up space. Uninstalling."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"5 stars for it contains all you need...limitations are that of android os...liitle bit of customization needed..but still I finally got what I wanted"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its good apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app is the one to watch. It's not there yet but if development continues I know it will be the best word processor on Android or ANY mobile platform. Keep up the good work guys."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Awesome job for the Dev, I think this is great! One problem though, doing insert->object->formula in Writer gives an error. I'd like to use this to take notes in math class but I guess that will have to wait until the formula embedding is fixed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Pretty demanding and trouble saving simply. Love it. Although I had to uninstall.  I just wanted to view odt files. Maybe afi had a full featured work station."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It does not open on my apple tab"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Can't resize window or move it to access buttons. 7""tablet may be the problem. Any suggestions?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I love the idea of this app. Having experimented with it for the last half hour I've come to two conclusions. THIS is the app I was looking for to write and take notes. And...it needs lots of work. Things such as printer dialogs are supposedly in French. However, it appears that the dialogs are actually in some form of computer code which just generates gibberish on my screen. Once this coding is fixed so the dialog boxes display and respond properly and once I can get a version in English, I'll be happy."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"When using with my bluetooth keyboard I get double letters unless I leave the on screen keyboard visible. It would be great if this could be fixed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously slow, corrupted my files before ever even opening them properly"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This is a waste of time. I lost some serious work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cannot be used on nexus 7, screen isn't big enough to support it. No way of moving the screen around and once the keyboard is minimised no obvious way of getting it back."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"The input from the keyboard isn't recognised as standard text so the keyboard doesn't do things like auto space or display word options. Not quite sure what input type the document is, but that needs to be fixed."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This would be great on a tablet but too hard to work with on my S2"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I have used open office for many years on my pc, now on my phone as well. It's always free to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's quite slow to open program."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"IN the last version, alternate keyboards were too laggy to use. This version has fixed that.  It's still not perfect, but it's much more useful than it was before."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This app handles Office docs like no other.  I can edit XL sheets, resize and take a screen shot as easily as on my desktop.  However, the menus often don't respond and I have to quit and restart when things stop working. It also crashes but I can recover the doc."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"finally a what i see  is what I get editor in OpenOffice style.. OK :-)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mmay"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This app is great star for office app.. it offers complate function.. but it would be greater if PIVOT TABLE FUNCTION RUN WELL"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This program seems useful, being one of the more comprehensive office suites available for a mobile device.  Unfortunately, the moment you really commit to using it, it will suddenly be unable to access your word file that you pored a great deal of time and effort into.  If you saved a backup copy of the file elsewhere, that was smart, unfortunately you won't be able to open that backup copy either, due to a strange file error that will appear.  Only use this program if you don't care about your documents."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"i Have crashes opening forms in base. Please , fix that and i give you 5 stars.  This is an excelent proyect, make  a paid key for removing ads, i will buy it, and all my partners.  keep going."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Try to load an OpenOffice document and it starts loading then just quits and says 'end openoffice'.  Document never loads."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"A LOT of menu options do not work. I cannot paste anything into this program. It is difficult to navigate and often does not fit on the screen properly. It's a pain to use and there are better programs out there. (Nexus 7)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"needs mobile optimized interface.  but it is useful as is."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"This is a great start.  It's exciting to finally see an android Oo. This is not all that tablet friendly; it really is desktop on tablet, but it does do Openoffice and that's great.   The weak link seem to be draw, which I use a lot. It's hard to use on my Galaxy Note 10.1. Grabbing those corners and other adjusters is not so easy.   This may however be the most powerful spreadsheet on android. It does graphs and appears to run all the standard functions from the desktop.  I hope there's a strong dev group behind this project.  I've only spent half an hour with it at this point"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"The program doesn't work on my Motorola Photon. Downloaded and installed fine. Upon running the program, the menu loads, but when trying to start/open any document/type, I get the ""starting open office"" loading dialog which gets to about 66% before booting me right back to the main menu or out of the program if trying to open a file externally. Already tried a complete uninstall/reinstall and a reboot. Same results."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Menu not in English,  a few rectangles are shown.  On my other android devices,  I don't have this problem.	."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I use this on my google nexus 7 1st gen .The fact that i can't just swipe up and down to move thought a document is really annoying makes me feel like i'm using a computer. Is there a way to change this setting? I will really appreciate it"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Doesn't work for me, text documents display freakishly huge.  Spreadsheetd and all buttons are question marks, but, spreadsheets are appropriately sized and zoomable...in/out.  Massive kudos for getting thid far with limited support!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"About an hour of fooling around, and everything I normally use works just fine.  I'm testing on an HP Slatebook x2. I don't know how well this works without a keyboard or a full 1080p display.  I also tried this on my Nexus 7. I can only recommend it with a keyboard and a full size screen. The virtual keyboard is sluggish with this app on the Nexus 7 and the menus are too small to select on a 7 inch screen.  On the slatebook it is great."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Downloads ok, but eish when it comes to opening and editing a document, that's another story. Got so fed up with it hanging, crashing, and taking a 'week' to open the document, that I uninstaled it. Shame, because it looks as though it could be a sound application. Trying to use it on a Sansui lifepad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Its good for me"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It really is Open Office.  Use this!!!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"OOo was the only thing on my tablet that I was missing from my laptop.  Now I have it.  No issues on my Nexus 10"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Cheers to the dev for porting this to android :) running great on note 2, best full function office app, please don't include ads in any future versions id be devastated :p happy to support a donate version, thanks again dev, gimp next? EDIT! NOW WITH ADS! Uninstalled"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Realistically, this has to be a tablet only package - but that is probably true of any real office apps. Phone screen is not large enough.  Love the idea of a port of open office to Android, and nice job on getting it this far. But for me on Nexus 7, has stability issues that make it unusable for now. Only takes a couple of crashes/lost docs before I give up. Will definitely keep an eye on it and hoping that it reaches the point I can use it and improve my rating!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app it's just like having m-office on your phone.  I use spread sheets alot and it gives me full use formulas and all!  Works great no lag or force close on Galaxy Note 2!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Super, but hope that version for 5 inch tablets will be available soon...	It seems to be for larger tablets..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not usable. Good try"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Thanks for fixing the ctrl keyboard shortcuts so quickly! with the keyboard dock my tablet is almost fully functional for text editing.  But I noticed other bugs related to drop-down menus: 1. shortcuts like alt-f to access the menu don't work. 2. pressing alt brings you to the menu toolbar, but there is no way to get back to editing the document. all key presses are caught by the menus  another general comment: startup is slow, but this is probably due to my old tablet (asus TF101) also spell checking is missing."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is the closest app to microsoft office that i have seen! good job!   but does the ""auto correct while typing"" function work? because i can't seem to get it working on my tablet..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Didn't expect this. It's actually the, almost, entire OpenOffice suite crammed in to Android. Not optimal for phones of course, but works great on my Thinkpad tablet :) Ambitious and impressive! If you rate this free innovative project less than 3 stars you are evil."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"best"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"Even with my stylus I keep 'missing' I'm trying to hit.  Too much is going on on the screen at once. Worse, it keeps opening documents as read only."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I was able to use previous version perfectly but as I updated all the letters in this app shows boxes.there is no option for language also ,so that I could change the language"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"–ó–∞–¥—É–º–∫–∞ –∏–¥–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è, –∏ —Ç–∞–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –Ω—É–∂–Ω–∞. –ñ–µ–ª–∞—é —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫–∞–º –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∞—Ç—å –≤ —Ç–æ–º –∂–µ –¥—É—Ö–µ, –∏ —Ç–æ–≥–¥–∞ —ç—Ç–æ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Å–∞–º—ã–π –º–æ—â–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–æ–≤—ã–π –ø—Ä–æ—Ü–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä. –ù–æ, –∫ —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é, –ø–æ–∫–∞ —Å–ª–∏—à–∫–æ–º –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–∞–≥–æ–≤ –∏ –ª–∞–≥–æ–≤."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"I think this is an awesome start to this app. It definitely needs some work though. For example I have tried speech to text as a test and it doubles up the words. For example if I say ""How are you?"" it shows up as ""How are you? How are you?"" Second, I have had numerous errors trying to save documents no matter how I try to save it in the default format. Switching to .doc solved this and minor but still...to be noted to the developer. Third, none of the help files or support items in the help menu work. And lastly, agreeing with other reviews, the interface while absolutely awesome is so small on even my 7"" Nexus tablet that it makes tapping on things like the justification, bold/italics etc formatting options to list a few, a real pain to tap. They're just too small and I don't have big fingers. With some modifications and tweaks, I'd rate 5 star, but as a heavy user for work notes and a backpacking journal user, I'd like to see modifications first to make this even better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Mantap... tapi susah downloadnya...."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It is the full blown open office with all its bells and whistles on the android. No trimmed set of features. Everything works flawlessly on my nexus 7. Works beautifully with touch. The best office suite for tablets. This one rocks. Download and have fun. I just wish I had a 10 inch tab. But don't get me wrong, it accommodates beautifully on the 7 inch screen of my nexus. Thanks Dev :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"The best looking office suite. Looks like the desktop version.  good job"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I saw this and went berzerk to down load it as I am an avid Open Office user on my pc and I have been languishing in pure frustration at trying to find a full, mobile office suit software app. Unfortunately, the app is a little too much like the Pc and is too small on my Galaxy S3, and probably even tablets, to be useful. More than 90% of the app (the spreadsheet mainly) is so small, you can't get to the buttons needed properly. Please dont giveup OP! U r headed in right direction, just needs work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Frist of all , I wanna say it ia the best office program I have ever seen . It needs to fix some bugs . And needs to support mare languages especially arabic. And more stability . But its features are pretty awesome and very useful.  I will describe this app in one phrase ( not like others )"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Not usable on mobile devices, UI is for desktops."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I like this apps"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It works great on the PC but the Android implementation is horrible. No way to pinch zoom to make it readable. It crashes for no apparent reason, unable to switch apps, does not close properly. Not ready at all. Too bad."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It is not working in my tab always says error"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It can install in my android tablet ..but if.It work. I give u a rate of5. Star$"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"It's nice to have a real working wordprocessor on android, the spreadsheet and presentation package look promising - and draw in especially nice on a Galaxy Note 10.1 with the stylus. I couldn't initialise a database - not surprisingly. Seriously looking forward to the next release. NB - don't even think of running it on less than a 10"" screen!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"This application is just what I've been looking for! The service from andropenoffice is fantastic, they fix bugs so quickly and reply to your enquiries. I highly recommend this application."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",2,"I had great hopes for AndrOpen Office; unfortunately it seems to be unusable on my tablet (Ainol Venus, Android 4.1). All of the characters in the menu bars and all of the menus are little rectangles, so I assume they use a font that's not on my tablet. I have not had this problem with any other apps (including several office-like apps), so I assume it is not an unfixable problem. As it stands, however, the app is unusable. (FWIW, my documents display just fine.)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Cannot update as the package file is invalid"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"This is a terrific full office suite running on my Android tablet!  I realise that as a port from a desktop program its interface is not ideal for touch devices, but with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse it's wonderful and almost complete.  I can load and edit docx files, complicated drawings, and spreadsheets.  Great!  I realise the developer is probably being tugged in two different directions: by those that want it to be more touch-friendly, and people like me that want it to be the full desktop experience on their Android tablet.  Hopefully the dev can do both!  Keep up the great work!  Things not working: Spell checker, Find, mouse wheel scrolling, right-click context menues (instead need to hold down left button).  Bugs: Saving docx files doesn't work, only doc or odt (docx is selectable but ""bounces"" back to odt on save).  Password check box is enabled by default on save dialogs (annoying).  Things I'd like: the option to turn off touch-friendly overlays and file requesters, instead using the desktop interface only.  Any chance middle mouse button drag etc can be made to work?"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"All of the pieces for greatness are there (mostly since they were already made and just got a port lol) but the buttons are painfully small. If this app were to recieve support for a full android application transformation, I would rate it 5 stars"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't load its modules, won't open od* files, crashes constantly. Yikes."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"For those using OpenOffice or LibreOffice, this looks like <the> app that gives you 97%+ of the functionality on the Desktops, supporting all open formats. Only minor bugs (very minor) related to display orientation which of course aren't issues on Desktop displays found so far."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Trying to download on HTC evo, plenty of space on hd and sdcard, but get error, unable to install...why? Would love to use this app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"thanks for the app"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Like."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"I've been looking high and low for a full-featured office suite for my tablet. This will do the trick perfectly! Sure, it still needs work. I'd love cloud saving ability and a slightly more optimized interface/ more keyboard shortcuts, but overall it's amazing.  If it ever went pro, with few or no bugs and more features, I'd have no problem shelving out $15 for it. Tablets NEED this kind of thing. With an hdmi cable and tv, otg cable/powered hub, mouse, and keyboard I might as well be on my desktop."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am very impressed with this version of the word-processing package which is certainly very useful and will become my default of complex documents that need editing while I travel. One bug I have noticed so far is that I cannot get Find or Search and Replace to work with Open Office on my Galaxy Note 10.1. Help files also did not load - which makes sense to save space - but I cannot find a developer's website to consult or to flag bugs too. Maybe I just have to explore more. Any tips on these points would be welcome"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Great app for students like me. :)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Hiiiii"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Won't let me use properly help? Its got a half side view angle .. Not sure how to get to settings ..all in all not happy"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"The expected troubles with dialog boxes not scaling properly to portrait/ landscape settings. Can't find the configuration options so-far (mm, not in ; EN_UK not EN_US), but certainly a big step forward. With this, I could be persuaded to a slightly larger tablet. It won't REPLACE my laptop, but it makes the tablet MUCH more useful.  (I do use an add-on keyboard, but that is a comment on on-screen keyboards in general. They were crap on my Psion's touch-screen, and haven't improved in the decade since.)"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"It's a desktop like office app. Highly recommended especially for those who don't have PCs or laptops but have tablets or smart phones because of its rich features allows you to do what you could have done in PC or laptop. The only downside is probably its incompatibility with some devices especially those not coming from the worldwide known brands but it is still possible because i for myself was able to get it to work on my locally branded smartphone. Excellent app. Thanks developers."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"App freezes on open documents. Does a good job converting if it stays up long enough."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Unresponsive, templates do not work. Curser is over sensitive to touch. Help button says help is not loaded. Galaxy S3. Uninstall."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Download"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I am revising my review because it now works on my Samsung Galaxy note 2. It is an adjustment because the interface is similar to the desktop program, which is why it gets 4 stars from me.  Love all the options though! A must have for anybody working with .odt files."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Its very excellent."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Used an external mouse (through OTG) with my Nexus 7, and this works great! Everything I've been waiting for in office for android."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Runs great. Just as well as the  quick open office that costs $15."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"When I installed the earliest version if this app, it was useless. It didn't even work as a reader, let alone as an editor. I'm pleased to see how much effort the developer is putting into fixing its many problems. In its current version, 1.1.3, the app is stable, the display is readable, and the keyboard, toolbars and menus are functional. Probably better suited to a tablet than a phone, though. I'd love to see the interface redesigned to fit a phone's display better."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Supergreat"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Working only horizontally not vrtically my device have chipset Mt6577 with GPU (smartphone ISA A19). I like it, it need to be upgraded (compatibility with kernel 3.x.x android 4.2.1 graphic and mouse pointer look not sexy but still ok) Please, Do a openoffice Base (database) working..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"First version that works on my tablet. Getting better but still needs some adjustments for tablet. Especially needs improvements for touchscreens."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I hae program on my computer and love it. However, it will not even function in it's app format on my Galaxy S4. Literally won't even start!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I'sorry."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I cannot open anything - it just keep on crashing... But I want this app to work, so I waiting for an update on this..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Don't open 1/2 of the time. Locks up on any option. Just crap"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Yes it needs work and a touch based interface instead of cursor based, but it is great to see that it has been ported and look forward to future versions"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"small screen issues, will b checking back & downloading when fixed! love open office!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"This app is not good, files cannot be edited or downloaded. It say you can doqnload and edit files, well you cannot."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"The cursor is a bit useless on my tablet. No way to leave the app."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"I use apache to write on my pc all the time and was excited to take my work on the go, however I can't even successfully open this program 90% of the time. Very disappointing Please fix this"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"We use the openoffice suite on our pc, laptops and tablets (New to us). If they are as fantastic on our tablets as they are on our pc and laptops, we will be jumping up and down with giddy delight! Thank you for this awesome product!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Installed & uninstalled a number of times but still the latest version hangs up before i have time to do anything with it on my Galaxy Tab 10.1. Will wait again to try the next versions attempt to fix this as i love it on my PC"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Spreadsheet and text editor and presentation app don't work. They won't even start, up I'm going to uninstall."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"1.0.0 was problematic (crashes), and 1.0.1 had problems with my keyboard. 1.0.2 seems to be something I can try to use as they keyboard fully now works properly. Time to start writing...I'm really looking forward to the ODF support, the read/write support is only available in AndrOpenOffice; everyone else only has read if they support it at all."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"some serious bugs dealing with the small screen.  default keyboard controls assume keys absent on my device.  keep at it."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"It gets to 75% then stops and never completes. Totally unuseable."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"While it barely works I am very happy to see someone finally getting a serious (and one of the very few) open office editors up and running.  Thus my 4 - we have to encourage this guy to keep going... eventually it will work and we will have back some of our freedom back, with the ability to use openoffice documents across all our systems."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"when opening files by clicking them it will load 3/4 and time-out. When opening the app none of the menu options will react. Mouse pointer moves but that's all. Shame as I use OOo for all my text and spreadsheets and wanted to use this so I could work on the road. Hope it will be available in working version soon. Edit: process is stopped by watchdog."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Didn't work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"I know it takes your time very much to make andropenoffice.  I'm impressed, but still many problem  Only use calc , when open a spreadsheet sometimes it hungs. When the spreadsheet opened. Sometimes it didn't response from anything. Touch nor physical keyboard (I use usb keyboard and bluetooth keyboard on galaxy s3). Keep good work and make it exellent. Thumb up..."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"this is rubbish i cant click on anything or type anything! its like the whole thing is a fake picture!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Though the developer has been able to emulate the desktop feel, the usage is absolutely worthless. Keeps hanging."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"Very good if it is work on my phone"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"As per the developer instructions, I installed the updated application. I am getting several size errors (ie. width and height must be >0 whenever I try to load a spreadsheet. I'm thinking this could be a problem with my device, so I'll keep trying to see if I can get it to read (possibly) a larger document. I am running this app on an Acer A100 with Android version 4.0.3. However, other open document files render and edit just fine. Nice work."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",5,"t"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",4,"Fast and quite easy to use."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"Open Office provides free editable program for p.c. but doesn't follow suit with android. Good thing is I can read my OK docs saved on p.c. through FS server. Bad point is that a basic document app is not editable. I get the need for cash flow but to stay in step with open freeware at least the word document app should be fully editable with all editable features and free. Cash flow could come from charges on fully functional Draw Calculate Viewer and those other M.S Office competitive programs instead."
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",3,"Excellent if can edit .odp file..pls look into it!!"
"AndrOpen Office","Unknown",1,"App hung on the install. Never installed. Can't give a proper rate on the app. Very large size."
