"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrendous buggy glitchy neglected app. Great idea. Sadly, it doesn't work. Trying to export a project with any kind of complexity simply fails. Every. Single. Time. Hours and hours wasted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The exported video has a lot of glitches which don't show up in the editing window, I don't know what the issue is.. tried it on multiple android devices yet it's the same"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever using this waste app, rendering make too long , Kindly other users do not use this one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Automatically made my videos high pitched. Not user friendly at all. Sticking to CapCut"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i got a phone with 12Gb RAM but the app still keeps freezing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"BAD"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So useless...spent an hour editing only for it to fail at 16% while trying to saveüò≠üò≠nktt"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every video I have uploaded within the past month has distorted audio. Sounds like it's slowed down but when I speed it up it still sounds terrible. I cleared my cache and data and still having this issue. Fix it please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why Adobe you disappointed us on mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to export a video in the app says ""some error occurred, please try again! It does not tell you what the error is so pointless doing an edit that cannot be exported."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is my go-to android video editing app. It's precise, intuitive, stable, and can sync multiple audio tracks well (but not automatically). It's missing things like captions and 4:3 aspect ratio and sync with Premiere Pro that could make it exceptional."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible... I was putting the finishing touches on a video that I've been working on for two days. I go to add an emoji to a graphic and it crashes and now it won't let me open the project back up without the app failing. I'm going to find a new app that won't get rid of all of my progress over an emoji."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even export a single clip with speed effect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I've been using for 4 years now, originally as a stop gap for premier pro, but it is still my go to editing software, beautifully easy...I have to use other software to reverse clips etc but if anything it's made me a better videographer as I think about the editing process as I shoot. Some reviews mention exporting issues I have experienced this as well, but usually a close down app and restart solves. It's aimed at beginners and its so easy, but as a professional its a joy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Works, but 1080p max, really?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible, unusable app just like everything adobe does."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Impossible to work with .mov file"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very poor üëé for tablet Poco pad üò∞üò∞can not up quality videos üëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App crashes when used in Samsung Dex. It would be nice to use the app when connected to a larger external display but it crashes constantly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"bro this doesn't even have keyframesüò≠"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor download now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Does not have auto captions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its good but actually needs to be seriously upgraded so that it will. Be able to outclass other competitors in mobile market. Features smooth keyframes, animations & transitions are must needed. Key framing is must. Effects like available in Adobe Premiere Pro are available should be available in mobile app. If not all then basics should be. Thats all, otherwise this will be going like this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to produce smooth output from a single 720p 30fps file. Takes forever to render unusable video. Unable to playback video in app while editing. Useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So my Galaxy S10 is supported! But a Galaxy s22 ultra is not! explain the stupidity!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Je bal paro nah seta Korte aso ki jone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even play a 4K video properly.. Complete garbage! üí©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"OK"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst one.. how do I save a project??? It just doesn't let me.. the loading wheel keeps rotating.. nthng.. it only saves the first imports only... Nthg more... Worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Errors errors unsupported files more errors waste of time find something else."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app ever. Other video editing apps are much better than this on an Android tablet."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"When import video from my gallery the sound like ghost. I dont use any effect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Continually tells me it doesn't have permissions that it does have. Galaxy S24 FE."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Super slow, takes forever for it to cut and delete a section of the video. Constantly crashes and kicks me out of the app. Capcut was such a better editing system I'm pissed they banned it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it can only access local storage or its cloud. i take videos on phone and want to edit on tab. i use google for cloud backup. not supported. backup files to external drive. not listed. ridiculous. looking for alternative"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app frequently crashes while editing video speed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Incredibly laggy app right off the bat. Have to wait between every action - deleting, splitting, and moving clips is so slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whenever I upload a video of me taking, the sound is clearly distorted, like an octave lower, before I've even touched any of the settings. The text options are also needlessly limiting. I don't want any of these transition graphics; I just want to put captions on my vertical video, but I guess I'll have to wait for CapCut to come back or check out Canva's video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"That app really sucks! And from a company that makes a ton of money you would expect better. üòû"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A. Small as hell B. No way to import sounds... Or maybe I'm too dumb... C. Useless... I can't do anything with it that small"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Such a frustrating app. For the amount we pay for subscriptions this app should function better. It's so slow. I try to click one function and it takes 6-10 seconds to work. A 60 sec video takes 3hrs to edit. If capcut wasn't banned in the U.S. i would just use that. Smh."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works fine for me!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ui is a mess"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app üòë"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I need this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not suitable for background noise removal"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App black screens and crashes every time you try to export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bought the pro version and it just keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I tried Adobe Premiere Pro's 3-day free trial, but it was disappointing. At $34.99/month, it's much pricier than PowerDirector ($34.86/year) and KineMaster ($14.12/year). Editing a 34 GB 4K 60 FPS video took 4 hours to render, but the exported file was only 1.5 GB, with black clips and playback stopping after 2-3 minutes. The app frequently became unresponsive, disrupting my workflow. For its cost, the performance and stability don‚Äôt match expectations. Cheaper apps perform better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but recently, whenever I make clips, it exports as a black screen. Never used to do this, but it does it every time now no matter the size of the video. Used to have an issue where the export would gradually load and then the app would crash at 70% or something. Frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"needs updating, nolonger works on new phones 2025, my phone won't even install it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes ALL THE TIME. 30 years experience with Adobe software and this has to be the worst ever!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, best editing tool I've ever experienced on my smart phone. Pretty nice app, but I have to tell u this, need to improve the bugs. Appart from that, 1000 wonders."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's a cool little tool that I can definitely see content creators using successfully for short videos. Anything longer than a minute or too complex would be too fiddly to cut in Rush. It is expansive though, there seem to be a lot of features but variables aren't always easy to tweak or seem impossible to change at all. Haven't tried to export yet but I'll update the review when I have How do you rename a sequence? How do you edit title text?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Video edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not able to import sound from phone...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice so far, but extremely limited exporting options (can't choose codec, quality, etc)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Successfully edited My first video only for it to put the first clip at the very end and not support moving clips around on the timeline. Just don't install the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editor for enhance video quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Itsüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm a content creator this is good for my videos also go to RandomTopics_Dan2 & RandomDan"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simply love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It doesn't export, if they fixed that it would be perfect, esp the way you can fix sound by boost, noise reduction, pitches etc"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Ok good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's amazing using Adobe Premiere Rush, but there's no where to import audio from external source"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Kinda dodgy, not fully featured."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"aw man i cant draw is there 1 way to draw"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Truely terrible performance on my Galaxy S24 Ultra. The app crashes when importing multiple files. It hangs constantly during editing. Very poor software from Adobe when compared against competitors like Capcut or other freemium editors."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good for personal use but with limited features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"realy good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just wasted my time in the sign in process where after waiting for so much time all I get is error"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bes t android video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Such a pro level app‡•§ U can try it for ur video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"""some error occurred""... I cannot use the app that I'm paying a monthly fee for.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect little tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App won't download to laptop from Google Play. Told to download to my phone! Who would prefer to edit videos on a smart phone and not a laptop ???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent software, recommended!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice ... because it is also used by khan sir"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app. Would love some audio fade and more level control....control points or rubber band. And also the choice to add transitions on the end or start of clip not automatically both ends."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I liked how i could organize all my videos for a quick edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is too good I'm giving it a five star review"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This app is meant for basic editing of videos only. There are few animations of titles and other essentials like yt subscribe buttons etc. which are helpful. I didn't like how the app changes audio pitch, once it is used in the sequence. However, you get original audio in the exported version. So it's good. For what this app is designed for, i.e only basics, I have given it a 4 star. However more features and effects should be added in the free version also."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So simple and easy to use. Removed every other app. No stupid watermarks, no shenanigans. Get the work done!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A lot of features missing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Use it daily! Love it! Can't complain! I use it for shorts i found some very long videos I needed to screen record because the export lost itself after about 12 minutes and became choppy and then un watchable. I just make longs on my computer now. This is PERFECT for shorts and really easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very useful for quick YouTube shorts. But I find it very fiddly to use graphics titles. Hard to see what you are typing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not too shabby. Could use some more features but not bad overall. Pretty simple to pick up and start editing. Recommend üëçüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't export using footage I'd recorded on my Samsung Galaxy S23 FE and I wasted a lot of time and effort and had to re-record on another program. I'd upgraded to Premium and it still didn't work. Deleted the app and thought the subscription was cancelled only to be charged!! Be warned ‚ö†Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy intuitive and good qualit y"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So annoying. Glitches when color correcting, so you need to restart it. Then it downgrades the video later"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"if you're able to get past the loading bar after clicking which video(s) you wanna edit, then it's a great quick editing app. other than that, I have to constantly force close/stop the app and reopen hoping it'll load this time, rinse and repeat."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"if you can avoid Adobe subscriptions ..DO IT..Adobe is overpriced and behind in features functionality...the free version of capcut will do more than even premiere pro for most social media projects.. Or use davinci which is free and has all the features you need to edit big projects ....ADOBE needs to be more in touch with the market or it Will continue to decline in revenue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Keeps refreshing and crashing. Trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"editing is quite slow right now. I think it's needs to be updated to latest Android version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great App."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful better than capcut"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good and perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm not impressed. Don't expect many features with this app. Not designed to be a mobile editor, just stick to your pc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Quite good vertical video editing suite. However, we are not able to add our own music. We are forced to used audio from the terrible unknown album."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This won't let me post on tiktok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app for edit videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amzing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Imagine a video editing app where the video you're editing is the size of your pinky nail. And you can't do a full screen preview. How can a big company release an app like this? It's not a new app. It's like taking a cooking class where you can't taste the food. Or using recording software where you're only able to hear a low-bit version of your recording. Why?? It's video editing. We have to see what we're doing. I immediately downloaded a better app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and provides nice enough quality for editing. Thx so much"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Showing""Your device is't compatible with this version"", I am using OnePlus 11T. Kindly check. You advertised we can use this on Android phone. So i upgrded."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's really good editing nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to edit text at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to work with. Great for what I need it for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best mobile video editor I've ever used."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app crashes a lot after 30minutes of use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I haven't used the app in a while. I only messed with it for a bit today. I screenrecorded some of my music on google drive and it slowed it down and pitched it down every time I separated the audio. I looked up the problem and someone claimed it was an issue with screen recorded audio. I then downloaded the WAV file directly from drive and imported it. Same issue. No matter what I did, the audio was slowed and pitched down. I'm not going to pitch it back up every time. Great video editing tho"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice, works well & intuitive. If you need to edit a video, like at all, this is the easiest option. It seems to screw up the colors of my videos, makes them very dull. It doesn't do this if I use rush to record, but importing my own recordings makes it look like a movie graveyard filter."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sana Maka edit ako"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty much useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you edit text while using the app on android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It took me less than 2 minutes to edit a video I took in a way that's ""good enuff"" for an Instagram story. I'm impressed!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This was a terrible app to use, deleted it after a few minutes. Imported video audio keept going low pitched and slower. When you delete some objects they can get bugged and still appear in the timeline aswell."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"WHY NOW YEAR DELETE!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not bad editor but lots of features are behind pay wall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Amazing. Quick video editing app, but it does need a major update. Cutting and moving around files are difficult to do when trying to cut a the frame point. And the magnetic video connecter is dated. There's a few things like quick captions and transition effects that should be implemented in here also. I do enjoy using it, but it's not free and cap cut and other competitors are doing more for free at this day and age."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I hate it so much. It always rotates to portrait to landscape to portrait and so on. This isn't fake I have experienced this. Like fix this app or smth. I cant even edit bc it always huts my brain when it rotates to portrait to landscape and so on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app has been amazing for me, making videos is something I have been able to do creatively almost as if I were painting a picture or sculpting granite or molding gold with diamond inlay, this app has been a benefit to my life for sure.. at least when I have a place to stay and a vehicle and a decent phone and camera and drone lol üòÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and portable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Unusable. Moving a video across the timeline duplicated and desynced my audio, defeating the purpose of a video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"As long as you don't do any effort to improve your app for Android you'll be a second hand option"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Laggy, keeps crashing, very basic features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an easy to use product and this is it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best on the go editior I've used. K.i.s.s."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesn't let me choose bitrate export settings"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good Editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than I Expected"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Getting hang"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It just deleted parts of my video and audio and it kept lagging and glitching. It's very easy to figure out like what tools are where and how to use them (kind of) but the rest is just, no."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Argh I hate this app, it's just so slow I downloaded it and picked the footage I wanted to use but it's been preparing that footage ever since"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very best and simple video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ÿπÿßŸÑ€å"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible, I have the Asus CM34 Chromebook Plus and the app instantly shuts down when I try to add anthing to a project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Audio syncing to video is not precise enough. It works, but wish it could be more precise like the desktop version. Very quick and simple to use and incorporate media with multi layer functions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Iv only used it for a few days but so far works great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"for some what reason, your app keeps on lowering the quality of video upon rendering. if i can put zero, i will."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's best app ever seen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The interface is complex and limited functionality compared to VN"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy & useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely good for something free like this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Background editing not a separate"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is a great tool for people that have busy lives allows you too create and edit videos while busy doing multiple tasks that are a priority in day to day life, so if your a multi Tasker give this app a try and get your video editing completed quickly and most importantly with quality. thank you google and thank to my brothers and sisters moms and dad's grandmas and grandpa's thank you all the way back to the first human that experienced the miraculous ability to have intelligent thoughts."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly on Galaxy S23+ with zero support from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Exporting videos always fails, it SAYS it saved the video to the gallery, but it just doesn't, your video simply disappears"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow and keeps crashing. No reverse video function. Poor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"App usability is proved. Formerly rated only 3 stars."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Sometimes there is a lag"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"unusable.... keeps crashing, menus lock up, tracks clear randomly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Edit... broken again Edit... they fixed the app and it works again. it is slower than it was before though. This app worked great at first but a recent update made it unusable. of course the update came just days after I paid for a year of the premium plan"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Difficult to use, missing basic features such as full screen preview, simple text options, filters etc. Not being able to full screen preview your video pretty much makes it useless since the image is so small it could be anything and I am using it on a large android S24 Ultra, a tablet wouldn't be much better :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"""App isn't responding"" *Samsung s24 ultra top spec. Yikes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple interface, intuitive controls, just works real damn well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to learn how to work on it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not available for Samsung S22!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Santali Alphabet Olchiki not working."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just use capcut. This app doesn't even have half the functionality that capcut has for free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A fantastic video editing tool. Relatively simple to start using with some decent features! Drawback, there has been several times where it will seem to stall, crash, or become unresponsive. Not sure if it's a ram issue but I don't have a bunch of apps installed. Despite the negative, I still very much enjoy using Rush!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not compatible with my S22 Ulta ?!, wth !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and effective Been using this app for a few years now and still my go to app for my video creations for work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly and very limiting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's great but update is required"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'm a premiere user, and the app is sort of a lite version of that software, but unfortunately, for whatever reason, I can't edit the overlay titles or add text to the video! It could be good if it was more polished!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ridham doesn't open your message at all, I'm upset"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good on go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazingly robust and free video editor for Android! If you need to shoot, edit, and post within an hour, this tech and your skills can deliver. Premium features add more function and polish. But this free version works perfectly for my needs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome colour grading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Incredibly useful, lags a lot but that's alright"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's nice to have some of the Adobe tools on my phone to edit something real quick, but honestly it seems like the app is very glitchy and it messes up the audio on my video clips pretty often, as well as puts little glitched frames into the video pretty often as well. I have said a couple swear words while using this app and I never swear. UPDATE: I really struggle with this app even more now, because the have somehow made it so my phone, A Google pixel 7 pro, is no longer compatible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"There is 0 ability to add titles or graphics. My app is updated, and this has been a known problem for over a year (Fixed). The app adds ""sequence 1"" to the end of every saved clip. Vignette is clunky. System storage low error message even with over a gig of space free. Can't save projects to SD card. But works pretty well, and intuitive if you use Premiere. Can't use specific numbers instead always have to use the sliders. Would love a way to buy royalty free music in-app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The application acts up once in a while.Sometimes they don't want load videos, sometimes it just crashes, but overall, I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fun night and to y the in,? to throw some‚Åµ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"My experience was not great, but I still think it has a lot of potential. The app kept freezing whenever I would add multiple transitions to my video and had to re-open the project just to get it to work again. The mobile app is a great idea you just gotta fix those bugs!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app! Simple to use."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"If you are familiar with editing software, you will love this quick handheld process. The playback isn't perfect but acceptable... This is my first time using it for a short reel, I will do another review after a longer, more intense video. (I used a Z Fold 4 512GB phone if it matters)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There is a thing unacceptable When I open the app it's just swiping like portrait landscape portrait landscape like that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"REALLY THE WORST APP EVEN WORST THEN LEAP APP ü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æü§Æ"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hot Garbage - I have the large Adobe paid bundle and this is yet another app in a long line of non-functional programs from what used to be a great company. The program runs slow, crashes on basic functions, and doesn't even play back your video. Very soon canceling my subscription to Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy, simple, works great üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb whiting software with phenomenal capabilities"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden, it stopped working, and the Play Store says this app is not compatible with your device.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Pretty mid user experience, the audio preview and video is out of sync sometimes. It takes a long while to preview he audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Having a lot of issues with importing videos lately. Especially during that outage period recently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stay for away from this app , lost all my projects , doesn't sync from pc to mobile. My actual projects the raw videos are gone and all I see of my work is a red screen with white exclamation mark . Done with Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice, finally found the perfect video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than Basics"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ALWAYS crashes , only good for combining clips together, terrible for any other use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thik you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It was best editor for me, but now it doesn't work for couple months. Very sad. Developers do nothing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app Cool for quick edit"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So cool app to edit video and its easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love Adobe but this is nowhere is good as the one on the computer the app is not really user-friendly but overall I like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crashes mid rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It is very simple for beginners."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Improve, you have the likes of Capcut dominating the market, this product can't compete. I'm holding out for you guys though, please improve."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When adding media to edit, it sounds like it's in slow mo."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very handy for quick content"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video corruption"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant upload file Failed to load data error happen everytime"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"1 star because Adobe still refuses to implement a full screen preview in 2024, you have to export videos to see any kind of meaningful changes, especially color changes, because the preview does not show them well or at all. This is absolutely insane and proves that their design team does not use the products they work on, imagine wanting to PREVIEW your work BEFORE exporting it!? Infuriating incompetence!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The Best video editor for android phone. Easy, simple, great results."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just few editsling options, but enough for basics. And perfect by adobe as usual"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I start to used this app long time ago but time to move forward and cancel the subscription. Absolutely useless, start to editing 4K Gopro video but the screen is black and no way to do any editing. I deleted then reinstall multiple time but there is the same issue. Anyone can recommend a good usable app for phone please, I'm in the middle of a project I need it ASAP. Goodbye Adobe Rush, you deserve lost all your client. Welcome any suggestion for a new editing app. Cheers"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There is no mobile version for newer Android phones."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love using this app for editing. Worth it 10/10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"waste of time trust me dont waste data"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"genuinely the best editing software on mobile that ive used so yeah"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"But it need a name plate"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really good app for video editing. I just hope it will be available for tablet too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't use at all. Force closes all the time. This app has always had it's problems but now... no uploading, no rendering, no nothing. Any in app purchases get your money back now. This app is horrible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"doesnt work on pixel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not yet use all funtions ill change the rate after all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Immediately uninstalled when they ask to give them all of my creative data, I know now, how sneaky Adobe is"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No support from Adobe. Shouldn't they be the leaders in video editing? I mean come on, I pay a subscription for this. Add new features and fix the bugs!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app and nicely edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I downloaded the app about a month ago. Spent several hours on a project but when I tried to export it, it got stuck at 3%. Went online and realized this was a common error and Rush apparently hasn't been tested on new Android versions and phones since years back. The developer team has been informed about people having these issues (i.e. spending hours and hours on videos they can't use) and released an update a few days back. Now when I try to render all I get is an error message."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best Phone Video Editor, It would be even better if it had a lot of functions The minimal functions it has now Limit the possibility of what can be done."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"While editing i only listen audio and can't edit it because nothing is showing from the video very bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update 2: As of 9/17/24 can no longer render in 4k despite paying to do so! Update: Here I thought it couldn't get any worse... It seems adobe knew their sync problem was too big to fix so they just took that feature away! Time to cancel my subscription. Not worth the money. Can't render a project past 10% on my phone, but it'll render just fine on my computer. Defeats the whole purpose of this app, which was to edit and produce on both phone and computer depending on where I'm at for work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gets job done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why do we need to make a account to edit a video? It's buggy aswell with makeing a account"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe Rush what happened? My last review I was having problems with images coming through but now with the update today the videos are coming through but the quality of them looks pixelated and foggy. 3 updates ago the app was working perfectly fine but now?! Please fix the app I love and heavily use for making content."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Only giving me a black screen for preview for days now. Un-installed. Reinstalled. Cleared data. Cleared. Cache. Nothing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Been using Rush for years now, however now all of a sudden videos just have a black screen when editing?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good all round editing suite for a mobile phone. BUT it almost often doesn't render a video once I've finished editing it. It starts then freezes. So it's now a useless pointless app. update; now when trying to edit I only get a black preview screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Having the same issues as others since the update. My videos won't show on the timeline or render. All I see is a black screen, yet I can still hear the sound. I use this for work, including editing for auditions and this is really screwing me. Like others have stated, if this is not resolved soon, I will be canceling my subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not work Tried to render and it was stuck at 10% Tried a week later and now video is all black"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Recently Rush does not let me export audio without it skipping. MP3s, my own recordings, and now, video as wellü§∑. I've done everything and tried every work around. It's driving me crazy, especially since I have a CC subscription. This is unusable. Fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Adobe Premiere Rush is a slim down version of Premiere Pro but it works great while on the go. 9/14/2024: Black screen on playback when editing. The audio part works fine, but video or photo shows black screen when editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update 09/14/2024 No longer usable on Android phone. Photos and video can not be viewed in the editor, heard it would export fine, but cam not export either. It just fail as soon as you hit the button. Completely worthless now. If you are on Android, find something else because they destroyed this app. Great when it works, no so much when it fails to render and wastes my time. Edit 06/07/23 It has only gotten worse over time, now it lags and doesn't play smoothly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At first it worked perfectly and I loved it. Then the preview screen suddenly wouldn't show any video, even after resetting the app, reinstalling the app, whatever. If you can't see the video you're editing, it's useless. I've checked their help forums and people have described this happening back in 2020, but I haven't seen official replies to fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Issue: Adobe Rush wont render. Im unsubscribing. Adobe rush on my S23 is unusable. I had a lengthy Chat with Adobe Support yesterday but couldnt resolve the issue. Ending was I got told to wait for engineers to sort this out. So Im unsubscribing. Too many issues fir my liking. Dont get me wrong, i think adobe is good. Im still using lightroom and photoshop ( because they are still working üòÜ). But I don't want to be paying for an app that is unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everything I add to a project shows up blank and all I can see is the black background. And the fixes online say update your graphics card. üôÉ Seriously? It worked two months ago without a new graphics card. I can't even record footage in the app either since it loads blank."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. This app has never worked on 90 percent of the android market, but Adobe still characterizes it as working. When is this going to work? There is no answer. This is one of many reasons people are leaving Adobe. If they spent time making the products work instead of spying on, and stealing from, their customers people would stay."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"all imported videos appear as a black screen. please fix. GALAXY TAB S8"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Recent update has prevented videos being shown in editor. Android, Samsung S22 Ultra. Worked fine before this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Videos don't show anything other than black. I reset the app, cleared cache, everything. Even using the sample videos, all I see is black. Super disappointing and cannot use app for its purpose at all, we pay for the cloud and can't access any of these features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very useful app I'm using it many days u can trust it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always a problem, never speeds up editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Will not work on Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro. Export freezes after 10 to 15 percent, or just gives failed to export error. Same in both phones. Got only 1 good export by removing all transitions. Pitiful they can't get this to work on top end phones with up to date OS."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even handle a jpeg image."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not preview media (Empty Canvas) on S24 Ultra"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have been a long-time user of this app, and lately, from the update, it won't let me see my video, but I can hear it? It just shows a black screen? If it don't get fixed soon I'm leaving this app and will put my money elsewhere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Black screen. Glitchy. Doesn't work on my s24ultra"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app is unusable on my phone after the new update. I loved its previous versions, but the last two updates had a lot of problems. I can't view the videos or photos when I upload them to the timeline, and it won't render anything. I'm hoping for an improved version soon because it was super useful when it worked previously. I'll be downloading it again as soon as the new version is available."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Updated review (Sep 11th 2024) I take back previous good review! 9 months later this will still not render videos on the Pixel 7/8/9 pro! I did a fresh Install using the beta branch, everything seemed fine, rendered a very basic 20 second video with no edits. But the moment you apply an additional layer of video or audio, a transition or effect the render time takes an eternity. I know this used to work, prior to December 2023 I could make a fairly complex 5 minute video and it would render."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Still finding it out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For the last few months, this App has been troubling me. Lot of Glitches, and some video clips are getting blurred. There's an Issue while Exporting the complete edited video. I even cleared Cache, Installed and uninstalled the app multiple times, yet no change! Please Fix this ASAP!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am tired of developers depending on users to tell them what needs to be fixed. This app is garbage compared to other mobile videos editing apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Much better if it was having chroma key but ya nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The videos aren't even exporting, I left it running all night and it was still stuck at 11% tried again this morning and it just sits there after a few % and doesn't go any further! Pretty useless if you ask me. *UPDATE SEPT 11TH 2024* Still not fixed and still taking forever to export, actually can not export! USELESS!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Idk anything"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Will not render. Pixel 6 10 second clip stuck at 2% unusable app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just downloaded it and it keeps crashing before I can even see a tutorial."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Decided to take a video editing and design class to up my game. Adobe is the go-to for educational programs, which is truly sad. I have to up my game on the worst software out here. Literally! How can I get better after 5 years of experience going to a program that not only freezes and crashes with every move you make but doesn't have half the features of it's competitors. Adobe thinks we are stupid enough to think we need Pro to get more, that sucks even more compared to competitors!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Free to use with premium features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just cropped a small part of the video and tried to render it. But it crashed because Adobe made a great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever. It never exports anything. Just stays at 1%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"First, this app is good to simply edit not more. But, my experience with Adobe Rush is not good enough to use it because you have limited tools and features Second, I noticed Adobe Rush after rendering the video, I see the quality of the video is bad than before in some videos and also Audio too, and this problem in Adobe Rush himself because I use filmora and capcut and this problem doesn't exist Third, paying monthly it is not a good idea to get more important basic features you need it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes when you try to export. It is unusable. Adobe's support isn't helpful and their only response is to shoot the footage again. The app started well a long time ago and has slowly become worse and worse. It doesn't even sync to your Adobe account so you can't continue working on your desktop. Avoid the pain, don't download it. Surprised it's still allowed to be on the play store."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"dont use this. 1) i cannot render video iny google phone 2) files cannot be syn to cloud to be used for desktop version 3) the project cannot be saved to other locations for backup purpose"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is. Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't use this at all. Crashes on a S24 Ultra when I start a project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The export of 4k 60fps is the slowest I have ever used on any video editing app. This makes the app unusable for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app. Now it's utterly useless since you can't export anything. I sit here watching it render for half an hour and it never goes above 1 or 2%. What a joke."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Awful. Spent hours editing a video, and when it comes to time to export, it says I am missing files, which I am not. Waste of my time and waste of my life."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I'm opening app first time after installing I can't signing up bcz app keep rotate around my screen I don't know what's error"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It gets the job done. But its mega frustrating how many glutches it has. U need some crazy fast Internet for it to work properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Horrendous ux. Glitchy. Not optimised for landscape which is... something."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not stable in sumsung fold 6, pls help"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So laggy and never works. Spent 4.5 hours editing just for it to delete everything"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously terrible given that it's part of an insanely overpriced subscription service. The sucky TikTok video editor is vastly superior. ""Rush isn't responding Close app or wait?"" This is the most unoptimized slow junk I've use on a modern phone in a long time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I got this app to start making/editing videos for my personal chef business. I've only just begun using the app, but I really like it so far. I'm very NOT tech savvy, so the fact that this is so user friendly amd even I can use it, says a lot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not render videos on Pixel 8."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly is slow and shuts down"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's impossible to use on S22 ultra"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good and fast but does not support 21:9 aspect ratio so that's a no go for me. Hopefully adobe can add that aspect ratio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This could be a great mobile option with the desktop version but development is slow and there are many bugs. One being transparent video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Seems ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible glitches I can't believe it but power director is better over this app that I have a $50 sub for how hard is it to just edit basic vid on your phone to export the project to the computer...right away the screen glitches up with broken video on this. The search continues"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience, it claims to save export 'locally' but can't find the file anywhere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really decent video editing app when you just want to put a couple of video and audio files together"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I love the editing tools that rush provides, but it is constantly crashing and reseting, creating a very annoying editing experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy video editing app to use for beginners while also a great tool for the experienced. I love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing. For 30 Euro per year, I'd rather capcut. I spent 3 hrs editing a bunch of videos and then I couldn't export them because ""some error occured..."" Thanks for the informative error message, I guess. I had to duplicate the project to export it in pieces. To add insult to injury, the ""rate our app"" message popped up right after I exported the 1st half of my broken project. I'm very disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why are all my exports glitching, why are there no basic shape imports I.e rectangles and triangles, why is there no transparency settings for PIP, why does audio recording have this loud annoying metronome type of sound. My phone is 8gb of ram, how am I having so much processing errors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My words can't describe how bad this program is, processing takes a decade ( even for adding 10sec media lol) Program worths absolute ZERO stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Add a search bar to audio files"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Runs extremely poorly when exporting video on Google Pixel 9 Pro XL."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm rocking with it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot finish a video render from google pixel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A bit laggy I have used this app on Iphone and it's way smoother here on android Galaxy S24 Ultra is laggy but other than that is a great app I would definitely recommend it!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adobe took away the ability to sync with Creative Cloud, making it near impossible to use multiple devices to edit projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worthless if it can't sync to creative cloud for upload to premiere pro or any other Adobe apps on the desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Well l didn't tey everything and all effects but it was good but on computer and pc better it is little bit hard in mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This was a good app that I would normally give a 4 star rating - not perfect but good enough. However the android app seems to have a glitch that has been present for many months. Video no longer renders meaning you cannot export your projects. many users are reporting this issue. Please fix as you're continuing to take users' money for a broken app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Paid for a subscription, then found the app wouldn't render. Tried everything but it wouldn't go past 10%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good app but its crashing at every export after the update, please fix the bug"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app for videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just used Rush to combine clips. Super!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rushing to install a better app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Adobe Rush is an excellent and intuitive video editing app in regards of layout and design, however it has been plagued by many lingering performance and stability issues. All too often in my experience, the app consistently freezes, crashes, or is completely unresponsive. And when/if you complete your project, the rendering process often freezes, or completely stops. I am quite certain these performance/stability issues could be fixed via app updates if there is the will to do so. ü§û"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very worst app...."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A lot of problems with exports. Freezing at random percentages on multiple tries"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Only good cause its an option that exports wav files without distortion, but not even close to other video editing apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! :-)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've used Rush for many years and never had a problem. The editing is very basic and doesn't have nearly as much freedom as actual Premiere, but it's a simplified version that gets the job done for simple edits. However, I recently encountered an exporting issue. I have tried multiple times to export a file but it just gets stuck at a percentage and never completes. I had to download another app to edit. Very upsetting since we pay for a membership and have to resort to using free apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It would be useful if only I could export the videos... Totally useless, the rendering never ends and it gets stuck all the times. All of this on Pixel 8 Pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Aimed for social media with 4 realy basic aspect ratios and no custom options... and im going to bet the export options are even worse, its too much to ask a basic functionality from a video editor?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app no longer works on new phones. I recently upgraded to a Google Pixel 8 Pro and this device is not supported. A short list of older Android models are supported. This doesn'take any sense. Now all of my current unrendered projects are stuck in limbo, unable to be exported. Will there be a fix or did I just lose all of the work?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"facing slow rendering issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow very helpful app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app crashes a lot so it makes it difficult to work with it sometimes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For the first time I am disappointed that I can't leave 0 stars. Apart from the very intuitive interface the app itself is totally useless. Crash every two seconds, impossible to export any video longer then 1 0 second, pay for premium that doesn't improve the specs. Worst editing app I have ever tried. I have the latest model of Sony so top specs phone, no excuse on Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lacks basic features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst video editing app on Android. Unable to even export a 1.5 minutes clip on a flagship phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It has been given error after error lately. Also it's been distorting some of my videos when editing in this program"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very buggy. The extracted sound, sounds like alien. Yes, I modified the speed range thing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes almost immediately after opening without pressing anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Screenshots look great but you're very limited in what you can do and adding something simple like a bit of text and editing it is such a pain. Quicker to transfer the video to premiere video USB or email."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glitch preventing download"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective thanks for making it, very beginner friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is unusable. It crashes as soon as you try to do any type of editing. Incredibly frustrating..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"super uncomfortable to work with details on video, because it has microscopic sizes (vertical videos) also functions are very limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst video editor I have ever used. Tried to render a 15 second long video on my Pixel 7 Pro. Applied just a single preset filter. Still the render is getting stuck at any random percentage and then not moving forward at all. I don't know what is the problem with this app. Tried reinstalling the app but the render still gets stuck. Extremely bad and unsatisfying experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have been spoiled by Adobe for the past 20 plus years. To see an addition for smartphones was awesome."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing I when I first download the app it works fine and used it for a while so I want to use it again it had stopped working so I installed it reinstall it again and it works fine thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A lot like premiere on PC"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Infuriating. Looking forward to more updates."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I downloaded it for extra features when filming - but whenever i try to shoot a video using the app, it crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelente"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it even though I don't utilize it to its potential cuz I need a financial planner to afford the membership."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio cannot keep up with the playback so it sounds slow and low pitch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Normal"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better then I expected specially after Adobe outbers"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The capcut version of after affects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work on pixel 8 pro, go to render video and it hangs on 1%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash! This fails to do the most basic of things you need from an editing software - export your work! I can't tell you how pissed off I was after spending the time to for a project on this and then when it came time for exporting to be greeted with the message of ""Failed to export, try again"". It's not even telling me why it can't export, and when I try to export again the same error comes up. As someone who has a subscription to Adobe CC this is completely unacceptable!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst application. This application doesn't even have search option while choosing audio from the device folder. Literally lacking so many good features. I am moving to YouTube studio editing app. It is 10√ó better than this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No HDR support"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app.... for speed...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful... helping a lot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best editing app right now. üíú"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"No spot edits like spot blur or spot mask. This leaves the app unfit for most usecases requiring rush edit with smartphones."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is super Free version is enought to basic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"W and no ads editing app I surely recommend this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Exports gets stuck at 7%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful Just started using this. Loving it so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I get it's something to make quick videos out of, but honestly I wish there were more effects that I could use to make my videos pop out more"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It is amazing being able to control the speed of the video and is able to speed up or down to fit a certain time (recommended for clash royale and clash of clans)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very slow in Android but good in ipad. Can not add files from Gdrive directly in android. üò≠"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"100% useless. I tried importing video i recorded and it just said ""Unable to import media"" OK. Guess I'm moving on to another app. Adobe sucks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent AP of video editing, fast and easy to operate. The free version has enough for basic video editing. I would highly recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot export/render any videos regardless of length or content"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Since the recent Android update I can't export/render a single video it just. I used to love this app but now I'm frustrated Adobe can't fix its bugs in a timely manner."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easier to use and faster than the software I had been using."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's very basic, not a whole lot of options. Music library is nice, but when you have other apps that offer more transitions, visual effects, better/main stream music, and sometimes, a better editing experience, this app really falls short. Using multiple timeliness is a pain, and causes the app to crash. Editing for too long, the app crashes. It happens a little too often honestly. Sometimes you have to force close and reload the app just to was what filter/color settings have been applied."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible music, transitions, and overlays useless really"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't export videos. Using it on Pixel 8, and export of a 2 minute video goes at about one minute for one percent. Gets stuck at random spots, the most successful attempt was to get to 7 percent."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Make video good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I love using Rush in desktop and started using it on mobile. However you can't export after the most recent update. So it makes all your work pointless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It works but it's missing the most basic functionality: drag and drop to reorder layers. For some reason the default layer is immoveable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The edit portion is not bad to use, but the rendering is awful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App used to work amazing, I guess latest update essentially makes it mom functional in my phone. Cannot render videos anymore, it usually stops at 12 percent and will remain there for hours before I just end up hitting cancel. Not sure why they changed and why it's taking so long to fix it back"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing. All it does is freeze now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everything was good but now 1 min video is not even rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never finish any rendering, it's useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot export / render any of my projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"very good editing app for beginners like myself. there are a few things that need updating, but other than that pretty solid."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering of 9 seconds video take eternity"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Works Poorly on Redmi 12 Turbo This app shouldn't bear the premiere name at all. It lacks some of the most basic functions while constantly stutters and refuse to work properly. Sometimes it crashes mid-edit, or return to projects menu by itself. Other times it forgets that you have purchased the premium plan. A absolute joke from one of the most prolific editing software company."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not letting me export the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need more features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Am new and in 2days am getting around happily üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Surprisingly capable. But still needs a lot of improvement. The primary feature this app NEEDS is the ability to sync with your other devices. I know very well that adobe can do this. So why is it no longer a feature? If I could even sync just the project files then I would give this app a 3 star review."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The split tool is not functional on my pixel 7, this non-functioning tool makes this app unusable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for Making shorts while not at home. Simple user interface. Going to be using this alot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app has always been frustrating with frequent crashes and odd glitches that would sporadically end up in exported videos, but I still liked it best for quick edits for reels and stories for social media. However, this month my videos will no longer even render at all. It keeps saying it's loading but doesn't move past a couple percent. I kept hoping it would be fixed soon, but with all of Adobe's issues going on right now, I'm about to unsubscribe to all their programs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. One downside I've noticed, it gets slow when you make a lot of edits. Would recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"50 sec video rendering from 2hour üòÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does nothing but crash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Far from being a basic video editor, 3-4 sec of black screen in between when you merge 2 or more video files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I used to love it, but no one has been able to export now for over a month and they don't seem to be fixing it. If they do I will edit this review."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Goodddd very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Have always used this app on apple and now on android. User interface friendly, easy and fun to experiment with. I also use other Adobe apps they are the best by far and do not disappoint (mind you I have used other apps for video editing)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm utterly disappointed, this app is meant to be an Android alternative for the premiere pro, and in as much as it's not meant to replace it because of course you wouldn't want to edit workloads on your smartphone, it should at least be able to perform the basic tasks, you you can't add a recording from your local storage to your video, there are no curves, can you improve, please üôèüèæüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Export doesnt work with recent android version. Plz fix this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and learn, love this app for quick clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keep freezing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You files can't upload to Adobe cloud and can't upload to Dropbox. So if you can't render it on your phone, you're screwed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The editing of normal clips on the timeline is good for just simple work. But rather than that no other features are available like viewing the filters added and working on it. Colour grading is good. The worst part is none of the files gets exprorted. I have literally tried many times with different clips also, even a clip below one minute doesn't get exported. It shows exporting 40% for example and then it crashes. Literally the worst export. Never expected an Adobes application to be so worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't export, can't sync to cloud, can't transfer to desktop. Waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"More features on other apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've been using Adobe Premiere Rush for video editing, and I must say, it has been a highly disappointing experience. The app is riddled with bugs, making it nearly impossible to edit videos smoothly. Whenever I try to play back my edited videos, the screen goes blank and nothing appears. This issue severely hampers the editing process and makes the app practically unusable. Overall, Adobe Premiere Rush is a very poor app for video editing and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loveee!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for adjusting height and width of a video thanks adobeüò≥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app used to be really quick and simple to use to trim any fat off of things like tik toks so they fit within the one minute restriction of Instagram stories, however, now even after reinstalling a couple of times on some different devices, the app just gets hung up at 1% of the rendering process and just never finishes anything. - Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel 6."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"awesome Features Love iT üôÇ I Personally Suggest This App Some Advance Features Made This App little complicated But This App Provide All Features And I Love it ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freezes on export. I have a 13 second clip with audio and it doesn't render past 3%. Even letting it sit overnight doesn't budge anywhere past that percent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm paying a LOT for the whole Adobe package (Adobe Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Photoshop and After Effects) and you give us a half baked product? No ability to add keyframes? It baffles me that this tool is not yet made available when CapCut already does it (really miss it especially for scaling). Also, no video stabilisation function nor audio enhancement features. The text function also desperately needs an update. I pay a fraction for CapCut and it's waaaay better. Wake up Adobe Rush team!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"no export. Stuck on 2 percent all night."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful for last minute edits, lots of control even with free version!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Im happy ü•≥ü•≥üëçüèªü•≥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly app crashed when I tried to make a long video made my whole phone glitch and no my phone is not the app freezes randomly most annoying editing app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Works well when creating a movie. But it's useless since I can't export it from the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's janky and horrible and can't sync audio and video and makes messes but it's free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes all the time. Never installing again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I didn't see anything but black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not even a half-baked video editor. Worst of money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dose not open on Chrome Book duet 5"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was pretty happy with the App and the effortless way to cut videos etc. But since a few weeks I am unable to export any video... It always gets stuck in render somewhere in the first 0-12%. Reinstalling got all my projects deleted... And I am sad that there is no sync with the Desktop version... Which makes the App unusable for me right now..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice for minimal editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't export. How does a company of this size doesn't know how to create such a simple app?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Error every time I try to export the final video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"awwww yeahhhhh"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After the most recent Android update, Rush will no longer export any videos, whether they are 7 seconds long or 1 minute. I have LOVED this program previously, but now it is completely useless to me, and if it doesn't get fixed I will have lost all of my drafts since they no longer have a way to sync to the cloud. I waited 2 weeks before leaving this review, but it is still broken. I'm hoping it gets fixed soon so I can go back to loving this program."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"using it feels like a punishment. Everything from the interface to the features belongs to the stone age, you're better off using the gallery video editor. ah bonus point : it will often crash..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never renders any videos!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing and my go-to for cutting clips on the go... but after updating to Android 14 on Pixel 6 the render time has shot through the roof, with the percentage not changing for even half an hour... Unusable now. Please fix this!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I never imagine like this I think it was impossible without subscribtion outstanding performanceüî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No export functionality works..always gets stuck at around 18-24%. Also, even getting to that percentage takes a long time; Rush is a silly name for a product this slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't render videos. Tried many different solutions, searched for workflows online.. nothing. It just isn't a good app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always getting stuck at rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until recently. Made a 17 minute video 6 months ago and it worked great. Now this app won't render any video whatsoever. Small simple short ones or large and complex. I had done all the fixes and things to try to get it to go short of uninstalling. Nothing will render. Thankfully i was able to save my 4 months worth of work by screen recording the video through Rush as a backdoor redneck way of doing it. Stay away from this until it gets the bugs fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps lagging on S24, exporting crashes every time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Adobe Rush is something that I have only experienced on the paid tier, so I don't know what the free tier is like on Android. What I do know is that the multi-layered system for media and whatnot is so easy to use. It's just really organized, and I'm trying to look for other video editors to use when it's time to let Adobe go. Right now, Adobe Premiere Rush is something I am relying on, and I need to find a substitute before it's too late."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm using this on a Samsung tablet and it's honestly such a frustrating editing program to use. Perhaps I don't know how to use it BUT Adobe Rush is defo not going to be on my top list of apps to use for video editing...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I try to export the video it goes into rendering and the resulting video appears as an error, rather than the video I'm expecting. Can you help me fix this?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not being able to export video is a major drawback of this software in 2024."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Every feature are in perchance version please allow it in free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"At first it was hard to use but i learned it right away. Its kinda hassle to edit yes but overall its good. Pls add more filter please. Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to edit videos and audio's It is perfect for me. I love Rush ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Apparently, this isn't supported on Pixel 7 and Pixel 8 devices, pretty disappointing. I've had a lot of issues rendering anything more than a clip or two."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to handle"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app currently does not work on Pixel 7 pro. I cannot render and export videos. It takes forever to render and crashes at the very end. It's annoying that I can only edit on my PC and not on the go from my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Too many crashes for a service I spend hard earned money on. What's the problem? If you can't fix get rid of it, it's robbery at this point"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Export hangs between 1 and 20%, even at very short 60 sec projects. Tested with all four export modes. Pretty useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good but now I can't do a damn thing without it crashing. Want to delete a clip? Crash. Want to edit multiple clips? Crash. Want to add text? Crash. I expect better from Adobe and from a paid service."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Like all things adobe, when it's working well, its great, but when it's buggy, you waste hours of time trying to fix the issues. Its completely unusable for me right now. Ive edited two projects and they won't export. Projects that used to take 5 min to export are now at 5% export after an hour. Ridiculous."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Some bugs related issues, i guess. Can't connect to cloud, keep saying no internet connection. Very often system saying that app not responding, while i even not editing anything..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editing is quite unintuitive. moving something from one track to another is inconsistent and if there's even a single clip on a higher up track they get linked together and you can't interact with the bottom clip unless you move everything above it away on the timeline. and after dealing with all that after rendering the video for about half an hour the video freezes and stutters about 16 minutes in."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hello when you people are going to update this app, I am facing rendering issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gooooooood"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash after crash after crash after exporting well you can't even export so it just crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"***AVOID*** Worst video editing app, tried to use it for the past 2 years and paid over AU$590/yr after a greedy 100% price hike, a joke of a company and product. Aside from constant crashes, I cannot export edited videos to my phone, where I do some editing. Can't sync videos to my desktop, unable to export or download edited videos I have spent hours on, what a waste of time and money Adobe CC has been. User forums have pointed these issues out for years, how is this still unresolved???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Superb app.its really easy and excellent features..if you can update with photo adding feature it's good too. This was my previpus comment.im edditing it now.after update this is not working at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lot of problems for rendering in Pixel 7 Pro phone :-("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Windows version is a buggy POS that won't save, crashes and has to be restarted. Unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great for editing short video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for editing , i like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this app is supper buggy, it's frustating because I cant even complete my project without it being bugged and not saving the progress I made"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is completely useless. Editing interface is fine for a mobile app, but rendering takes more than 100x the video length (ie a 15 second video takes 25+ minutes to render) and that's IF the video actually succeeds in rendering. More often than not, after 30+ minutes of waiting, it fails. Extremely disappointed in a company that is supposedly an industry standard for this type of software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App was working okay with some bugs up until the most recent android update and now it will no longer export anything. The app has always had problems with frequently crashing but it was at least workable. Now it is completely useless and doesn't even work with sync to allow export on another non-android device. Not worth the money. Update: still have not found a solution for Android app to export any file, no matter how small. Dropping to 1 star until a fix is found."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used to be such an awesome app. Nowadays not a single render will succeed as they all freeze at the beginning. Nothing more than a waste of time these days.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing video creating app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You need an extra account for using it. I made one and didn't verify my email. And now I used it on my PC. When I tried to deinstall it, it asked me to verify my account first. What kind of scam is this. Imagine you did a typo in your mail, now you can't deinstall it hahaha. Never ever will I use Adobe apps and software again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"**SCAM App** DONT DOWNLOAD. Using brand new pixel 8 pro with 12Gb of RAM, and the app can't render a 20 second video with 720p out with 30fps. Ridiculous. Don't waste your time or money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"kinda sussy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and pro editing, thank you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"When u hit play to add a song if u don't stop the preview before hitting add the song will play in the background until it finishes this is the second time I have mentioned this if ther is a bug bounty let me know I can send u my info"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Spent ages improving a video and it was sounding good, tried to export and wouldn't work. Got a message saying there is a bug. I paid 1 months subscription and would like my money back!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As a freeeee its awesome......... Happy moodüòòü•≥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible controls on the timeline. Just plain bad.can't set times correctly. Controls are finicky. Navigation is terrible. Just overall bad for editing videos that need precision in timestamps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app does not work at all, can't export videos, keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App unfortunately broke with latest Android monthly update. Unable to export, gets stuck at 1% and crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Rush is a hit or miss experience. Sometimes it works, other times it doesn't. I've exported many videos with it, but right now for example it won't render. The progress bar will stall at some point before it reaches 100% complete. Then it sits there forever. I've tried everything I can think of but our Sun will go supernova before I can export this silly little 20 second video I made."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For a paid app, you're going to be severely disappointed. Any time you create videos it will tear and if you use their effects, even worse. Today it wouldn't even render my videos. Then when you try to get support, they just keep handing the torch off. Hate that I paid for it but here we are."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"They won't allow you to add text !! What a joke you can't edit text lmaoo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Only problem I have is when it tenders a finished project. The video has breaks and pixels missing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editing is OK but it always gets stuck when trying to render the video so the app is basically useless. Pixel 8 pro, plenty of space."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video quality is really bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I didnt know this app existed until a few days ago. Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app works well but common this is completely outdated !!! 1080p in 2024 and they charge for everything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't use the app at all as nothing will export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice editing app. Free and i have the basic control which i easily learn to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to work fine, now crashes every time it tries to render. For a professional focused company and the fact you have to pay a subscription, this really isn't acceptable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes during export! Updated the app to the latest version doesn't resolve the issue. It's broken on the latest version and previous version."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Takes a fortnite to render/export and gets stuck. Using a Google pixel pro 8."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app but desktop version is better. You can use this to get by in a pinch, however for anything remotely demanding such as 4k, you need a PC."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everything went downhill when, AI learning and the new TOS was involved"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe Rush excels in mobile video editing with its intuitive interface and robust features. However, occasional crashes and bugs disrupt workflow. Subscription costs are high for casual users, limiting accessibility. Customer support can be slow. Despite its powerful editing capabilities, Adobe Rush needs better stability, affordability, and customer service to fully satisfy users' expectations in the competitive video editing app market."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes constantly when exporting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst Video Editing App in SmartPhone. Lags and crashes a lot. I am using S23Plus, and its not able to render properly even 1080p resolution videos. Editing experience is like nightmare. I don't understand why the video plays so badly while editing. Total waste of money and time. I am a fool who bought the annual subscription plan. I have cancelled the subscription and I don't think I will get my money back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot be export at all! I have used Rush on my phone for many years, but since I changed to Galaxy S23, Rush stops working. I have tried many sign-out/sign-in , uninstall then reinstall, using a different account, esestera... nothing works. Whenever I try to export, it will show ""error, try again"" Every time! I am forced to stop using Rush, because it simply doesn't work."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This was a big let down consider how much of a forerunner Premiere is when it comes to computer editing. The mobile version is lacking on many features and the overall editing process is not as intuitive as with other mobile software such as YouCut. Also had lag and crashed with larger video files. There are a number of better apps out there."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a good video editor to get started. It crashes alot and is slow when you're fully editing videos on the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes and is buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is very glitchy and force closes constantly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for quick video editing. Super powerful and can get pretty detailed especially for a free to use app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I think I have never successfully exported a project. Always crashing at about 45%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Downloaded it, tried to render a 1 min clip and always gives a render error, what's the point of the app? To see how I ""could"" edit a video and not even export one?? Can't even render a 1 min video??"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Amazing... The last Pixel phone this app officially supports is 4 years old. Pixel 8 pro does not work with this app. It allows you to spend an hour trying to figure out the ui and then just freezes when you try to render the video out. Dear, Adobe, if you know you don't support a particular phone, maybe let the user know that fact before he spends all this time?... A simple message, when starting the app, would have been nice..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I gathered photos and videos to make one video, and this app didn't nail it at all. it couldn't render one video with 30 sec duration. shame on it. removing, very disappointed. I had to download the other app to create my video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good but if there any multiple videos edit options, then better than this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its a great quick editing tool but not very advanced. Hard to use at times and crashes... a lot. BUT better than the other alternatives as it doesn't brand stamp. It's okay."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If you want to edit more than 5 clips on a timeline, look elsewhere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Every action takes at least 30 seconds to realize, and it crashes frequently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Crashes fairly often. However it crashes the least out of any mobile video editor I have used and it will allow me to edit UHD videos at 60 fps which not all mobile editors allow. I've edited about 50 short videos on Rush. I think it's great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe used to be my fav but threatening to sue your customers for using old software is wild & why piracy is 100% justified & the morally correct thing to do at this point. I'll be deleting my accounts & moving elsewhere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Gas"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's ok, but clunky"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"After I finish exporting my first project, I keep experiencing error in saving file to disk whenever I'm exporting a diffent project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"When the video is more than 10 minutes. Render is good only in 10 minutes but Video gets corrupted after 10 minutes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for voiceover! That's what I've done so far and it was easy to do!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best mobile editing software.... Same like Adobe premiere pro pc version.... Being a video editor... I really like this software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes when you try to do anything that isn't trimming or moving a clip, won't export and randomly deletes projects, and now without the cloud sync has less capability of sharing between devices. Works well every so often but 90% of the time is me waiting for it to work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Super üíØ I Hate ADOBE Every Software, Example in Nokia End , Adobe End , Time table 2029"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cant add mp3 file. It has few things. 1/5 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"incredible video editing app, as always."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It fails at even the basic act of exporting a very simple 2-minute edit, with the edit stuck at 0-1% for hours on multiple tries. This is even with a Pixel 8 Pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Though the export quality is great, the navigation is a bit overwhelming but other than that, it is easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Every is as good as you said except one thing... Why it doesn't show to videos that I editing and also when I try to save it was black screen. Can you at least tell me what's wrong or make tutorial for me please."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very capable software!!! Very much pushing the capabilities of what a phone can do but the features are brilliant, and it does what you need it too! Very much recommend for those with proper editing experience. Not much of a pick up and play software. Only reason for not giving 5 starts is it does struggle on phones Abit, but I have only got an old Pixel 6."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't believe I pay for this app. It is absolutely awful. Glitches constantly. No longer syncs to my computer. What a WASTE. Capcut literally can do better on its FREE VERSION"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lol I thought it will ask for money but it's free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesn't work, error every time I try to create a project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App doesn't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Fiddly on phone. Not intuitive to begin with. Music choice is poor. Not worth the sub price if only using on mobile. Much better to use on desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The Adobe Premiere Rush Mobile, running on Android, is a pain, a real headache! It doesn't work as smoothly as it did before. Synchronization with the desktop from the mobile is gone! Why? I've spent the whole day trying to export my 1.15-minute work! No luck! I'm so sick of the dreaded feeling of disappointment I have whenever I use Adobe Premiere Rush! Why I even continue to bother, I don't know! It is becoming very frustrating to keep trying to fix the obvious bug!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"""Fetching Projects"" doesn't load. Loved the software when I could use it but I made 2 videos and Rush just stopped loading all together. I try to create a new video and get an ""error could not create project"". It is not usable at all, very odd."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for a ton of animations and it's been great. It's easy to learn how to use and effective. My biggest gripe is that some days when it feels like it it just spams me with crash errors even though it is not crashing and perfectly capable. It also has an extremely hard time rendering my stuff so much that it sometimes crashes 1% into the process."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not let me export videos. Why do I pay for this?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I wasted money for nothing. Would not recommend this app. I was not able to render a video. If I uploaded one and started without editing to render it stuck at 12%. Did not find a way to make it work. If I edited a video, it stuck at 4%, if I added some text as an intro it stuck at 2%. So, no chance to save a video. Pretty bad. Cancelled the subscription right away. Phone: Pixel 8 Pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can't even insert text"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Super functional, relatively garbage, why does my timeline fill 3/4 of the screen when the preview of what it displays is considerably more important?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing mid-export for a few months now. Even switching phones didn't help."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I live this app. It's fantastic. Easy to use and some great features. I just wish there wasn't so much behind a pay wall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've bee using this app for 2 years now and it is very unstable. It crashes atleast 20 times while editing and 5 times when exporting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can not rendering on the max quality, always stopping it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for quick phone editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Decent, but needs better app support."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why would you edit on a phone? If this were your only option then sure go for it. If you have ANYTHING else that can run a video editor do it and steer clear."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very convenient to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Have tried this app in multiple versions and devices here and there. It fails miserably. Controls are laggy, the interface for editing text is horrible. Only to learn it refuses to export anything. I love most adobe products, however this one is subpar to say it nicely."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dosent export its stucks at 1%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A bit of a learning curve, especially on the phone, but once you're comfortable it's absolutely amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not that good in use whiche you promote very simple and doesn't have any new"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Defective app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent and intuitive. Only gripe is there is no way to reverse a clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No (or no more) options to export for PC and finalize the edit on Premiere or Aftereffect???!!!!! Need more link possibility with adobe software OR more tool like reverse, FX, more motion option..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is trash on a Google Pixel Pro 8. Exports take over 30 minutes with the result being a video loaded with gray frames throughout the entire video making it useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is amazing, but how do we make a cut? I need to make simple trims and it would be easier to chop my clip up, then import it several times. I love premiere"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"For a free app it works very well. Wish I could do a little more in sound"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great tool for the road"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"not great, but okay. I love using abobe products. Adobe premier pro is my go to editor, as well as using photoshop. However, this made me nothing but disappointed. I like how easy to use the editor is. it is basic and practical. The only issue is the exportation side. I am being met with error messages whenever i do it. It told me to clear the cache, which I did. But then it just kept telling me that the app is bugged. Kinda disappointed with that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very hard to operate it on a tablet!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The audio on most of the files I import always plays back completely distorted and corrupted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The controls are finicky it's realy hard to get it to pinch. Touching edges will rotate the image or pull it, when you want to select something. There are a lot of sliders that should be keyboard inputs. Effects aren't where you expect them. Unintiutive. Poorly documented in app. Have made a dozen videos. Always crashes at some point or makes me start from scratch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have never been able to get this app to export a project upon completion. I have tried closing the app uninstalling the app logging in and out of the app force stopping the app and sacrificing a goat. Adobe makes awful, awful mobile apps and absolutely does not support them or take care of any bugs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It should NOT take almost an hour for this app to load files into a project that I can make in 2 minutes on Tiktok or Instagram.... All of your desktop apps are great, Adobe. Why do your mobile apps suck so bad????"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app crashes constantly. Anytime you want to trim or delete, it freezes and then shuts itself down. I've tried some of the tips to stop this, but nothing has worked. As someone who is paying for an Adobe subscription, I would expect the services to work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I post my art on social media in one minute clips with my own music and I use this to do that. I use it all day long, every day. Adobe has the most useful apps ever created."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app is the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"100% free wow. I like it. And its useful and so simple. Thanks Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All the projects created from your smartphone stay in your smartphone , you cant export them to your desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Osom"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not like this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Complete trash. I have neveranaged to get it to render anything. I even tried to render a single video without any effects at all, not even merging with another video, and it just fails every time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience, export not working most of the times. Limited functionality. No updates, no support. Paying for that is a scam."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't connect to Dropbox Constantly states that it has ""no interconnection"" Can't even load media from the device Looking for an alternative now and you should too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Running on a pixel 8 pro and it can't even render a minute long simple edit with 2 layers. Constantly freezing during render. Please fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unoptimized, laggy, low functionality piece of garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent and simple to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Necessary And Easy To Use App!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What can i said this app crashing every Second and i do have a good memory and good amount of space and it's just open and close i do not know what's going on i clean everything and i did everything that i think is we know in my work but it's crashing this app definitely do not work In my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Another waste of device space. Not particularly well done. Adobe recently hasn't put enough effort into fixing all these app conflicts and crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Running a Pixel 8, even a simple one-minute project - trim 4 seconds off a 1min 4 sec clip, add start and stop marks and place 15 frames of black at the beginning and end - and this app fails to render the project for export. Like, this is literally as basic as video editing gets: no effects, no audio, no titles. Just clip and add a half-second of fade from- and to- black --and the app can't render *that* ??? REALLY??? Zero star rating if I could - hugely disappointing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Poop maker"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loved this app but all of a sudden after months of use it just randomly started being really slow at exporting and then would just give up at 3% and say ""some error occurred"". Really disappointed as I really liked this app and nothing has fixed it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I really wanted to use this app, unfortunately It wont even import videos.. even videos i shot with my device. It is simply unuseable, however to their credit, at least I didnt spend 3 hours editing only to find it crashes on export like premier pro.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wowüò≤üò≤ It‚Äôs a good App For Video Editor. I like this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"lovely program, but after 25 minutes I have to close and reopen to continue working."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is very easy to start as 101 . It helped me back up my videos. and it is free, no advertising !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DOES NOT WORK ON THE S22, S23, OR S24... THIS APP AND ALL ADOBE APPS FOR ANDROIDS ARE A SCAM. THEY HAVEN'T SUPPORTED SAMSUNG SINCE THE S21 AND OTHER ANDROIDS EVEN LESS. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, THEY DONT CARE. DONT BOTER ASKING FOR HELP EITHER, THEIR SUPPORT STAFF JUST DIRECT YOU TO THE DOCUMENTS THAT SAY YOUR PHONE ISNT SUPPORTED."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Is this 1990? I can't even select media from an album. Basically useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes all the time on Android."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hangs on export. Preview of video is too small when color correcting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really impressed, love the features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"IM ON A GALAXY TAB 9+ AND THIS APP CRASHES CONSTANTLY TO THE POINT IT IS UNUSABLE."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app bugs more than it works ! every time I click on cut feature, the app crashs. When I try to fetch media assets the app crashs. I don't know how this is usufull for an app that is supposed to be the equivalent of Adobe premium !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Description of upgrade has 100gb of cloud storage which has been discontinued. When you go from the free Rush to the Premiere you find out the hard way. The app is not intuitive, and the chatbot does not know the product. I spent TWO HOURS just figuring out that the upgrade doesn't do any of the things that it talked about doing. Now, I've got to figure out how to cancel my subscription. Naturally, there's no convenient way to roll this back. I'll be looking for another provider."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I wanted to like this but after exporting a long video, the audio was working, but the video was choppy and kept freezing at frames. I wasted so much time on editing that video. So disappointing. I'm going back to Cap Cut ‚òπÔ∏è cap cut didn't do that. I also don't like how you have to keep zoning in so much to make finer edits. This isn't made for long videos it seems. The audio also glitches while editing which is very annoying. It's just too glitchy. I think they ""rush""ed making this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"its ehat you're looking for, trust me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why doesn't it render?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I am so pleased with the premiere Rush app. I always use this app, and it's easy to use. Thank you so much ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome Program but when I rendered a 30 min show the 2nd half was frozen in place with the audio still going does that have to do with needing to upgrade to the full version?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very basic, which is nice for phone use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is a nice video editor for quick videos. I wish you could reverse footage and have new graphics added every once in a while. Other then that it runs perfectly smooth and is easy to download a high quality video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing so much..The dialog when shown up when a app crashed or lags to give me a choice to close the app or wait is showing repeatdly even after closes..most unstable app I ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Yea it s pretty hard to use I would recommend a tutorial for beginners like me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its a descent app. I would like it to be a bit stronger like its desktop counter but it's fair if you need a quick video edit on the phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very glitches app that stuffs up every step of the way editing videos on a phone, especially rendering anything remotely complex just blocks you with errors that don't explain why it won't work. This app is a waste of many hours of your life"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Finding files is way harder than it needs to be. I just want to go into a file manager and add a recording. I shouldn't have to run all over looking for it because it tries to sort things for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have a Samsung S24 Ultra Android phone, am I not able to use this app because it will NOT install? Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why do I need to sign up?? You already have all the data just by installing you to my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Aplikasi Ribet Susah Hadeh"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is completely bricked on my phone. I have tried reinstalling and restarting over and over, but it won't load any media into projects or start anything new."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freee app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Editing is ok for an app, export just doesn't work at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awalnya agak kesulitan karena terbiasa segala instant pake capcut, tapi perlahan bisa menyesuaikan. Tolong diperbanyak lagi template text, efek juga perkaya fitur lainnya supaya makin bagus dan bisa bersaing Good job, Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsome! So similar to desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice hai"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nearly 5 stars, happy with everything but would like to be able to import from Google Photos, in other media editing apps that I've used, this is extremely useful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Disgusting üò°üò°üò°the clips automatically disappears plzz improve this waste burden"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App Keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Desaturated import. Why is the app desatyrating all my imported videos and photos?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Excellent video timeline UI. I was able to load the snapchat video, use my finger to zoom-in on the problematic frames that I wanted to cut out (trim), but guess what? No trimming function to remove the frames where the Snapchat face filter failed to be applied. An editor in its most basic form must allow you to trim, truncate, and marge/join. This App is not an editor. I can't tell you what it is. Samsung Studio is no better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"SCAM ALERT: THIS COMPANY IS A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. DO NOT PURCHASE. BUYER BEWARE."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"not running in android samsung a 23"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just tried installing on my tablet and the thing freaked out rotating back and forth. Finally had to manually shot my tab down. Yet it work fine I'm my one plus android. Guessing you don't have a version for tablets?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Just install YouCut"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"unable to open files"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on pixel..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unstable, audio constantly goes out of sync."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty bare bones compared to power director and it doesn't have landscape mode. The preview video is horrible quality to look at and no 8k exports nor bit rate Quality adjustments. I expected more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Glitches constantly. I loose videos all the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"the first video editing app that isn't capable of importing videos (normal MP4 file, pretty short and low res, 22mb in size)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"faltu"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‡¶è‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶Æ ‡¶è‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∏ ‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡¶ì ‡¶ö‡¶æ‡¶á"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Google Pixel 8 Pro here. Everything was going great for the last couple of months. But a recent update from either Google or Adobe must have messed something up. App no longer exports video. I tried restarting app and phone. I did updates for the app and phone. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app and remade the video but nothing worked."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App constantly crashes, has extreme lag, loses project states, and has audio glitches constantly. I've been trying to use this app for almost 4 years now and there are just way better options. If they actually put money into it, it would be decent, but adobe just trying to cash grab."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very very buggy. Rendered video is often choppy and video is almost completely unusable. Would be great if it was reliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All of sudden un-usably slow in export. Very limited features even comparing to other free apps. This finally made me switch and realize how much I've been missing out. Garbage app really...have just been too lazy to switch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app removes the picture in my video but leaves only the audio. How should I see what I am editing?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"There is problem for audio processing ‚úåÔ∏èü§ì"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy, but still delivers quick, professional results! Love it when I want to get something out and I'm not at home with Premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please terminate your app from this world. Your sign in process with authenticator code are irrelevant. How many millions of time should we enter the code but kept on being kicked out from using it? Please. You and your dev should jump from the avengers tower down to your grave"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Still needs better performance. Some features are better on mobile and some on pc. So far, the best app to edit in, but if you put some more effort in it, it could be the best!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Fiddly on a mobile. Getting there..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not supporting in high end mobile also."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for editing on the road. Especially in the airport in between flights"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Most frustrating app ever!!! So annoying that it's couldn't even be described. Nothing works as it should, the app is slow and full with bugs. It quits after any edits. Stops rendering. Etc, etc. Adobe, please do something! We are paying to use a service which is pretty much unusable. It's shocking and totally unacceptable! (and it has been going like this for years now...)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Completely broken."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The editing and features are good that's why I rated it 3 star but the problem I am founding is in exporting, whenever I clicked on the export button it shows to buy premium. But the overall editing experience is good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No way it takes an hour to render a horizontal 30s video. I was looking for something to replace an old editing app on my phone that has been discontinued and Adobe DID NOT DELIVER - AGAIN! I had 2 things to edit today and yesterday. Yesterday was a 6m video with phone footage and the render got stuck on 0%. Okay, maybe...too much for a phone app. (Even though I'd edit 10m videos on the old outdated app, but okay). So try to edit 30s video, renders to 2%, I take a nap, come back, & 2% still!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Solid"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice editing app and easy to work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why can't update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute TRASH. App CONSISTENTLY crashes during export, even on reduced quality settings. I am using a Galaxy S23."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"not bad. needs more tools like motion blur etc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very interesting üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"great interface for a quick mobile edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Quick Share Audio no no... Any video/audio file shared over any platform comes through with slowmo audio. No fix that I could find, even speedy audio though any app. Seriously odd. Easy to use but not for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow that easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was expecting a lot better from Adobe, functionality is extremely limited and it's difficult to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Checkin and still garbage..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is only for iPads, It's not optimize for phone üì±..!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bro this app is downloading now. I have not seen oe use it before"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Fails to render since the last update. Videos freeze while the audio continues. This was much better before the 2/28 update. Needs to be fixed ASAP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Sound syncing is ALWAYS wrong. Annoying and somewhat crucial. Other facets are good, but again: SOUND DOESN'T IMPORT SYNCED!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i hate this app it says my internet is off and ""come back and check later"" Please fix this i was looking forward to making a simple edit with this..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Error SSL connection trying to sign in with google account"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It lacks color grading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Projects are trapped locally now that you can't use creative cloud to share projects between devices, and there's no way to export project files from the app. Useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Audio desynces somehow during the rendering process"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Won't export, stuck at 2% for a 15 second video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"intuitive , powerful , quick app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I been using this for like 5 minutes but oh my gosh it's so much better than anything else I've used on android."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not working constantly loading can't start a new project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad experience.. don't install don't waste your time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far this is pretty good. Needs more overlays, transitions, all that, though -- other video editing apps have more cool stuff"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Eldtor video on YouTube last video share link once My video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to learn, I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Well, not a fan"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every piece of music I put into my videos comes out slow, until this is fixed I would recommend downloading filmora or some other video editing software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Incredibly difficult to work with, glitchy, and it makes no sense. Take it from experience DO NOT INSTALL!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Only way it could be better if it was free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's so nice and good .we expect some more features like ai blur etc...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for 4k mobile editing. Like a scaled down premier elements"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Appreciated üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"After a month, it doesn't work, and all it will day is fetching projects, and it will say that for ages, I don't know exactly how long. I liked it, but now it's useless if it doesn't show my projects's.also, I don't like how you need premium just to share my video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app is handy to have on your device for quick edits, but there are limitations. First, an internet connection is required for it to function. If your connectivity is spotty and keeps dropping in and out, the app will stall, and you will have to force close and then reopen it. Secondly, the app may lag slightly if you have multiple clip segments. Otherwise, it is a great app for on-the-fly editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's not a perfect mobile editing app, but it's pretty close. It's good for rough cut/on the go videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's okay. I wish it had transcript, caption features and also with the creative CloudSync leaving. There's no good way to transfer your work on the phone to your computer. Desktop cleanly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Low effort junk app. Want to out text over a video? Nope.. you can't edit the premade template text. I watched the Adobe Rush tutorial video.... there is no edit text button, and the comments below suggest it isn't just me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app. If it's working, it depends on your cellphone capabilities, not on your expertise."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This was so much more useful when it had cloud sync between the desktop and mobile apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Often crashes during rendering. Sometimes it just doesn't like a project and will crash half way through rendering. Sometimes it'll finally do it after many attempts. Frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Awful experience with lots of bug and low quality rendering. Waste of bytes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mainly use the app as a way to mirror videos and it does it perfectly and without any issues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I tried this app a year or so ago and it was a mess. I couldn't accomplish even the simplest of task. I downloaded it today just for the heck of it and it appears to have gone through a major update. I found the UI intuitive and responsive. The UI looks and responds like a light version of Premiere. You could actually make some decent reels with this. Keeping it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I come first time to download it but it is very heavy app ü•≤"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Couldn't get any of my video editing stuff updated on the notebook so decided to check this out since I have an Adobe account, and wow, glad I did, it's so much easier on the smart phone that I'm not going back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent, performance video editing experience, wonderful app ever.. thankyou.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not opening app in my 13.0 ColorsOS Version phone when I open the app there showing blank ?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I like the layer features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good vide editor / creator"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app would've been a great app, but there are just too many bugs, it's impossible to go through an edit without at least one or two crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What is this even for? You can't even produce a video from this practice editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Have not used it yet. Look forward to though Adobe my favorite Cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Siuu nice one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it's so hard to sign in or sign up... deleted the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I wish for better quality templates and filter üôÇ it a little slow or resource heavy compared to the other existing video editing apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best app for video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"WORST APP THERE ARE MUCH MORE BETTER APPS THAN THIS USELESS APP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app is intuitive and very stable. It provides sufficient amoumt of editing options while keepig things simple. It definitely forces me to be creative."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good one simple to use highly recommandable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great! Much better than the iPhone version for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It need more options for auto caption and audio fades"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nawet na flagowcu aplikacja wiesza siƒô co kilkana≈õcie sekund"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is still very far from a really good, user friendly app. On a phone or tablet at least. Pls keep working on it Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"2010s video editing for your phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"SAMSUNG S24 ULTRA: Great UI but lags a lot and when exporting a 1080p video I get a thin green bar at the bottom and the video at times after multiple exports is laggy/jittery..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Had to sign up for an account just to try the app, not very intuitive, waisted my time. I will not pay for something if I don't even know if it will work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just lame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always crashes when you export a video. Doesn't matter in which format you do or how many Mb has."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Buggy, slow and crashes if video is longer than 15mins"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like this app üëå‚úåÔ∏èüôåüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nearly identical to the pc version but for free on mobile, simple to use and better than any other mobile editor in my opinionüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm not much of a video editor. I use video editors just for triming and adding some effects. Everything thing was fine but after exporting the video, some random colours were added into the video. The exported video had a lot of colour glitches. Please look into this matter. Thank you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Glitchy output, crashes often."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes whenever I try to change clip speed. (100% crash rate)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy and fast to use. Very user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes everytime, either while editing, or whenever rendering a project, have never finished an edit in Rush, and it's a shame too, coz the interface is quite intuitive and would have made a pretty good v√≠deo editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for a phone app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"5 üòÄ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"so easy so good. absolutely love it. thanks for jeeping it free. it is so hard to survive as an artist. this might actually help me progress faster."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like how there's a percentage for speed and that it has the option to maintain pitch or not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I can't download this fabulous app for my Xiaomi pad. Please fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Tried to add photos, select 25 or so and it makes a short clip from 2 at random"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely buggy. Im sooo tired exiting rhe app after every single edit i make..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Your are a JOKE ADOBE!!! F F F U. I'm at NY Fashion Week trying to export a reel. Your app is crashing non stop. $50/mo for a decade and non of your core apps work properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I don't know how to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Yup! This does everything I need it to do."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èüôå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. if you try to use transitions titles, it makes the rest of the video glitchy and unwatchable. Also, when attempting to add more than 1 title overlay, if you hit backspace to get rid of the generic title, it just deletes the whole thing. worst video editing software I have tried. 0 out of 10, would only recommend to my ex-wife."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love the ease and common sense nature of it. I can edit videos on my phone!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It isnt working properly on s24+ exynos 2400 chip device it is laggy fix it please,it is working so bad that my 3 year older Phone do much faster.it is about your support..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love all adobe programs this is a good one so I can edit and put out quick while I'm at work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Seems to work great, except for the fact that it doesn't let me export anymore. The first project exported fine, second one won't export no matter what I do."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dp not install"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed, useful for minor edits and joining content."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This has to be the most unusable app I used in my life. The interface is very intuitive, however the app is riddled, and I mean RIDDLED with bugs, and because it's practically abandonware, that's probably never going to change. I have tried to use it so many times and sometimes IF YOU'RE LUCKY, the video renders and you're fine, but I have never ever made a single project with this app without SOMETHING going wrong."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Eazyy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please optimise this app for exynos-powered devices. Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good for basic editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Videos editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent so far..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great so far, no clue what im doing and learning on this program is going really well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tiles, Overlays, other graphics don't appear when they click on them and then my video clips kept glitching. For a Adobe Rush that's is suppose to be like a Mobile Pro, it's becoming a Mobile Problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio and video speed. The audio and video speed is always really fast so everything sound like a chipmunk and cannot change it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app editing with finger tips is more than enough"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Shocking. Crashes on a brand new Pixel everytime you try to delete a clipped section. App crashes for a second then gives you the wait or quit option which just stays in the way even though the app is working. This is so shockingly bad I can't comprehend it. Im not even managing high quality video or high volume. It's phone recording and a minute long. It's an app deployed on a google play store where a huge amount people have Google pixel phones, and it doesn't work on them."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app is pretty good but has 2 main issues. 1. Shortening the clips tends to be annoying because while trying to do it, I often accidentally press the clip next to it 2. Even though I have a S23 256gb, the program struggles with projects that incorporate more than a few clips While editing a 7 minute video, I got more than 20 error messages before I finished. More waiting then working."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad in Short"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good Editing app üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Please make an editing software like after effects ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è for Android devices"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Where 90 % apps get you 70% features free and 30 % paid no one will buy the full sub for this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Inam writing because in know adope team care . The app really big frustration not friendly User face very Hard to use it .. you know a alet doesnot have laptop so all we have is only android apps and adope preimer is the best but sad we are not professional to use it and donot have laptop what if you made it good like adope primer and noise reduction and effects and sound effects and transactions etc even it will be good and not free and cheap I will participate but please improve it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Totally Love it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm having trouble with this app the video image won't show to edit so please update this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ÿßŸÅÿ™ÿ∂ÿßÿ≠"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is so horrible. Keeps crashing all the time. The most shitest app I have ever used üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good kinda slow on my phone but amazing quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"10/10 experience. One of, if not the best, app of its kind."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If you so much as touch a ""premium setting"" which didn't used to be premium, you can no longer export that project and it is trapped in the app forever. There isn't even a way to buy the premium version l. It just says ""premium upgrade is unavailable"". I also subscribe to Adobe master suite, so this just tells me this app is now completely broken and unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works great for the project I work on a daily basis."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waste of time don't use. Crashes, audio rarely syncs properly, no pan or zoom for clips. It's the bare minimum and not an added benefit of premiere pro. You can split and cut clips and that's about it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm furious that I pay for this garbage. Big green line down the edge of my exported video. SERIOUSLY? FIX IT."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Still needs improvements"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It is not very easy to cut small parts out of a video and whenever I saved an edited video off of here it is always extremely laggy by the halfway point and becomes unwatchable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"its not great, scrubbing through a timeline is very choppy and ive had multiple crashes while attempting to do so i have a tab s8 so i wouldve assumed that it would play nice due to the pretty powerful processor in it but ive been disappointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It works great on my phone when I need to make something quick."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app so easy to use and make movies on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app üíìüíìüíì"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"smooth with my videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"really disappointed, app kept crashing at even the simplest things such as adjusting the video speed, and to top it all of you need to pay to export in 4k after all of the lag you had to fight through"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible to use! Clunky and buggy!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect app same as Premiere on laptop üëåüí™üëçüòò"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Suck, it's not displaying any video I just keep adding more and more but it's just a blank screen, one star, I'll stick to capcut"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very poor. Very slow and never works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lock! Will delete and reinstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to work but now nothing will render, it's stuck at the render screen for all the projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible audio. This app messed up audio of video that I recorded on my phone. I had to use a different app to cut a video for YouTube. I don't know why I am paying for this garbage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"there's a glitch that longer videos do not export with sound after few minutes. longer videos glitches on preview too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No feature stands out, and missing some features that other free apps have"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"You have add more options like kine master"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice üëçüôÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just truly loved it makes editing video on the move super easy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly. So happy for You Tube tutorials! This App is awesome for a newbie and the price is right. Definitely recommend"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it. The thing that would be a great improvenis to auto sync the music to.the clips. I have used rush on my android to edit pro videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love being able to colour correct and edit on my phone. Great app I just wish it could auto color or at least white balance"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I use this app because of some blind loyalty to Adobe but Jesus its riddled with bugs, forces closes all the time and is slow AF."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I choose Rush to edit my youtube vlogs but it was the biggest mistake of my life. Numerous problems i am facing using this app and i lost my motivation in making more videos. üò≠ I purchased this app for a year but its rubbish. Even giving it a 1 star is shameful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have been for more than 2 years now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app will eventually stop responding when you cut many parts of your video, like pauses. It runs very slowly, too. When I export videos from it, some frames come up glitchy in the final export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very poor. It's been my second video I'm editing in this app. When I was about to export, it's showing ""error saving file to disk"". I need this to be fixed immediately as it's very important file for me to export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The mobile version will never be like pc version üòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes every 30 seconds on my pixel 8 pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Was able to adjust color as i expected."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am teaching myself to edit video content and this app is very intuitive and easy to learn and navigate. It took me some time, but successfully finished a video, complete with voiceover and music. I highly recommend. Edit: After hours of work on a second video editing etc. I have been unable to finish as the app keeps crashing Everytime I try to do anything. I am so frustrated."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its a good editor especially for beginners level. Only thing its missing is be able to change the background for green scene. chroma key."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for quick videos. Works (almost) perfectly on my Samsung S8 tablet."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Upon install and payment after trial it worked well enough for me to be happy. Been trying since Christmas to open the app and it crashes. Now it's uninstalled and won't be back on my phone. But best of all I'm now out most of the year i paid for just a few months ago. Thanks Adobe. You suck!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app for all professional media editors ‚úåÔ∏èüåπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Voice lag. When I upload a video to edit it.. The voice of the video plays automatically in slow motion. I tried to uninstall and reinstall it but i am facing the same issue again and again. Please correct this error."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"$35 cancelation fees"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It does what I need it to do."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I managed to create a 5 min video and export it but it took me a very long time as when I would delete a clip it said it wasnt responding and I had to click wait about 4 times before it would delete. Now, I can't fetch my projects I created. Help!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Vary easy to yous for fast editing on phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn and use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very poor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even import standard photos downloaded from my Google Photos album. Therefore useless, so I can't comment on any other functions because I can't even build a timeline for my current photo montage needs. I've tried reinstalling it, and I am signed into my paid Adobe CC account. Shameful since Premiere is such a wonderful product, that Adobe's only video editor app can't read basic photo files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worst app. While working on mobile, any video of computer screen when exported comes with blink. I tried many times but it is the same result. Also, the process time is very long. Adobe team should work on this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Satisfied with the experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not bad for a first time user."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash all the time when export mp4, holyshxt app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Error during login"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy, intuitive, simple, yet high-powered. I have tried many other mobile editing software, and this ranks #1. 5 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am using it on Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 and it is extremely buggy app. Some reported bugs weren't corrected for more than 4 years. For example if you connect Bluetooth headphones playback speed is doubled. Very often app gets stuck and it is not possible to move clips on the timeline unless you restart it. But what makes it unusable for me, is that Adobe Rush keeps adding new clips at the beginning of sequence, not at the cursor as it should. This messes synchronisation with the underling audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app. It needs some cooler special effects, but it's okay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app..just wastage of money. I am regret the time I downloaded this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disaster, 1080p 60f max output. And I downscaled from 2.7K and the video is just very bad.... No 4K output.. what a joke from serious company like Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hung while rendering, proven useless. Just tried to export 30 WhatsApp videos imported into a sequence and 1080p had an output size of 955 MB, it got stuck at 9%. Tried changing to 720p, got stuck at 21%. Didn't expect this from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My first time and first day using this app. From the get go, bugged occur. Literally, my videos and photos wont show. Also, when it comes to videos, the audio only plays."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes often when editing, and completely unable to export anything longer than a minute."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I like this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worthless app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is the worst Adobe product I've used. It isn't suitable for even the most basic video editing. I've tried it on my galaxy tab s8+ and my note10+ and it is a poor experience either way. It crashes, the interface is poor and the menus are glitchy. Don't even think about 4k. It can't handle the files. Instagram in app video editor is far better. You would think the would understand the demand for mobile editing and want to protect their premier pro customers as they migrate."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"First app I came across on either iOS or Android that caused the screen to constantly go from portrait to landcape. The only way to get use of my Lume Pad 2 was to reboot. Well adobe!done!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Too good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quite a nifty lite version of Adobe's Premier Pro. Has the bells and whistles I need."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"hard to learn, and lacks some simple features. I try to cut the top and bottom of a simple film, and than trim few seconds from begining and finish. no luck"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps freezing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am adobe family user but Unfortunately, I've to discontinue this adobe rush in 2 days of it's 3 days free trail. I'll definitely come back if the app crash issue will be fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The audio just gets lagged pls solve anyways i am shifying to a good editing software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Never used it before but needed to do an audio dub on a slide show movie I had made. This app was so intuitive and efficient to use. Quite amazing to be able to do all I need on my just my phone ! Incredible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. Using it already several years... so kudos to the team and perhaps some update would be good as well - mainly for social media posts etc. Make it a bit faster and perhaps some AI assistance would help also. Just as an additional tool. Cheers ü§üüèªüç∏ü§üüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I use my YouTube, Facebook video editing. And I have one problem slow network this application slowly working, better to wifi connection use this application so good üëçüèª video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"can you add audio formats please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After adding more than a couple clips it's extremely laggy and keeps crashing. Unusable in its current state."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"For some reason, this app no longer lets you download projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice and simple but even after all these years and updates, it still glitches out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Niceü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic features. Easy to use. Perfect for spontaneously creative minds. üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can't do nothing in it, the pointer even with pen jumps wherever it wants etc , useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sound issues all the time..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Buggy. Things are messed up in UI. I can't add audio files amidst the editing except choosing them from the start. Presets are incapable. Looks ugly in every aspect. Installed it for the name, leaving it being disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"doesn't have a reverse clip function, as well as missing tons of other effects. literally why are we paying y'all so much money when you put less effort into your apps than the free video editors in the store."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"login problem brust app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Crashes frequently. It'd be handy to allow full screen playback within the app to check editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Working on a Pixel 7 pro so my processing power is great also.... Saved so much time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never wants to work literally just updated and it crashed 4 times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The confidence Adobe has creating this app and uploading it to play store lol"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Useful editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this app is literally hot poopoo. i remember 3 years ago i used this to edit a 1 minute long video and i never finished it because it kept crashing after every little action. that was on a s10 plus. now on a s23 plus and THE SAME EXACT THING. useless, if you couldnt get it right by now then you never will."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Kuchh kam ka nahi ,capcut hi sahi hai"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Learning to use Rush has been a great time. It's getting me ready to use premier when it comes that. It's a solid app to have."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Update: last update seems to have resolved the issues (for now) will update my review accordingly. I would give 5 stars but it's happened multiple times that an update has messed everything up and had to wait till next update."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Get davinci over this overprised buggy pos"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for on the phone on the go projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and really helps me get some quick material out the door. Adobe is the best!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have the Samsung flagship and it still lags. ""App stopped working"" notifications go up numerous times while trying to edit small details. Unless you have A LOT of patience, this is not a functional app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It keep crushing and errors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Main screen is not showing so tell me how i edit any video..ü•∫"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Many bugs, just terribly frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this app is noob"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Constant crashes. Very limited free uses. Struggle to export my video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Some features are extremely difficult to use with the touch UI. Other things like the overlays, titles and graphics are either broken, non-functional or so difficult and unintuitive to use that they might as well be non-functional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Email ,log in .password , bla bla bla Not interested No hassle app much better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the app I've been waiting for. Makes it so easy to get that content just right! Still loving it a few months in..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and quick to learn"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Extremely well designed and easy to use. It takes a few minutes to learn but it is very convenient and helpful. Also zero ads at all. Recently though, it has been consistently not working. It just does not play the video. It could be that it takes a long time to load, but that still would be a con."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why the app keeps crashing on me. It's not fair cause I'm a student, and I'm trying to complete a school project, making the editing process longer for me to complete"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It work well, Thank you Adobe team, this is number one video editor in the world"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"i am using this for stop motion video, it's very handy and really quick. so far is ok for my stop motion works. cant imagine using pc conventional software, couldn't replaced this instead"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"some good tools, but on multiple devices I can't get the audio and video to sync right, which makes cutting virtually impossible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I hope there is a upscaling a video like noise reduction feature. To look it like more HD."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"very unstable, rendering is just pain"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"P√©simo para renderizar en 4k, KineMaster es mucho mejor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Is doesn't work at all you can't even see my Media all you see is a black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Another useless app from adobe. Can't add my own audio tracks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm paying over $60 a month? For this? Please... How is this the best Adobe can do? I'm sorry to leave a stinker review but this is barely usable, even on an s21 ultra I'm unable to completely render a 3 minute video at the 720p 30fps. How???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"KEEPS CRASHING"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why adobe why you made this app...?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app and best part is there are no adds and unwanted watermarks. Works seamlessly even with some basic knowledge. Keep it up."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Always getting error while render and export really bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love the software it has enabled me to learn how to edit on my desktop computer and on the go using my cellphone. It's off the hook and I highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn editing in general."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Does a reasonable job editing videos on my Pixel 7. Considering the limitations of working on a phone I'd say the app performs very well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Editing ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ,‡§™‡§∞ transitions ‡§•‡•ã‡§°‡•á ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§≤‡§ó‡•á ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á & application ‡§ï‡§æ‡§´‡•Ä ‡§¨‡•á‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§π‡•à‡•§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Still learning ask me again in 10 days."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not worth the extra $35 per year. Missing so many critical features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect mobile video editing app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly, videos do not upload to the cloud consistently, borderline unusable on the S23."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"good but it keeps saying not responding anytime it lags. its annoying to click the box each time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it! Worked as expected!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Phasing black screen problem in video preview section in my oppo device please solve this problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"absolutely terrible! loaded some photos and an audio clip to create a memory for Instagram and the audio plays in slow motion by default, with no option to delete it without deleting the entire sequence and no option to speed it up either.. very bare bones with no features whatsoever, premier sucks everywhere, whether on PC or android!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb I am professional video Editor as 10 yrs experienced same in desktop feelings is given me as premiere pro to premiere rushüëçüëç Thank you Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best and simplest out there on mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is brillient app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The only app that i have almost complete control including audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pitiful, just pitiful. I can't even create a project because there's nothing showing. I want a refund."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I was very comfortable with the previous app. That it just one day disappeared & I had to learn another app on the fly. Worse, the fact that it was the only reason I signed up in the first place. I like the Adobe products. I just feel off now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is not available for many android phones"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I want to add just basic text in a lower third without all the colorful gimmicky BS. And why does my watch literally get 153 push notifications every time I export something."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very very easy and user friendly app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why does this even exist on Android...completely garbage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app quality is too good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I was excited to use this app but it has major flaws. The software that comes with my phone is much better which was dissapointing for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow very nice Tha app is god Cool editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is crashing all the time. As soon as I start editing the error appears saying that app is not responding with options to wait or close the app. If I choose ""wait"" the same message pop up every 10 seconds, even I close the app. Device used - pixel 8 pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I keep receiving error messages telling me to purchase Creative Cloud to access a specific codec, even though I already subscribe to creative cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Iam fan's for adobe collocations,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Glitchy. Chopping up audio and moving around too much makes the track skip. It's good if you're in a hurry though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for video editing on mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app got much better ! I like that you can see the music track now. It's also quite simple to use which I appreciate. My only concern is that it gets quite slow the more you add videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I love this app when it works, but lately it has been crashing on me. If I could get a fix for this, it would be a 5-stars. There should also be a feature to reverse time in a clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience...very good for the job of editing videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This video may be good for editing and making videos, but for some reason, it's not importing the video clips that I want to use, I hope you guys can fix this issue, otherwise I highly recommend it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is great for all of my work but does have a problem with force closing. Other then that good stuff"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app kept closing out making it so I couldn't even try to use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Pixel Fold problems, never had a problem with this application but as soon as I switch to my pixel fold the app never run correctly. That phone will get hot and the editing wasn't as smooth as I'm used to in other tablets."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Had a great experience editing a video on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra). Wanted to also edit on Windows PC so I purchased the Premier Pro which is required to edit same project on desktop version of Rush. It was fairly costly. Had an issue syncing the assets to the cloud and supports answer was that the S23 isn't supported. What a crock."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Love this app on my Pixel 6 pro, however, it has an issue playing videos in editing and rendering always fails due to an unknown error on my Galaxy s23 ultra :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its a beautiful experience a very nice app not as spectacular as Premier Pro itself but it's really nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Rush is very laggy on Android / some of the controls tend to not function when interacted with. It basically isn't the most responsive with touch controls. Seems pretty buggy, but it'll end up doing what you need once it's done lagging / being non responsive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best app for video cutting and added multiple videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Embarrassingly bad, doesn't even support AVI files, come on"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio won't load properly, video glitches, delays in input response... I paid $50 for this piece of junk app, I'm very disappointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe has apparently collapsed under the pressure of maintaining its position at the apex of the visual digital arts software production sphere. I will now say they are complete and total idiots, who are not only stupid, but moronic as well. Seriously. There aren't even words for what I just experienced when trying to learn how to use the video editor. Pick yourself up off the floor, Adobe!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Has alot of features. Im still new, but so far, has all the feature I expected"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is poorly optimized. Very annoyed because Adobe is known for having top level editing software and this one is a piece of Garbage. Why does Canva have a more Intuitive video editor then you guys? I can make a video to promote my business, and it looks amazing on Canva without having to jump through 1 million hoops and it's much faster and more efficient. I try to use you alls video editing and it crashes, is not user friendly at all. There are free apps that are better then this trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Bagus. Easy to use. Hanya perlu ditambah fitur agar lebih menyenangkan ngeditnya."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So glad it's finally available on Android. Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Love adobe on pc but wanted to do this so I could resize videos between tiktok and YouTube. The app will play sound on video but only shows first frame in playback window. I'm using and s23 ultra so processing power shouldn't be the issue. Would love to see performance of the app fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"As soon as I opened the app, it's the same predatory BS from Adobe. Terrible company, terrible app. One star, uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done fast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The application is good but want some updates ... it's user experience is little bit complex for first time users and should have a trimming option and export quality choosing option . Otherwise app is good üëç ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Kinda wired but u can do some things."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Close, but no tamale. When it's working, it's great. But there are constant freezes, glitches, and restarts that make the overall experience frustrating. It is extremely powerful and I've edited great videos on it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App doesnt show any videos i drag in from gallery"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Expected a better app from adobe!!! Can't zoom in while editing. Not much user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't export. Adobe should be ashamed of themselves for charging a monthly fee when they can't even create an app that works properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app for making little family films. It is very user friendly. It is a little glitchy when I add a lot of videos, but still a wonderful app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very flexible app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday super easy...love love love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simply great!üëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It has some issues, there is a lack of features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not smoth for android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The UI needs A LOT of work, there are features I would expect and a level of intuitive ease of use that is lacking."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have barely used this app, but I'll be honest. I expected worse from Adobe, but I was pleasantly surprised. I expected an app that wouldn't let you do anything without paying a monthly fee like everything else on the Play Store, but this seems like the best free simple video editor that there is."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a good program. But the videos pf the lessons are not opening."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's pure stupidity than nowadays you can't move a soundtrack in Rush anymore. It used to work fine, but the past year Rush just is bugging. Also, I don't really understand why rush needs to create cache files that fill up your phone, that you can't delete."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's slow and it needs effects like chrome key and masking to kick up the slow moving experience it freezes often and now for some reason you decided to nickel and dime for what is already super lame assets. üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Barely more capable than instagram"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst video editing app I have ever used never expected low or cheap quality product from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I hate that you can't zoom in on the video. Trying to add captions on the phone is a nightmare because if you mistype, hard to backtrack. My fingers would try to retype a word, but mis-tap on another part of the sentence. It's very frustrating. It's also very slow at times and has terrible loading times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Premium version: can't even export a project in 4k because it always crashes. Nice UI tho, but ultimately useless as it is"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Recently reinstall this app. after that voiceover not working.... voice not recording... Subscription amount totally loss to me.... i checked Mic but it's working properly.... Voiceover function working in other apps well... so i unsubscribed... my subscription money totally loss to me..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"An absolutely terrible, buggy mess. Would hang, randomly slowed a 30 fps clip down to half on its own. Couldn't render even one thing. My phone isn't new but I'm using an S21 Ultra. I mean the app should be somewhat functional no? Very disappointing from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is not installing on my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Only a couple times very intuitive and for me a creator on the go it's pretty damn good. Goes with my Adobe cloud package included that's just awesome! Seriously ever time I think I need to buy something else Adobe has it ready to go!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Outstanding. Wish it had key frames."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing all the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm not a fan of subscriptions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe spokespeople online say the export limit for free version is a thing of the past and yet here I am facing the same LAME paywall. Please tell me there is a mistake"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a small part other full version but it works so"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app works when it wants to. Which is about half the time. It's constantly freezing up and although it has great video and audio effects its a pain to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy and useful, I love it üòÉ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"all are saying this app is bad but to be honest this app is not for boys this is for men"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes, limited features, even more basic than that awful Capcut in some ways. Cannot take more than a handful of clips until it crashes. Awkward UI that requires silly pinch zoom a lot, cutting simple timelines is difficult and cumbersome, frequently used features and tools are buried. Limited encoding options. Overall terrible app with few redeeming features and most of those apply to Adobe CC subscribers. Needs a total overhaul IMO."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for editing my YouTube shorts videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"100% BEAUTIFUL üòç‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good express program with little cost. Thanks for the concerned editor on a rush!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This tool should use the space between primary and secondary storage, i am facing problems to render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Major Flaw... my projects will not save to my device! The editing is great, seamless, and pretty easy to adjust to. The only problem is that projects won't save to my phone nor can they be shared to other apps (IG and YouTube)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Fundamentally broken - don't waste precious hours working on a project as this app crashes on export every time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No sure if this is a joke. Can't access phone filesystem. Can't even get to files to add to project. Non-starter"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Cool that it exists, but it could be more user friendly..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't have most features ,even a basic feature like masking! Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad Apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"GARBAGE NEED GMAIL ACCOUNT TO LOGIN"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and straight forward"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"THE BEST!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's good. Certainly better than not having any Adobe editing on mobile, but...it would be way better if you could make simple key frames."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"There is no stabilizer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exciting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app out there."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The idea great the UX UI good enough but it's stuck all the time and many error even in different devices. Save half and many double parts. Total mess, tried for two projects and took me double time. Maybe good for less than 10 min videos and no big files of standard quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Love the Adobe brand but hate the fact you always have to login"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Exports dont work anymore, freezes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mong mama"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app I have ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is not for professional work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not too happy but has a few good features. Performance of the app is bad. UI response, loading clips is laggy and the media browser takes a long time to show thumbnails. The UI is basic and easy to use in some aspects, and complicated in other aspects. It would be more usable if it was more responsive. Also feature set is limited compared to other editors eg YouCut. But it does have a few features that some other editors don't have. Considering the cost and that it's subscription I'm not happy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing on android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Z Fold5 Terrible experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good, let's add some AI features too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Exporting any high quality video over 5 mins freezes the visual but keeps playing the audio. If you choose your quality you may be able to get a video to 10 mins before it starts to freeze. Great in theory but doesn't work as intended."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It needs proper upgrades ... its been. Glitching for the last year"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"ÿß€åÿ™ÿ≥ ŸÜÿß€åÿ¥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Still a complete mess of an app. Why can't you figure out how to fix all the bugs when exporting video? Juddery video, jumping, artifacting, really reduced quality..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is a POS it barely runs, and I know this is the case because I've had 2 phones by 2 different makers and run into the same issues or it not being able to import or export clips. This the worst app I've ever used. I've never had an app so consistently not function for me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very simple and for a free video maker it's very complet."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for editors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app stops any time.. some times don't save videos,sometimes stops opening .. I hv lost my projects 2 times already due to such glitches"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and quick"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptional."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"1st. Thank you for a great opportunity to work with your application. I have great plans for video editing. Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Hanging and when you add tittles or overlays hard to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"We need clip splitting but this was pretty quick to learn."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Quite good for editing...would love it more if more advanced features are there"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Best Android video editing tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It either works great or crashes every ten seconds. When it works, it's pretty useful, especially for cross-platform editing, but when it doesn't it makes me want to throw my phone across the room..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love using this‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, I love using photoshop and premiere pro on my laptop,but this app is awful. The editing is fine, preview is slow to load but I can forgive that. The issue is exporting. Sometimes it just doesn't export at all, it destroys the quality of your video and the options for exporting suck, you can't really change anything. Not happy at all, changing to a different app. If I didn't use photoshop on my laptop so much I would cancel my adobe subscription just because of this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Once you learn it, it's a wonderful app that allows us to express ourselves freely and creatively."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"""Error saving file to disk"" makes this now unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Problematic. It used to work. Now all videos I import in are inexplicably slowed down with distorted pitch, and the audio no longer matches the video. That's not happening in other video editors."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Smooth"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience, even on top-end hardware. Absolutely non-functional for even the must basic of tasks. Do not use this app, there are many superior alternatives."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Lack of important features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Needs Auto captions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good app that has pretty much everything i need to edit on my phone. Only problem is it takes a long time to load and freezes constantly whilst editing. The exported video also sometimes has glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Delete button doesnt work and app crashes, refund not approved"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good Quality exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Once you learn how to use it, is fabulous for quick video editing from your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I will give it 5 star if no lags and glitches, this app works great in Iphone. When I switch to android phone it lags like crazy and slows down my edits, I wish there is a solution for this. I will uninstall soon once my subscription ended."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Like all adobe programs.. Good and solid Why 1 star? because i pay for Creative Cloud for 10+ years, and now, on this day, they changed that you have to pay extra for using this app in 4k.. Hello Capcut!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing for anyone who wants to edit quickly on phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update: Keeps crashing Can be much better This app has a great potential, regarding transitions please get inspired from the official DJI Air app. I also missing a reverse speed as is in adobe premiere Pro. Very often I just need a fast edits to my drone footage and if those features will be added I'll be able to do it on my smartphone in Rush. I am subscriber to Adobe CC and would like to stick with it also on mobile, but with those missing features I have to use third party editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded this app and uninstalled it within 5 minutes. It's not working properly. I separated the audio from the video, and it again showed the video and audio attached after it was done. Also, all the clips went blank. And kept happening again and again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Please add support for HEVC"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Using it on phone and combining it with VN editor, definitely getting the best results for phpne"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"1. lacks important features (split clips, fx, overlay, etc) 2. glitches on video export (normally i have to export 2-3 times before it gets it right) 3. clunky, slow UI (they tried to dumb it down but accidentally made it difficult to use) i would recommend trying to find a free third party video editing app that works for you. Rush has a long way to go before it could compete with other available video editing apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Seriously, how does this thing work? This is nothing like Premiere. 0 tools - & Pixel 7 pro screen sensitivity makes it difficult & time consumming to do anything. Please rename to All Thumbs or AP Slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"4K video is not rendering,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Lag"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love the app and how user friendly it is. The reason I'm not giving it a 5 at the moment it's because it still lacking some features, like time reverse, masking just to name a a few"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This video editing app is not friendly refund my payment 1700 Pesos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for short posts of products."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes on exporting and simple video. Have not been able to export successfully despite being a paying customer."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Option not available"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Installed then quickly uninstalled after testing. Audio tracks limited to only using their provided tracks in the app. No ability to add your own."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wow, that was annoyingly bad. One generous star, as I swiftly uninstall"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuttering and flickering in the final render. Worst worst worst. Dont waste your time editing the final render is absolute trash."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes every 30 seconds. Editing a 12 minute video and every 30 sec it says its not responding. It's a pain."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So slow, crashes constantly. Used to think it was nice to have for quick clips on the go but now it's so bad I end up wasting an hour trying to get it to work for something that should take 15 minutes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's actually pretty good besides different experience on Samsung You can't zoom in on fonts. It's better to use on Ipad or tablet"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App ! Nice Program ! Very easy to use to make a movie, Thanks !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash 80% of the time and doesn't save my work. Hope they fix it so I can increase my star rating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disappointing. I bought a new Xiaomi Rednote 12 and Rush doesn't work on it. I used to use Rush a great deal. Now I will have to look for another. Boo!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to signin and signup.. waste app. I don't recommend to any user."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exporting and rendering a project is always a nightmare. It always crashes during this procedure"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Probably the worst phone editing software in the world. App has really limited options. Can't even adjust and edit text properly in this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bomb Diggity Bomb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Make something easily but then you cannot export it. Tried easily 10 times and each time it fails to export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesnt even show the vid I'm editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worthless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"2023 and Adobe has no professional and reliable video editing app on Android so it is left to other apps like lumafusion. Don't waste your time on this unreliable disappointments. How is Adobe supposed to be the industry-standard if they are not leading the industry with innovative apps that solve professional workflow problems?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Wonderful experience but I need to be able reproduce videos that are not glitchy all the time Nd be able to add my own songs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use for a novice video editor. Much better than YouCut; not as easy to use, but much better results."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's freezing all.the time after I upgraded to the premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why is it so hard to do basic things?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is one branded company wilhich is killing itself with more complicated non user friendly (add bad pricing, also) products in this AI generation. Soon, it will vanish from the market."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it keep initialising and crashing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Can't render in 1080p. Crashes and simply says: ""Some error occurred"". Some error?? Nice one Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and now charging for premium adobe users to pay monthly/yearly to export 4k from phone? Ridiculous. Fix rush first and add more features. This just made delete this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I managed to create a video edit fine, but it constantly crashes while trying to export!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works great for creating on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty easy to use. Could use a few more tools. And the worst of all export always has something wrong with it. Audios always out of sync. Little glitches and stutters in audio and sometimes screen tears"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A bit basic but it does the job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute nonsense üò° Negative five star. Inshot is much better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crashes every time on export. Total waste of time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm left a bit flabbergasted quite honestly..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst editing app that I have ever seen in my editing life mainly this rush version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good but audio should have more options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good appüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely stunning app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is not compatible with my Galaxy 23 ultra I just upgraded for the better camera and now I can't edit on my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I will not give you my personal information"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It doesn't work well on android, everytime i render it stuck in the middle,when the rander is finished i find out the video works only 15 to 17 mins of the beginning out of 53min clip..but in ipad works very well and randers very fast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"They could have made it just a little more messy and unfriendly to use. Any roadside developer could have (and has) done this better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This by far is the best mobile video editing App. üî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice interface and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App is so incredibly slow and buggy to try to load, but otherwise does a decent job once it's running."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good editing software, especially for beginners. I recommend this for anyone who is looking forward to editing their projects. But i gave it 4 stars because I need to upgrade to premium to use most of the features. Please add a feature that will allow you to add your own audio"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Alright, New Rating!! The app is much better, but still, you haven't added a search section so I can find a song or audio track I want to add faster from my audio files. You have it for titles but not for audio. Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app! It is intuitive and delivers exactly what I want! Because of the built-ins, it is very easy to record a quick video, edit it, export it, and upload it to YouTube very quickly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Marvelous"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A great way to edit my content on the go 100% recommend this app just need to learn about it a bit then you can easily operate this software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing üòçüòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What's the point of this app if it doesn't sync all your Gallery albums üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gute"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Epic, fast, easy, reliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app has become progressively worse over the past several years. Audio sampling has been total garbage for over a year now with no signs of being fixed. As a matter of fact, every Adobe product suffers from this same scenario: releasing an incomplete, useless product with a couple glitzy photos used purely to onboard new customers, and they never bother to fix anything. This is the definitive year I will finally cancel my Adobe subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video glitches after rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app can still earn more without payment subscription like premiere pro..this could be home video edit app.. At least it can be made that way... View of an engineering artist and singer with business model"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn and use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First editing application without any premium charge"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Every video I make turns out glitchy after save on mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Haven't used it enough to give it a real fair assessment but just in the 10 minutes I've been editing it's very super easy to learn."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have an enormous amount fun using this app it's quite power and yet so easy to use! I do wish there were just bit more voice editing options for de Essington and mouth clicks nothing too involved though because overall it's amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is just handy and exceptional handsdown üëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly good, intuitive and fast. Didn't expect to be able to do so much, so well, just on a phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow, freezes all the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fineeeeeeee"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Real adobe premiere pro is better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Still trying it out but seems worth it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant render clips, just crashes the app. Rendering this app completely useless. Sad. Sony xperia 1 III Android 13 Edit: still doesnt work months later."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very good for editing despite how simple it can look"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"PC version is better than phone, some audio bugs on PC make it less than optimal for anything but super basic projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"An Amazing Editing App!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waste of money!!! it can't even handle 720p"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible user interface, unexpected from Adobe. They must discard this application and rebuild it. Adobe needs to learn from other mobile Video Editing apps PDirector etc"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super cool üòéüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Slow, clumsy, and incredibly lazy. For an app that requires an expensive Adobe plan for full features, this is the most poorly made popular mobile video editor. I'm a Premiere Pro and After Effects power-user and TikTok has 1000x better editing features than Premiere Rush. The exporting is free of problems on good phones, I will give them that. But I really can't find anything to be positive about with Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like everything about it but the weirdest thing is that I can use it my old tablet while not able on Samsung galaxy s22 ultra. My tablet has low ram and 64 gb storage while Ultra has 256 gb storage with 12 gb ram, its just nonsense. I will never understand this. Aside this, very smooth and fits perfect with tablet, gives you the feeling like you are on pc. Well done. Just, pls fix that nonsense with the s22 ultra thing, many people are annoyed by this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't have ai support or ai features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is terrible,no matter what phone you use it! I cannot believe, Adobe, a big name struggling like this. Do not waste your time with this app guys."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy To Use And Tool Good Dely Editing Videos my favorite Videos Editing app so really üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It app is amazing for videos editing.It support all types of features that all editors want.I am happy for its video quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When it works, it's fun and easy to use for quick editing. However, that's like 1 out of 6 projects I work on. Most of the time,the media quick menu freezes or doesn't work ,I have to use the drop down, also the media overlays and such won't load into the time-line even though it shows it downloaded from Adobe. Moving on to the fact that sometimes the audio would move a head even though it shows sync up. Lastly, when exporting it out for some reason, anything past ~15-20min would be laggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is not working. i thought this app have 4.6 or something that's why I installed this app but it didn't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A gem. Try it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Won't even start up."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Always been a fan of this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too poor and not flexible for basic editing. Hard to believe tha Adobe has this crop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"When trying to use ""speed"" it crashes. Please fix. Samsung 23 ultra."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Doing text overlays doesn't work well and is annoying. Cutting video clips also has problems trying to drag the edge"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Classic for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I don't know enough about. This stuff"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very Bad App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app has been fantastic but hasn't let me make a single edit for the passed two days. I don't know if it's their servers but I can't even trim clips anymore at this point. Hope they fix it I love this app I hate having to delete it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad app, because when I replay the edited portion, the video and the song not going with sync, which the way I make, its a damn app, I loss my time and I couldn't finish my video, I install this app because of it is a Adobe's app that's why but it give me loss of my time and effort and one more thing this app is not even to get 1 star, I gave this one to put review"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"An excellent video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"We need more features and easy way"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This apps is gud , easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It was easy working on distinct features bt little tough to deal with adding text. If possible please make adding text a bit easy and effective. The title graphics didn't work even after clicking it twice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A very powerful and easy video editing app thanks Adobe üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes on export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have been a professional video editor for 10+ years and this is an amazing program to have for you phone. Yeah, it's not fancy and as advanced as the desktop version. But for quick on the go videos for short form this is quickly becoming my preferred editor for my pixel and I'm going to add it to my iPad next. Love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Fully bakwas app...faltu, after buying premium subscription still having bug and too laggy that I can't edit a video properly..this apps needs some bug fixing updates..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best video editing app on mobile I have ever used so far. It's good but they have to improve on sound, there isn't enough sound to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not work with mp4 files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"In order to use this app you must have Adobe Premiere pro membership (in my case I have it), on the other hand the app is great not as good as the desktop version, but very helpful on the go for short videos, the app crashes if you got too much memory on your phone that is not being used for Adobe Rush, the editing is pretty easy to use for the most part, I think it's better than other free moblie video editing apps, comes with great features such a music, sounds and effects, Great App love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's so expansive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible app, making video in 4k longer than 20s is almost impossible due to app crashing all the time, in 1080 its still bad as well. I use to make shorts for my YouTube, but its super frustrating and my phone is maybe not absolute top model (Samsung S20FE 5G) but its far from middle or low end phone so it has enough capacity to handle this, so issue is with the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seems really good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great but always room for improvements"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Op"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"(I'm not a professional creator) Does the job. Crops, trims, stitches, stretches, squeezes, speeds up, slows down, sound editing... very nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App keeps crashing. Music is mediocre. Easy to use and give lots of options for editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's fluent, works as expected and does most of the jobs required."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"For my first project it was nice, but for the second project it keeps crashing and that's annoying! Especially after some hard work and time spent on choosing and trimming videos. I'm forced to try a new app, unfortunately."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Verify easy and quick to edit short videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than premiere pro and its free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A perfectly intuitive end-to-end mobile video editing solution. üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"In the middle of working with the program, it hangs and exits the program. After adding a few videos, the speed decreases drastically"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This has to be the absolute worst video editing app on the market. I've used this app on a galaxy note 20 and now I'm on a galaxy z fold 3 which is much more powerful yet the app performs the same way years later. Constant glitching, qnd lagging from the smallest movement on the timeline. It gets worse by the day I just spent 15 minutes editing a video and somehow the audio just disappeared. Adobe should stick to computer products because this app is absolute trash. Waste your time if you like!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, and easy to use üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"√é»ôi face treaba foarte bine. Am testat toate func»õiile »ôi merge impecabil. Pentru cei care se plang, dacƒÉ vre»õi sa edita»õi »ôi sƒÉ exporta»õi √Æn 4K, asigura»õi-va ca telefonul dispune de suficienta putere de procesare."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Full of glitches when exporting longer videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"amazing and easy to learn editing fkr videos and has made me lose my fear of working on videos and has given me a creative kick!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Tiene herramientas intuitivas de usar, pero un tanto limitadas."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Baap hai sab editor ka"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It is pretty easy and useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Khatara"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good. but ‚úÇ cutting not esay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very accurate in rendering, fast and easy to use. Unfortunately the app have very small list of audio files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really good and helpful software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It would probably be the best video editing app, if it wasn't for the annoying fact that it crashes EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to export a video. It all sounds very promising, lots of powerful tools and features, it can easily be a 5 stars app, but needs fixing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to exprot video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very poor app. 1 star only to post my comment"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This.makes editing videos soooo easy on my phone or laptop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best application for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy and robust. No effects.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üî•üëçü§ñ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dooont use this app This is the best capcut here"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible. I downloaded the app and it kept switching from landscape to portrait even though my screen was not on auto rotate. I couldn't even sign in because of this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is crashed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst ever. App not working finely. The video was uploaded but it wasn't running the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"V Good Video Editing mobile app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Videoyu aktarmƒ±yor bile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app but a one major issue for me. The pan/zoom feature absolutely did not work when I paid for the pro version, so I switched back to the free version but still use it for general editing tasks. If they fixed the issue, I would use the full version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very helpful software, I like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love Adobe softwares ü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm creatively hyped up and happy to produce creative, professional, powerful videos, visuals with Adobe Premiere Rush, thank you for your love your charity giving us this free version. I love your products so much when the opportunity is right I'll upgrade to Premiere Proü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"didn,t work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good for editing. Just try it. It's good for YouTube bye"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Does what I want."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I would give this one a five-star due to how easy it is to navigate, but the cons far outnumber the pros. This app crashes every five minutes, and you can't review your video without it lagging. I've tried to make it work because I didn't want to download another app, but I wasn't worth it in the long run because it wouldn't let me export my video that I spent 8hrs+ on. In the end, I had to screen record my project, and it came out with horrible quality. Don't recommend it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app for quick edits"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Could be great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Muito bom"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When I try to edit a long video, I cannot hear the sound, it becomes just some distortion sound. Please fix this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's good in a pinch but i had to lower my review to 1 star because it's 2023 and this app still doesn't have the ability to chroma key making it essentially useless in the long run. Sure i can suggest to have it added but I'm wasting my breath because nothing happens and now i have to pay for a different service just to get the chroma key feature"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Iran fine during the trial but the problems started imediately after I purchased the app (freezing, unresponseveness, blocked menues)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Too simple. Not much effect. No stabilizing capability. Dissappointed. Back to Capcut haha"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It very easy to use My 1st day review It's not a professional review"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Premiere pro, but on mobile!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"such a small window for the video itself. almost impossible to edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its good enough please add auto captions its will be nice.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"All the clips automatically link to each other. Absolutely annoying"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app. It takes time to get the hang of it. But it works. I wish I could see audio levels which would help me with knowing where to make cuts."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Well, it's better than nothing ü´¢"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes constantly. Galaxy s-pen causes the app to freeze and no longer accept touch input. When removing a photo or video from the app timeline or slicing a video into 2 pieces the app lags for 5-7 seconds. Constant app is unresponsive pop-ups telling me to close the app. If I select wait, the app unfreezes eventually but when continuing I keep receiving constant error messages. Galaxy s23 ultra. Sm-918w. Android 13."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great functionality using mobile or desktop versions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The UI is easy to work with for basic editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash. You blew it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I Enjoying using the app because its easy and user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good for early creators"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This makes my job so much easier! Editing video is, for the most part, fairly easy. That being said, I can crank content out almost immediately."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Upload speed too slow. If Phone screen off Upload stop. Without Upload your data you can't render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience very leggy....improvement needed urgently"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Has the potential but exported footage is always contains distorted/pixelated artifacts. So not recommended!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Music got me copyrighted on YouTube"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Usable, good color presets, but rather clumsy interface..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Completey updated, uninstalled, and reinstalled, and this app is complete garbage. It always crashes, it barely exports video. Best use for it is getting my footage on my pc quick."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best alternative, if you dont have laptop and want to edit guick video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Formerly 1 star because of the relentless crashing, but I'm happy now. I use it sparingly just so my luck doesn't run out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing if hou have better configuration device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"$100 fee to cancel your account. Adobe is a massive scam. Stay away. Much better (and more friendly) products are out there."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even change duration of slides!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just the right app for quick edit on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Undeniably the most valuable, and reliable editor on mobile. Worth supporting. (Dev note - A single, affordable, crossplatform subscription which includes all practical features would encourage us to completely migrate to Adobe for all our media, and content creation purposes.)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"quick video edits. nice UI. better features. all good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I get the distinct impression this app was developed by 2-3 people over a period of several weekends (at most) before it was released completely untested by humans. Seemingly satisfied with the result, they abandoned any further attempts at improving it, adding features or making any existing features work properly. Since then it's (only) been available to those who continue to pay a monthly subscription to support the ""ongoing"" ~5 days of work they did that one time. EDIT: 0 updates in 2 YEARS."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use, coming from 3 years of premiere pro experience and 5 of editing in general."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's OK, but it doesn't seem very well designed and is very fiddly to use. It doesn't seem like they tested it with users before releasing it, which as a professional video editor and Adobe CC subscriber seems to be a consistent issue across all of their products."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"this thing is a life saver, been using for years and it has allowed me to make really high quality-edited videos, hoping for it to not change for it's really easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I have trouble editing text in effect layers. Could be my slow internet connection."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best mobile video editor that I have found. Not the best editor in general but good for Mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I personally use this for making YouTube videos and does the job perfectly could not do better and it is surprisingly free with is awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A very good experience with premere rushüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Would be better if audio had an easy way to fade out music. But It's pretty good editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent performance"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I got my video looking great but it keeps running into an error when exporting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't see the videos that I want to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wanted to see what this does, but not going to create an account just to do that. Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It says my email is already used my family doesn't know about this app and only I use my email and I just discovered this app I'm giving half and changing it later but can you help me?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ONE OF THE BEST MOBILE APPS FOR VIDEO EDITING, I JUST HOPE ADOBE HAS A DOWNLOADER FOR ALL SOCIAL MEDIAS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"so buggy and ruins audio while exporting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I should get account credit for being subjected to what is obviously a beta"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Sobrecarrega o celular"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice simple app but a fullscreen preview whilst editing would be nice. Also direct Google Photos integration when importing from cloud would be nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Guuuuu"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Super leaggy. Adds static in video that isn't actually part of the videos as soon as an audio file is added for music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love the app and I am now able to edit my own videos! Thank you Adobe Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use for thos on the go user"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app! Lots of free features. App seems to have a bug, though. After adjusting clips' speed, they wouldn't preview play anymore. Please fix that and I'll give 5 stars."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Always loved adobe products. This feels like a much better way to keep the feeling on a project going. If not create your final vision while right there, at least get a great first edit out while there."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very buggy app. Many many features lacking that any standard video editor like viva video provides"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very good app just hate it when it freezes I quit using it because of it hope they would fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Worst app for. Editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pratique et gratuit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gooood"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple yet powerful video editor. Some more audio controls would be nice, and setting up transitions can be tricky at first, but I learned most of what I need in around an hour, and it works extremely well. The only downside is that it is extremely demanding. I have a phone which is about as fast as the best phone of 2021, and the app can still crash sometimes, although auto backup made sure that none of my work was lost."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing app üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"it's good for quick video editing for stuff like transitions but it doesn't do anything with sounds other than pre selected sounds and voice over on the mobile device. I wanted to be able to add my own custom sound byte but it doesn't have this feature. really wish they would just add premiere pro on mobile with a price tag. it would be way more simple."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love Adobe Rush. I use it all the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Had to split audio from a clip and lay over on another clip, which made it super easy for the first time using"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Sometimes it's working Perfectly and hung all the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wery good for editing, easy to work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Goat üêê of video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App likes to run extremely slow at times. Such as deleting clips from the timeline or undoing anything. Also hangs up and asks to close the app, but even after it resumes continues to ask to close even with no problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seems to be a decent app so far. Need to use it a bit more to get a full impression, but so far it's easy to use and seems to work well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it, but if the white balance and advance color editing added will be amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App makes your voice sound like a chipmunk."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's convenience but not phenomenal. Adding audio is little bit annoying, I prefer explorer-like experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It does the job for editing videos but it's really unstable when exporting the footage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Op app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It won't sync my recorded audio in I did in the app to the cloud. Very frustrating!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Love it but it constantly crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Even on flagship phones this app does not run properly. Freezing when editing videos and adding clips. Can't even seek or zoom in without lag and ""not responding"" errors. Uninstalling, and considering cancelling subscription to other products"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Problems fixed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes all the time and projects have been lost/erased. I am currently using a Samsung note 10... This never happened on my Note 8. My phone even prompted me to put the app in deep sleep so it doesn't compromise the health of my phone. I don't know what happened but it needs to be fixed. At this point I will be better off trying a different app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Inconsistent flaky but easy to use. I use because it plays well with other very solid reliable Adobe apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Do not pay for this! The rending and final generated file on the highest possible quality setting looks like absolute trash. Almost a 10 year old phone camera. I'm using 4k 60fps footage from a DJI AVATA. Output using ""4k / match frame rate"" and the files are unusable. Regret paying for subscription. Going to cancel right now and never look back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe 2 factor authentication is ridiculous, time consuming and flawed! I hate it! I have to CONSTANTLY authenticate on my devices! Why?!?!?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"First project I tried to do in Rush couldn't happen because Rush crashing and deleting all my footage and work. I imported the same footage into Premiere Pro and it's been working fine. I also just edited a video from my Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and it worked fine. Is it possible that there are issues with Rush and GoPro cameras somehow? Please fix. Thank you!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I will start Using Rush More to complete video projects on the Go. Simple to use. Just open it and Start using it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb. Need more transition options though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best video editing app I've found by far but for some reason after about 10 edits, playback stops working. I have to fully close app, wait for 3 minutes, reopen, do 10 more edits and repeat."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's probably one of the worst editing apps out there, I have been trying to edit a 45-minute video and it keeps crashing and freezes on me makes me do it all over again and again. I almost lost 1 day and half on this video using this app I paid ¬£4.59p for it but it doesn't worth a penny. I been using this app on a Samsung A32 I don't know about other devices. Might work for others who knows. It's just so frustrating when you are almost done editing then it's crashing or stops working at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"CONSTANT CRASHING"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Usual Adobe mediocre app. Is a mystery how a billion dollar company keep produce software that is almost unusable. Without saying that the fact you have to login to use it is already a deal breaker. But you you have brave enough you will discover an app that crash regularly is slow even on recent device and as very bad ergonomic. üëèüëèüëèüëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app every day i need to reinstall the because it keep failing to export the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Is this no longer supported by Adobe? Why is it that it stopped being compatible on anything over PIxel 4?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It was nice while it lasted. Super hard to figure out initially. Made a few videos my first week having the app. Now a month and a half later I'm trying to made a video for someone and it doesn't work anymore. No updates available, so that's not the issue. I'll change my rating if someone gets back to me on how to fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Little slow sometimes, but that may be my slow phone to some degree. For a mobile editing app, this is pretty awesome. Does quite a bit, but obviously not as robust as premiere pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crashes every time I try to export the video, even reducing it to 10 seconds didn't do any good. It would take 5 minutes to process the first 10 seconds, then bomb out. Useless. No premium addins were used. There's no use paying for an app that won't work, so uninstalled. This has become an issue with every one of Adobe's apps, across three different phones. It's a petty basic app, too. I'm deeply unimpressed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't usually write review on apps, but this one has been so annoying I had to. I wanted so bad to like this app and make it useful bit it just didn't work for me. And by didn't work I mean, I couldn't work across other devices as advertised. My projects were synced and each device was signed in to my Adobe cloud account. I tried to just work from my PC. When it came time to share it, it wouldn't let me. Even though my account is paid for annually. I kept getting an upgrade notification."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nejmaismailstudio"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app üíñ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing can do anything"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Blank Screen Issue üò§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"There are some crashing issues during exporting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Im shocked at how horrible it is. I cant use photos exported from lightroom (which are in Jpg format) in my sequence for some reason. Only low quality content fits and works well while larger files kill the app. Extremely dissapointing app in comparison with everything else adobe has to offer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great asset to creating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like this app a lot. It gets the job done in a pinch"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's OK but moving different layers isn't easy and not being able to reverse speed is a huge pain"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good but not as easy as uploading directly into Tik-Tok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent as all adobe products just I would like to get more stickers, gifs and other resources for more fun..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent interface easy to use Has crashed on an export once. Other than that, great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Timeline loading times are slow,could be made a bit smoother.I don't think the app is taking the full power of the SoC ""effectively"" even though it slows down the device when importing and rendering."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Better audio options please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Used to work. Now Every time I try to edit something the playback pauses a few seconds in. Audio keeps playing. Then if I seek its all just black and audio stops. When I hit home its just spins the load circle and does nothing till I force close it. Tried updating and clearing cache as well as reinstalling."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Its easy to use but unfortunatley i cant save the rendered project on local mobile storage. When i click the share icon it only give option to share on social media only not to save on local mobile storge or any option to transfer this video feom mobile to laptop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When it works its great. Sadly most of the time it gets stuck on ""fetching your projects"" and won't let me start a new one. In fact it won't let me do anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"If Google had 100 stars I would give it to you its really an amazing experience that i am having with Rush it's only ease in editing ma videos‚úå‚úå‚úå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very gooooooood editor application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Add auto subtitle generator"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Editing was fine, bt export time is long... Pls fix it..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very Usefull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and won't render my video creations. So it doesn't download it, it crashes too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrific waste of time I want a refund d ASAP ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is not free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It works fine, when I need it. Rush is a good choice for a name."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Music tracks become glitchy and unusable when navigating the timeline. If you're looking for a mobile version of premiere pro for VERY light editing on the go, this will not do it for you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's so awesome to be able to do such detailed video editing and create films on my phone. It's perfect for those working in the entertainment industry like me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Panon doesn't work with panoramic shots.. Still UI could be better. Paid options and music are not worth the price"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I think it is worst because the app has only basic features you can't edit professionally Worst app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I subscribed in monthly offer and there were no additional graphics, advance editing audio etc.. why are you deceiving your customers?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never works just hang on the file"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've spent three hours making a video and I get export error. I've tried all formats and different options and it still won't export. I'm very disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"EXILLANT"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love that I can do everything I want right on my phone!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Voiceovers don't sync. Everything else does from videos to photos, but for some reason, voiceovers recorded on mobile do not sync to desktop which is what I predominantly use. This makes it a little bit difficult as I'm only able to use Mobile the majority of the time as 10% of the work is done on desktop due to my work schedule. This can make things rather difficult as my projects are quite large but I use rush due to portability. Using Galaxy s21 ultra. Fixing this would make it five stars."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Still needs more features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Had to Google a few things but this app is great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not even readers video , video stops midway"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APPLICATION !!!! Rendering problem and Cloud saving network error problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best editing app ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Perfect app with some flaws. Last minute I had to put together a slideshow for my daughter's quincea√±era it worked. My first time creating one but it worked out. User friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After editing almost 2 hours, there's a problem on rendering video which couldn't export and save. Apps crashing and showing some error notification. üëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app is very useful and easy to use, it just seems to export video that glitches on every other project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ridicola"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's saying there's a bug and I have to wait for the developer to release an update to fix it. I can't open my video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's my first time using it and it glitched so much and it is not showing the pictures I have selected please fix this as soon as possible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just awesome !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"okaay that's good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bir √ßok i√ßerik √ºcretli ama"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Video sound delay in export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The one stop solution for low-end content creators! I've been waiting long for something like this to revolutionise the video editing sector by integrating it on mobile devices. Thanks Adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I need help when I got to videos to edit one it says app isn't working and makes me exit help me and itl get a 5 star it keep saying rush keeps stopping"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's a paid apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I found amazing editing app on smartphone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"An ok mobile editing app. Inconsistent at times ..the audio lags with uploaded video. The added music doesn't stay with the project after use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive with decent variety of effects and features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quite an easy and simple software, definitely will use this whenever i'm away from my desktop!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Y ur ufone biling is unavailable infact I have 1000 rupees for adobe 4k"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly app!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely buggy and never works right."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great to edit with, but exporting causes ""artifacts"" on final video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast results, yet some bugs exist in mobile version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A very interactive user interface ensures a quick learning curve"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great and very easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This apps is very useful and easy to use but it has many bugs. I'm using a Google Pixel 7 Pro android phone, I often have weird bugs occur such as in the timeline when you play the footage the frame rate will seem accelerated, the sound will be high pitched also. Also often when I export there is some weird glitch that ruins my video... As well as occasionally the app just doesn't want to import my videos.. This is so disappointing.. I expected this to be able to run okay on Google's flagship..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This promised so much but it crashes constantly, and with greater and greater frequency as your project grows. I honestly can't see how I can salvage my project now, so I have wasted hours of work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Excellent features. Feel like a pro already."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Extremely handy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't export anything, exporting a 1080p video should not be this difficult"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't login"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Goooodddd"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Me encant√≥, primera vez que la uso y muy f√°cil la interfaz ü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps crashing when render. Had to render at least 3 times to complete it. Otherwise very useful when you're not on your machine render bigger projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to use the app. I have a Samsung S23 Ultra and even with a flagship device the app keeps crashing or pops up ""App isn't responding"" which was super annoying. I was really looking forward to using this product."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Flickers ridiculously during playback and I can't see the image at all. Only thing that works is the audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow, inefficient, the rendering of the video created graphical issues in the video. Clunky design"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Don't take subcribetion, very harassment video editing app. I am already get subcribetion. I am suffering video rendering. Very bad as like as foolish. Videos render take 1-2 hours, simple 1080 p videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app for instant video editing, but though not a great match with premiere pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't render video correctly after 15 minutes. Using on a Samsung S8 Ultra tablet. 4k source and default render/Export settings. Video gets jittery/jerky after 15 mins or so for longer videos. Tried exporting at lower res, results still the same. Full licensed 7 day trial Copy. Cancelling subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not free. Also super slow and buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Free. Works. No complaints."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ill update this later."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't let you do 1/1000th of the things you would want to do to edit video. Restricts you to its own audio library. Useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst video editing app ever. Bought premium subscription, it is showing error to save in disk."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Works for short.Short edits.. Not very dependable over all these years..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So far Program doesn't work ! Waste of money I paid the monthly. Now trying to reach someone to either fix it or refund me. Only been a member 12hrs and it's the worse experience. I still need to speak with someone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I want to like this app for its intended purpose: an easy to use video editing android app, but it's completely unusable. Audio stutters when adding music clips, there is no way to slip clips (that I can find) and basic clip manipulation is tedious at best/downright exhausting at worse. You never seem to be able to do what you intend to do with footage like their desktop app. If you manage to eek out an edit you like it will export with stuttering audio. Don't waste your time. Buggy AF"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"There's no way to use Google drive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Overatted app. Limited tools and editing options. Loses video quality."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Money hungry."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app NEVER runs smoothly, I have to restart it all the time and it just stops and starts audio... It's just a bit naff really... And with an S21 ULTRA, it should be able to run this smoothly, zero excuses"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good for my real estate business. Cons: I have Adobe Creative Cloud subscription for Pro which included Rush pro, yet my phone app wouldn't let me use the pro version of rush without paying another subscription separately for the mobile version. Not so good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Would be great but always issues with sync to creative cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't load videos, I can't see what I'm worling on. I've tried looking for a solution online and it's been hours now, still no fix found."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't succeed in rendering. What's the point?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be decent but the app crashes almost everytime now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"My All Time Favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use video editing tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"so far so good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app! I'm thrilled by Cinematic preset for color grading videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very handy video editing suite. But don't expect to be able to Render your video easily. I'm sitting on an average of about 1 working every 4 or so videos made. Makes the point of having the ap obsolete"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worked great initially but been crashing non stop the last several days."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's fine but could be better, right now when I export the video have a little freeze frame, that's awful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beats all the video editing software. Thank you Adobe Premier Rush!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Basic tools especially when you are used to Adobe Premiere, but when you are outside, just captured something interesting and wants to share it as soon as possible with a minimum of quality editing, this program does the job! :-)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ru stands for Russia"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing, simply that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very simple and easy to use and offers much, there's more potential to be found in the app, I plan to get Adobe Pro for pc too for more processing power and abilities. Ace! Thumb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bangladesh"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best mobile editor there is ! Does so much for all platforms"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very laggy. Need to be fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üî∞GOOD WORKING APPüî∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"GG, apps finally retired from working, glitching and crashing. I'm using it on Samsung S20+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very good and simple"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't export videos anymore and it keeps nagging me to rate this stupid app so here you go. Don't waste your time like me making a video only for it to not export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps constantly crashing while rendering, even lacks several important features for video editing like support for hdr content. Very disappointing for a giant like Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whenever i launch the application it just rotates from horizontal to vertical i cant even sign in happens on all my devices"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's too easy to use, and really user-friendly interface. It's such a nice app's. But one thing dev should consider about subtitle.. subtitle tools need to be more useful. Like you can go for adding a teleport style. Hope you understand.. all the very best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nag eerror pag esave mo na sya sa disk haysss ok na sana ang editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't download it, help!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering just doesn't work. Green artifacts every time. H265 clips with some color changes. Wish I could add a screenshot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super easy to use and easy to share videos using the creative cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Voice over and audio features to improved.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rendering and export times are a little slow but overall it's GREAT app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Easy edit options, wish it allowed to do changes to all photos at once and not have to individually change time or effect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good tools. Fast. Never crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love you very very very mind blowing apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Application for Mobile Editing ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Adding text cannot be done. Totally frustrating, time consuming and no success. No point to using it. Waste of money. Fix the features you advertise before adding new ones. The forum is full of people with similar comments. You offer no solutions and haven't fixed it. Still can't add text. Using paid version on state-of-art device, so no excuses."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"complicated"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great now it finally works with my S21 ultra after 18 months."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"NC app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A decent video editor, but it does not support some video and i don't know whether it doesn't support a particular frame-rate (23.98) or it has problem with a format (matroska). So, i have to convert the video first to 30fps MPEG-4 and then it is able to edit. After all these process it is good editor. Feature Request: keyframeing for effects, transform, colour, speed. And there should be marker available to mark on beats of songs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"AWESOME"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Still learning"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video editing size is not match the video + try to resize video but rotating instead lmao so bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's pretty terrible. I used it on a brand new Samsung Galaxy Tab, and it failed to work. you can scrub through, but the video won't play in the preview screen. some options work some don't. most options from the left-hand side are selectable, but once selected, nothing else happens. I don't know if it's the tab on the software, but this is very disappointing. I am not a stranger to this software because I have used it to edit videos in the past on PC, and it worked just fine."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very great work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Is good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good application very easy to work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It is so slow and glitchy. But is easy to use when it works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far I love it. Seems to have all I need for making the memory videos I want fo share. It was a great find and looks to work smoothly, though I've only done one video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great editing capabilities, but its not at 100%. Expect more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really smooth and easy experience for quick editing on the go!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great for a quick video although features are sometimes impossible to find."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have heard about it from Chatgpt."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps stopping in Every 20 sec, shows not responding"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't import 2hr movie to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a great App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works way better than my last editing program. It does lag a bit sometimes but it always saves my progress. One thing i dont like is adding a little text on the screen is anoying and limited even if you pay for the premium version. But other than that its amazing and i cant complain too much since its free. And made for a computer not nesisarily a phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple to use yet powerful for content creation, especially in the short form era."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy with full function"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loving it! It's a mini premier pro. Plenty of features for shorts and reels"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Better Nice Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Trying to figure it out. The program would not let me cut thing out and add a title. Not sure if I have to pay for it to get all the abilities the program had for tools."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Minimal features are paid but in others app it's free so not cost effective. Very worst experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app for New contant makers"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It does preliminary editing... minimizes file sizes needed to transfer to computer for editing effects and sound. But it's a very far cry from what I need to edit final videos to be posted to social media. Good for very small snippets, or else the sound and video gets choppy... but it's good for trimming sources taken via smartphone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Radi odlicno za neki pocetni nivo editovanja"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent üòäüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really impressed with this application. It's like premiere pro for mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"All good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Suprrb everything is excellent in this app and high class content is also easy to edit and very important app for beginners for learning. ü§üü§üü§òüëçüëçüëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, works really well for my social media covers but I wish I could edit the clips a bit more finely, like frame by frame. Right now or takes so long for me to line up everything in the timeline. Please help dev team!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use it every day. A huge piece of my content creation process. Over 3 million views on videos made with Adobe products and Rush is a go-to for my run and gun needs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's been a really good experience. I'm still learning, but I really like it! Will update my review in the near future, to provide more info about the application."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Poor frames, constant stutter. Running on an s22 ultra there is no reason for such poor optimisation"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crushes every time I want to save my videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Export crush problem ... Please fix it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"By far the worst and the best app around, I like it it's easy to use and resembles a PC program, I hate it because I can't use it twice, I always have to delete it and reinstall it to reuse it, so if that gets fixed it'll get more stars. This app is broken for real, why do I have to keep deleting it reinstalling it and creating a new account every damn time I wanna edit a clip?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far a really good experience, most settings and functions are very intuitive and provides everything you could need to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I thought I had finally found a simple solution to create the most basic video of panning across a still photo. It glitches at some random point in every export with any export settings. It's unusable for production. It's too bad nobody makes a simple android app that can create these simple videos without terrible overall quality or glitching image in the video. Hopes were high for a quick min, dashed now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is very good. But unfortunate, its little bit difficult for me to use it because it is my first time. But still, its a good app because it has more feature than other app (but of course some feature needs to using a premium membership(?) To use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app as i have used till now. But need more free effects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't load any videos super laggy and the app is kinda weird to use even though I use alight motion and node videoüòë"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic Editing App for Phones! Has a lot of editing features perfect for my TikTok account!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's great but could be better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"hello RUSH"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's an overall great experience! I use it to help finish edits on my content and get features I can't get in other standard apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent software. Occasionally I experience an issue when editing very long videos they sometimes get errors near the end but it's easy to work around. 5/5."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What is the use of the software if it won't let me export?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freeze in ""Preparing Media"""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add my own sound tracks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is too heavy, crash all the time. Adobe needs to look foward and let this more mobile friendly. Its annoying when you need to write somemething, the video tab is too small, also its takes so much time to cut and delete. We don't need a premiere pro we want a version better than capcut."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very great app but sometimes the sound gets off when editing and after exporting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"If this had a stabilization setting and a simple rotation setting, I would never have to use another app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Literally unusable. It crashes every time I open it and my phone has more than adequate specs to run it. Lightroom is rock solid. This is not. Edit: I've returned to see if this app has improved multiple times over the last couple years. Not one time has it ever been functional. I won't be trying again this time. Don't bother. I'm about to drop my Lightroom pro subscription and try Snapseed because what in god's name are you doing with the resources we're all spending on you?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Export stops at 1% , any solution ?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A few bugs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Needs more features on pre showing clips in full screen before downloading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good for a free app takes a little getting used too though"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Such a useful app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For as much as you get with the free version of this how could it be anything other than five stars. Still going! Still Amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing app to quickly edit videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Totally experience is best .but if some premium features are free it's perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Is good but, if lightroom can edit videos then what is the point of Adobe rush?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant install it in Samsung A7 tablet and dont work well with Samsung Galaxy FE 20 awful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app with simple function."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent app I hope the new update dealt with the glitches"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's a little difficult but to good application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Realy nice"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Im using this for the first time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glitchy exports, settings revert to default randomly, controls are basic. Needs a lot of improvement here. Sticking to desktop for now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The Very Rich App for Video Editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Less option.. Less workspace.. Less color grade option.. Everything is less.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"My needs are basic, just a trim and fade, but it did that and can do plenty more. learned the interface in minutes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Needs more export settings"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing software for people who just need the basics!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app become rendered video quality is best, please add curv feature in video speed and some modern video transition. üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"RUSH is just rush... When you need a quick video work just run to RUSH. I like this App."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great on my pixel 6"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's absolutely unusable, the audio cuts out ever 2 seconds, I exported a video just to have half of it frozen and the app would crash constantly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"100 % use students like pro. Thanks Adobe team"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It does not support in many mobiles. Video export stuck a lot. Very frustrated after taking monthly subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's so bad"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Hey it's pretty good"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Gabisa load data yg lumayan besar 70mb an"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable app. Bad videos apparantly because of video driver issues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thanks for a great app!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So like why can't I add my own audio into my own videos that I'm trying to edit? Is this not a video editing app?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Seriously? You can't add custom audio files? What's the point, then? Guys, do not waste your time, the app only allows you to choose pre selected random audio files..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"don't clickable Create button"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Had to uninstall due to errors. Very frustrating as I also lost all my work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is easy to use and you can work across devices but this is a very simple vdeo editing that there are many function missing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't even use Rush on a Samsung S22 Ultra. What a dumb joke."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very useful üëç"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Can we get an upgrade on being able to search my device for a filename. I have this app on my phone and I have to scroll endlessly through hundreds of audio files to find a song I want to add to video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not working. Way klaro nga app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"pitiful port"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent and I am so happy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Description says: cross-device video editor...work across devices...use it for free...unlimited exports. But I had to take out a subscription on Playstore and it still will not sync with Rush on my laptop despite media clearly on Creative Cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its okay for a mobile app. I feel there should be way more options that other video editing apps have. Would be nice to not have to jump from app to app when designing on the go,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy on phone!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The editing process is very easy and can be use after export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Best for colour garding"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Laggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"so good for norma uses"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Unable to import the pictures captured on DSLR. JPG format images."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App will not export videos. Fails during the rendering process every time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good when it works but usually crashes on export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best Video Editing App so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Es como premier pro muy facil de USAR"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty stupid and un intuitive, works well on ipad but here on phone just useless at best. Waste of time. Cant even change text of the graphics and overlays. Who created these apps and how they are tested? Didn't expect this from adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Kine master is best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not up to the mark."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuckk and slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Took me 3 hours on WiFi to realize it would never stop ""Fetching Projects"" (I don't have any projects saved on CC so you'd think it would only take a minute). Tried to save a video after a quick edit to see if it would work but got ""Error could not create project"". I'm using a Samsung S21 with plenty of memory and space. Disappointment besets me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"For PC could be way more user-friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast Quick and easy edits"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good tool to have in your belt if you're and amateur video editor- I edit for hobby purposes. I like putting a tune to gaming videos. So far the best option I've come across. Could do with more layers, effects, transitions and the ability to place markers. Also a big concern is the app slows down considerably with certain actions. Though I find clearing the cache before and in between sessions helps to a degree. Please consider improving this good editing tool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Updating review. Constantly crashing lately with GoPro video. No change to phone or GoPro. Can barely edit a video anymore. Just cancelled subscription. Great product but overpriced. Love the ability to work both home and mobile but not for $120/year."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and helpfully for simple mobile editing üëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good, not great. Considering to be an Adobe product, could be a lot better actually. Miss a lot of basic functionalities, export options very limited, very poor sound library, apps also stops often. I feel quite generous giving 3 stars honestly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Intuitive, easy to understand, a bit hard to move text cursor on mobile, no ending credits template."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sux"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not much features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Super application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App tends to freeze a bunch if you are trying to do much above a simple edit on a short clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Have S21+ and it struggles a lot. Will change rating on S23 Ultra is results are better. Lost of glitches, slowness, frustrating to use. Love Adobe, but something is wrong with Rush for Android."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Only a few days into the app, loving it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. Totally useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App worked great on my Pixel 3, but it isn't even available to download on my Pixel 6 Pro????"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy to use...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad experience and we cannot write or change text . Inly benefit is that it doent have watermark ,everything else is garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"App is really easy to use and has a lot of features for a free app i recommended"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a great tool for mobile and on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Odliƒçna aplikacija. Za brzu obradu videa."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Cannot render 8MP photo into 1080p/30FPS video with no effects whatsoever."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No text"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I had been successfully using this app for a while and loved it, but I have now wasted a excess of 10 hours on completely editing a project that it rendered horribly, content was missing the time stamp would say it was still a 22 minute video as it was supposed to be but it would get stuck on certainly frames and delayed my project substantially."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Seems Good and Effective for Simple Clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good fun and offers enough to work with to creat good edits on your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Templates are cumbersome to edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for video editing üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It costs money to unlock all features. Samsung needs to pay Adobe or perfect its gallery ap. This ap needs to be easier for dragging media lengths because it seems hard to access that feature."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and powerful little film editing tool for your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App has great potential but is crushing and not responding. Slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works a lot better than it used to. It is such an easy tool for quick video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not working properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Rush is a very good video editor software. I edit it on my tablet and it's really simple! The only con is that you cannot change the duration of multiple images, you have to do it one by one."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For on the go editing, this app is very good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic app to make awesome photography and videographey i highly recommend it üíØ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worse app ever i see at the time of rendering always crash and close"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Straightforward and very nice to work with."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Simple enough, but won't export at 24fps. Disappointing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mean application ü©µ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashed and closed me out of my very 1st project about 10x. Eventually got it to do what I needed but needs a lot of improvement!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Just getting re farmiliar with the app. I love the editing features and controlability of temperature, exposure, and saturation for each clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I just loving it , better than any other video editing app present in here"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is simply incredible. Full HD for 23mb? I'm impressed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice App for editing but there isn't nice options of colour grading the video and options of fading in and out of the audio. Please work on them"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Error saving file to disk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice and best apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wow, I've been an Adobe user for over many years and their buggy apps continue to amaze me. How does a video app with such limited capabilities fail to render a simple project without visual artifacts and glitching? Why do I continue to pay to be in this abusive relationship? Does anyone use Adobe products by choice? Save yourself from installing this hellscape of corporate decisions that mascarades as a creative app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing app on your phone, whoop! üòé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfict"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Distorts audio recorded with phone, (super deep) ain't that dumb... it's a mobile app. Is there an obvious fix or setting that I'm missing?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"üí©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow and buggy on a Pixel 7 Pro. Feels very familiar to this premiere refugee. Adobe needs a complete redo of all video software. They just don't get it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very basic video editing app.. I watch video on youtube saying it is best app on android No way... It is even bit frustrating to use basic things like transform, adding texts. It is very basic editing app... It is my first impression on this app..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelente üëå app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best mobile editing app üëçüëç pure Quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is rubbish it doesn't work at all You guys should look for something better to do and not this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It sucked"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So Glichy!!! This app has more problems than usefulness. It has problems syncing it's own text, problems, problems syncing and won't upload to YouTube because it keeps losing signal. Beyond useless!!!!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"easy but very simple. Casual Editing is fine, it is missing some basic functions, but hey - who is editing on a phone anyways! :D"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashing, can't even manage a 5 minute video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Editing is smooth But having difficulty in exporting video Export stops after 3-4%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Original: This is a great app on my Pixel 6 (5 stars). So good, I subscribed to Premiere Rush Mobile. However, on my ASUS Chromebook with an Intel CORE i5, it will not render (1 star). UPDATE: Now (1/12/23) this app is no longer available for my Chromebook. I should never have paid for a year of subscription. Lumafusion, on the other hand, is well supported and works very well on my Chromebook and Pixel phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use, it's nice video. No ads"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It is good for basics, but I feel like it could do with more features. I wanted to remove the shake from my video, but couldn't see that option"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its a neat app that is so easy to use and has high quality features. Everything is very organized and quick to learn if you haven't edited before. For a mobile app this is definitely the best one for editing. Highly recommend! üì∏üé¨üòÅ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"As of January 2023 this app is finally usable on Android, using a galaxy s21 ultra, was able to create a minute video with multiple clips."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Artifacts and glitches in 90% of exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rubbish app, spent quite some time making a video, adding audio, transitions, making some colour adjustments, adding a title, only to find there isn't a way to save my newly created video to my phone, or at least no way I could find, and this isn't my first try at video editing, far from it, I actually have my own YouTube channel. Seems to have enough features to be useful, bar the actual critical features of being able to save your videos, which makes the whole thing a complete waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app for on the go editing. If you have something which small and quick like a reel which you have to edit, this is the best app you can get to do it on your phone. Love this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Constantly getting Error saving video to disk, only way to fix it is to uninstall and reinstall"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Less amount of features, more of a brand. No watermark. Slow and clumsy to use. Was Expecting more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I can't believe such a great video editing tool is available at no upfront cost!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't load. What's the point of offerring an app that COS can't run? Is anyone at Adobe fixing this?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported video had horrible quality. Wth did adobe do to my video! Outrageous!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's more stable than what's built-in to three various platforms..... That's about it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's fine buts lacks feature that other editing apps offer. I know its to do otg edits but still."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Seems to have everything I'm looking for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So much problems on this app now. Videos are getting scratch. And cant export easily edited Videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing.. no ads.. and.. stabil working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just Started The Journey. I love Adobe, Till now supported me for learning. Wanna buy more memberships."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Promising, but *suprisingly* weak in the basics. Can't fullscreen preview; limited source input options (i.e. no OneDrive); need to RESTART TABLET to force Premiere Rush to re-scan device footage and make it available for use. Hopefully Adobe will develop this further, as it has a lot of potential. Maybe iOS version is better...???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing Amazing Amazing üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app. User friendly and intuitive. Bit glitchy when replaying videos as any audio stops and starts butnthe video continues to play."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's simple and powerful!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Love it!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable, constant freezing, if I am able to get to the point of exporting a video, freezes while rendering. Junk."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick n handy keep.up.the good work, the renders have been weird lately with audio skipping or playing weird. Please fix thisss!! And give 2k render pleasee"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for color grading in few minutes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Worked first time from a set of go pro videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes. Text interface is ridiculous."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Half hours of crushes at export, on Samsung Galaxy S20FE, up to date phone and app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Aside from not being able to insert your own audio file, everything works great and easy to use, most features are available without the subscription cost"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The preview is just blank. There is audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst ever i had seen... Large size but less function. And also lagging..... Much..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Does everything i need. How is this free?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very useful compere to others"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I originally had issues rendering to my phone, so I started using Rush on my desktop to render a project. It worked only once. Now I can't get desktop rush to show any of my projects except 1 and they all showed up a couple days ago. I've tried logging in and out of all devices multiple time. Uninstalled and reinstalled. It's so buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Some mobile features could be improved, like allowing users to type font sizes, scaling an image to size, etc., instead of using a slider that gets away from the finger on the slider. Overall works well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible, just terrible. Extremely counterintuitive. Everytime I try a video editing app other than desktop Adobe premiere pro, I get frustrated."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Always freezing on my Samsung Fold 3, the add text feature doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app for video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not working at all!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why can we use it without logging in? Or you fix the infinite popping-up of ERROR when logging in!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"PRETTY MID"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Needs improvements"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Project doesn't even show up in creative cloud or Dropbox"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Hevey ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üí´üí´"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very usefull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"its a üëçüëçüëçüëç nice app but it needs a update to fix/ remove the blinkings in the video after saving it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The fact that the free portion of this application is so good makes it worth giving 5 stars. After you learn the free portion at your own pace you can upgrade without any pressure to do so. If you are a content creator without a laptop I strongly recommend Adobe rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes. Can't even use it. Samsung Galaxy S22"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Nice video editor app for free access apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Will not work on S22 Ultra?! Shane on you Adobe, just shameful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Impressive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"A very frustrating app to use. The preview of the video is tiny, editing text is a nightmare and the keyboard doesn't show up the most of the time, when you need to write something."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"We need an opinion to write in Arabic language ŸÜÿ≠ŸÜ ŸÅŸâ ÿ≠ÿßÿ¨Ÿá ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ•ŸÖŸÉÿßŸÜŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®Ÿá ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Feel like pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best for mobile video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good for basic editing. I really wish it had color grading beyond adjusting vibrance, saturation, etc. Especially considering it is a paid app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you for watching"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to edit text in subtitles."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless. Constantly crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very exilent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful as android app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's cool and easy to use, thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fairly intuitive. Made my first video :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is great on my Samsung S8 Ultra, using Android, but the same (GoPro) files will cause the desktop (Windows 10) version to do a blue screen faint and reboot; it's an issue for lots of Adobe account holders but, nevertheless, it's still good for what is, ostensibly, a free app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use Adobe premiere, so it was kind of easy to figure out. I would put in some sort of trimming for any unwanted sounds or segments in audio or video. But good app for quick edits."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is really amazing application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not providing even basic tool for free, so you cannot attract new user, not at all a beginner friendly, except installation everything is chargeable meanwhile Inshot providing basic tools for free and charging for advance version when a beginner turns into pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rush is my absolute favorite app for video editing on my phone. I've tried my fair share of video editing apps with most of them I became frustrated. Clips were moving where I didn't want them. I had to click 3 times to shorten a clip or extend a clip. There were too many buttons. Seriously, I edit ALL my reels in Rush. Upload to IG and add music and a voice over. It takes me no time at all! The past week and a half I've edited 7 reels on Rush and will continue to edit my reels on Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The most stupid things you guys are doing is inability to edith "".MOV"" files shoot with my DSLR camera. Other software can work with mov on phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Like layers; auto zoom on photos. However, app struggles to work with sound and not a lot of transitions available yet. Also, would be nice if you can add a marker for the timeline - to allow snapping of photos and sound to it. Drawback: not stable at all. Noticed that crashes almost certainly if edit 4k more than 10 min of footage. Even on Galaxy Note 9"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not intuitive. screen fu cations difficult to make accurately."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's good so far. I just couldn't blend videos. It's great for a basic edit. Rendition is fast too. It's good but can be better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is not made well. No where does it say you can export a video. It seems the app is made just so it can be hard to use, trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editorü§©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Go√≤"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Error saving video files in my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Made a great video and picture collage for Christmas!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Coming from Adobe premiere pro, this app gives a similar, easy to understand interface on mobile. It really helps me to do those last minute edits on my phone without any hassles. Would love the edition of essential graphics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best video editor. I repeat, the best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Piece of junk. You can't even cut pieces of video/audio on the phone. If you CAN, they made it actually impossible to find. This is a glorified slideshow maker. You're better off using Windows Movie Maker than using this on your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If we export video in high quality the video is crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best you can ever get! Video editing and everything nice!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really enjoyed the automatic reframing. Saved a lot of time. There are some crashes and I really wish I could zoom and pan manually as well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Honestly, for using it on mobile I'm pretty impressed. The app struggled a bit once I started mashing videos together with graphics, but that could also be my phone. Loved the app and I'll be using it again for any and all of my editing needs <3"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works like Vegas Pro 4 Sparta Remixing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm very disappointed, a company like Adobe can make a much better app than whatever Rush is for Android, I'm using S8 Ulta and this thing is a beast and can run anything, but for some reason it struggles with Rush, this app is nowhere near being optimized for Android, Adobe makes tons of money and I can guarantee you that they can improve this app, it is very limited with options or features, this is the reason I switched to other editing apps, ADOBE WORK ON YOUR APPS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I edit my videos with Adobe Rush on my computer yet I cannot access them on my mobile devices. I thought that was the purpose of this subscription cloud service. Adobe has let me down again, I should not be surprised."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disgusting app. Rendered a full HD video to see glitches throughout the video in the end"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Disappointing. Since the last update I can't import simple photographs to edit. IT'S RIDICULOUS. They changed the photo format to heic and sure try...installing a codec or one could convert photos...but WHATEVER. So much for the RUSH. REALLY??!! I hate throwing money at apps that don't work after being advertised as accessible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My tablet switched to Portrait to landscape ober an over. cant use my tablet :/. if this problem was fixed, i will give it a 5 star"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"As a pro multimedia specialist, there are some quirks because I'm more used to Premiere Pro on desktop, user bias will tell me to look for things that aren't in this mobile app. But so far so good, this app is way better than the competitors I've used. At least no attempt to put watermarks on my rendered videos. I wish though that it was available on tablet."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice app really helful, editing and sound track adjustment can be better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good work üòÄ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wonderful but there was missing in or out selection tool from pr"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rubbish app. Incredibly bloated, unintuitive... Adobe at it again... terrible and crashes even on latest phones!! You have been warned!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great on the fly video production. I use for social pots, ads and general promotions. Love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is the best way to edit videos on your mobile device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The ux is incomplete, and lacks things like the easy ability to loop an audio track which seems like a fundamental Gap. It's useful for the most absolutely rudimentary of video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I can't add photos taken with my phone's front camera to the timeline. Error message: could not import media(s). My Phone model: xiaomi 12 lite"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Naci"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Gud"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and sensational results"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cannot install the app on Samsung Z4. Installation stop abruptly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Decent as expected from Adone, seems solid. Still learning way around but fairly intuitive so far. If you already have a desktop subscription, why not. Saves a lot of potential nonsense with crummy ad supported alternatives."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"everytime I edit, the audio slows down so much to the point of it becoming unrecognizable, and for some reason it's just the audio, the video is just fine, but if only the audio becomes unrecognizable, the whole project is ruined"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Login problem occurred continuously. Waste app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use it all the time, it's amazing for basic to mid level editing in my opinion."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm trying hard to install it but just after downloading the package, the installation fails. I have more than a GB of free space on my system and got full battery but still I'm not able to use this product. I can download other apps from playstore and install it. I have tried restarting my phone but still the problem persists. Also I have all the latest system updates on my device."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't sign in it says ssl certificate authority not trusted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just downloaded it ,checked it and it has everything that i want ,effects check,speed control check, video cut pan zoom and everything check no watermark check ,free check thanks to adobe for this .they are making best application for Android users ,i am requesting a animation app that can make basic animation"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This this operates about as well as scarlet and violet on the first day of release just like those games Adobe you could do better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good! A bit hard to use some editing functions on a smartphone tho"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"no reverse option :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ocm edit videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disappointed Missing the fewture of adding srt files Adding a text is not easily done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Almost totally useless, but it allows users to clip the view to a different aspect ratio. Wow. The inept, script kiddie work continues. It's been so long that I'm certain Adobe no longer grok the existence of a quality product. Are they giving the Rush basic freebie to subscribers of the photography package in hope of finding traction because they can't sell it anywhere else? Even free is too expensive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun.... on point, love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Today I purchased it but experience is very bad, I have 8gb ram 128gb storage OnePlus Nord but it's not working, every time it's crashed..i will not suggest this app. Please return my money ASAP. I am totally frustrated."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really fast useful edits made easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Please add the feature to export only audio..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works üëèüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best software \ app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Best best best‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is amazing app ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Spend so much time on a project and then time came to export it. Well, it never went past 11% even after leaving it overnight multiple times. Get any other editing app. This app may be good in PC not on a smart phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app to work across via media. It's been great for my business."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great control, works great on phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it, would recommend to everyone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At first this was best ap for video but theen it was not accepting import of videos and now its not rendering Fix this issue This type of issue are not expected from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It is a good app but i tried the trial then premium but the trial doesn't let me export. It lost even it says its done. It disappear. So i have to edit again but same thing happen. A waste of time editing 3x for nothing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Absolutely EXCELLENT app. Just brilliant! Really surprisingly powerful editor in a really simple toolkit. Just beautiful for what it is. The only reason why I've subtracted a star is because it's too difficult to rotate/crop a video. Especially with the current endless debate we all seem to have with portrait and landscape video editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It has a lot of glitches"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update: footage wont load anymore. Usable, and well laid out once you're used to it. Drag handles and grab and place is a little finicky. Cutting and deleting clips immediately fills the void with the next clip, but is not obvious, should have a sliding animation that shows the clip filling the space. Still missing pretty basic functionality such as audio level adjustment (can't fade out music) Excited to see how good it gets!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing every 5 mins"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent video editing tool!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe is Great üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fulfills requirement for editing on mobile. Layers, effects, transition, graphics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ur customer service is horrible they don't respond to chat, it's another issue now i need some to contact .. this is Adobe or a fraud? The app is useless no much fu ctions, i tried the trial and it has proven it's not worth it.. nowI need a refund your app is really doesn't have anything special we can get much feature from free apps.. how I apply for a refund after ur 3 days trial. Many bugs and not working as expected"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cutting made convinient"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Simple, straightforward UI."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This may be a cut down Premiere Pro but it has all the functions I need. It does however crash more than it should so 4 instead of 5 stars."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Preview of video is fine but when I export video it's all glitchy. Using pixel 7 pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't live up to the Adobe legacy. Can hardly handle 4k video and freezes often on a brand new ZFold4. Many other options out there that actually do work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Manukumar"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"So Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Output video quality is pixelated and can't upconvert resolution."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I keep coming back to Rush beacuse while I try other apps and get inspired by the settings and so forth, I just really need to edit length swiftly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good. A little difficult with the phone gui- or interface, but it's really nice and great to make video with the great Adobe quality, at any time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not able to export video after editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Super buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Editing is ok, but I the video I rendered was all glitchy. It's ok in the preview but the final result is not"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for making videos and easy to get kids learning too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No support basics features such cut and crop..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everything I try to export my videos, there is always error occuring and stops the export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good for editing short videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable. Firstly, the video playback freezes to the point of no return. The app crashes time and time again. The audio gets pitched down during playback. It's frustratingly slow. Lastly, once you finally get past all that and continue to the render and export part, it never completes. It either never gets past zero, or it gets stuck at a random percent and never goes past it. Don't even bother with this app. Save your time and effort and place it elsewhere.üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wow ... can't even split a video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app everü•±. You can't even add music from your phone. Harder to use and understand."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It keeps crashing whenever I want to adjust the color"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I payed $35 for this app and now it doesn't work anymore. It says that it cannot fetch my projects and if I try to open a new project it gives an error. Tried resetting but nothing works. $35 is a lotttt for something not working. I have a Samsung S21 so not an old phone either."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Text editor not working... get phone hanged"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love this app! Can you please improve the ""add footage"" dialogue? It doesn't show me all available videos. I would like to be able to select various sources in a gallery app and open them in Rush via the Share function. Also, please add to option to reverse footage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I really like that the app has all the functionality without being overly complicated. Some glitches, including not always exporting when set on auto quality and files not syncing between mobile and desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not bad.. Simple yet usefull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I currently have a subscription but when I try to export a video the subscription page pops up saying I have to subscribe, our curiosity I tried to subscribe again but it says I am already subscribed, I can't export any videos because I'm stuck on the subscription page, fix this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great and easy to use unless you want graphics. That can be more tricky and choices are limited."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty werid app if u go to edit a clips you can't see the clip it's just black"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"How the hell do you people expect me to edit my font? The area for the video is so small i can't even see what I'm doing. What's the point of paying for it if you guys can't allow for THAT simple function"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the one I actually needed. At first it's little bit confusing but as you go on and explore, things get easy. Much better than other editing apps. No advertisements, no subscription popups, easy to use. Such a good experience on phone, no need to have an expensive PC and costly software. This one does the work. 5 stars :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It just works. Easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Superb mobile editing app which also links to other platforms as well as into the Adobe Creative Suite"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"non comptaible with chromebook acer spin 714 !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It does exactly what I would expect it to do. Very quick and easy to use üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quiet interesting depends on your device It creates amazing video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I DO love that you can edit quickly on your phone, but the sheer hassle of not being able to quickly splice your files (you have to re-upload the original file every time you want to use a new clip), and the impossibility of using the simple title function... Leaves me using my PC.. My 2009 version of Adobe Elements is my go-to over this. Adobe is incredible in general. This app though..it's not great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I made a video for yt and it froze up and broke the entire video, turning it into a one frame screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crashes all the time. Impossible to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"File browser really sucks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive and a really easy way to edit coming from a premiere pro background."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to make content and post quality videos quickly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I m not unable to edit any video its stop working please fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great But to EXPENSIVE per month"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It does great although sometimes it takes a while for footage to be put in when it finally does make it it does great some days are better than others"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"after editing while downloading always rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"No sound on videos after exporting. I googled looking for answers but I see fixes for sound not syncing up. Some videos showed thr desktop version, Adobe premier, but i don't have that. I can't afford the extra subscription. I hope someone can help me before I give up on this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is the best editor evrything is Fantastic perfect to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Please add more transitions, like for example Power director has. When I am editing on the go this would save me a tun of time from switching to Premiere Pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. There's one missing. Text on screen doesn't exist. so I rush into different editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great video editor. It can be tricky to navigate the interface."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is suuuuper slow. Just to cut and delete clips it takes like 20 seconds to do one process. And the sound randomly cuts out sometimes. Really not time efficient!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love the easy interface and the help option when there is a function you're unfamiliar with. I also love the cloud storage that can be access accross all my devices."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome for making vids on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Did I waste my money? Why is the app keeps crashing whenever I tried to change the clip speed?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The most comprehensive video editor software that I have experienced. Easy to learn and multiple tools to use and improve your presentation."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Money control aap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for editing videos loved it. Adobe rush is the best choice for video editors as it's easy to use, has great interface and option for direct adding to youtube and social handles."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The experience was good. I have already unsubscribed my payment plan of adobe rush. Still money is being taken. Please help to unsubscribe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keep crashing while editing video. Very inconvenient to use, but this is a powerful vidoe editinf tool I can find for mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to edit on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Is a basic video editing app, maybe useful for some simple videos for social media but rendering the videos many times comes up with errors and also reduces image quality."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's alright, but it lacks a lot of stuff that content creators use. E.g green screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works so well! Very intuitive. High quality."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good so far If anything goes bad I will update But 4 stars for now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Overall good. New few additional features and couple of workflow modifications."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for editing videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No 4k in export. Very less options while editing graphic like titles and intro. Because the whole purpose of having a video editor in phone is shoot edit and upload."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes more than half the time when you export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"3.5 really. Great potential, hugely neglected. This could easily be the best video editing app for mobile but adobe doesn't give this app the love it really deserves. If only they'd optimize it, bring some critical features like playback resolution degration and listned to the community more and updating this damn thing, it would have been the ultimate social media quick editor i wanted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"always crush and error"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good for nothing Last night I downloaded this application and made a video edit. I kept it for rendering at 2.51am. At 3 it is still 0%. Thought, it will be done by the time I wake up in the morning and wonderfully the rendering is still 0%. I wasted 4 hours entirely editing the video to get no output. Such a shame on Adobe. Did not expect this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very simple and smooth"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, intuitive. Pretty good for free!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, lots of color grading options. My only beef is it sometimes freezes when you're importing large amounts of videos but hey its on mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for intent and professional work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use, and superb quality. Absolutely recommend!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I quick professional video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëåüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Makes YouTube Shorts a breeze to make!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wastage of internet and mobile storage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Recently, this app keeps crashing. Despite having more than enough space to render files it continuously runs into the above said problem. If this issue could be fixed, it would get a higher rating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"New update is good still need a few things like adding lyrics etc overall it's been a very nice improvement"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"TOP APP!! üî•üî•üî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Highly reccomend! Great features, very easy to use. 10/10!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love how I can sync projects across all my devices that have Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like both cp & android app, nice clear videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it. Makes editing short vids for IG and TT quick and easy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"the video that i want to edit is jusk a black screen you can only hear the sound but you can't see the video and it's buggy the tool and hdu icon just flicker"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported videos have bad quality. There's no good way to add transitions, effects & masking."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not right at all. Paid for a year's subscription then while doing audio editing it tells me I need to pay the same amount again for premium. Total rip off."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use it every day and I definitely recommend it for creating reels for social media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Love all the features, but it always screws up the audio.... Glitches music and misaligns voice. If not for those I'd have really zero complaints but I can't finish edits due to these problems."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video unable to render past 1% Even though i am running this app on a powerful device, it stops rendering my edit after it crosses 1%. Just compiled few clips (about 5) and changed duration. Very dissapointing when you get this response from a trusted developer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Just started. Good enough üëçüèæ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is my first project, but I can see the difference in my video clips. They seem to be far better than what was shown in some other app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best software for phone high level editing in mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app when it works is good, but there are many times when it really lags especially when opening projects, other than that and some bugs, it gets a simple job done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome but sometimes it won't sync correctly. Though it's now often."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so gud"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's colors are dope"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So buggy, sequence screen appears black all through... A fix is needed urgently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Great on my older phone. Does not work on s22"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Have some bugs. You can make it much better, please add new features. You are Adobe company. Your name has value, make it better please üôè Adobe you are a very powerful company! How can you have a app that it's not excellent?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"essential for mobile video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow niceee premier in hand"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not as quick and easy as another paid app I use. Can't preview my pm4 files. And export is limited to 720dpi.. Music file could be categories better.. for Adobe this is not impressive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its borderline unusable, crashed so many times, and some very basic editing tools are missing, like splitting a clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuck at fetching projects... why..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes often, especially when importing videos. Luckily my progress is saved. But very frustrating when trying to make videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lags over lags, the app crashes everytime I change speed or adjust sound, editing a video takes hours because the app is extremely slow. I have to download the videos as soon as I finish editing them or I lose my videos. My experience with this app is absolutely terrible, I'm considering trying other apps because this one is the worst I've tried."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"No other mobile video editing app comes close. It's almost perfect, although the addition of some simple features would be very welcome. The gating off of some key features behind a pay-wall is understandable but unfortunate. Love this app, but it's hard to give it a great rating when I can't get past a ""Fetching Projects"" screen. Please fix the bugs. This could be an amazing app but it's being held back by bugs at the moment."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When I Export It, I check on the vid and it freezes at a point and stays like that for the entire video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use it daily. Works for the minor fixes not found elsewhere in camera apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for composting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why can't fetching project? Not working error..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just installed, can't get it to work at all. Tried creating a project with two <8 second clips and it just keeps crashing. Tried a few different things, nothing is working."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"use this to make YouTube shorts, does a great job and is easy to use! My channel is my name on here too (shameless plug haha)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This app is pretty basic, but well built and useful for editing simple clips on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Such a great app. Would give it five stars if it had the ability to adjust keyframes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless application is better than this vn capcut kinemaster prequel."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So smooth to use ,it's amazing for vedio editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It worked fine at first but the last few months it lags so bad its impossible to edit a video. I just end up transfering everything to my iPad and edit with Lumafusion instead. I won't be renewing this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is broken..! Crashed several times while editing. Very slow response time on some actions, like deleting the clip from timeline, adjusting speed and other settings - you have to wait like 3sec or more after doing this action to get the response. And most importantly it freezes on video export!! Tried to find the solution how to fix it but it looks impossible. This app has great potential to be the best video editing app for mobile, but development team has to work harder on that. :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good first experience without a tutorial or reading instructions... adding media, cutting clips straightforward, audio can be muted easily but not added from additional track without more investigation. Exporting seems rather straightforward... Using basic version - Pro may have more options- not ready to purchase just yet, more trials to do...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Basically this app contains all features i needed to edit vids for tiktok and daily usage. I love it so far. I will recommend for everyone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool, very good for beginners."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app is perfect thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rush is hot sheeyot!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I didnt get to try it, becuase there is no reason someone needs to sign in to just use an app. Make that optional, Ill check it out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It used to be a bad app. Now, it is super user friendly!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Giveing it 3 star bcz it have very less and limited features when compared to primer pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Jozzz"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just like adobe premiere pro on Android. Quite an awesome experience üôÉ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Interface is easy to use. Videos are also produced with original clarity. But comparing to the app size, features are very less, even compared to its PC version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"3yr old issues. App crashes everytime on export. 5 clips under 20 seconds each 1080p, black transitions and one audio clip.. will not export. Issue dates back to 2020 with no resolve. NO SUPPORT FOR THIS APP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Way to much helpfull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is super annoying that this is not working with Samsung Galaxy 22ultra. And more annoying: Adobe is not giving any answers to all their costumers, when and if it will be fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The output is very disappointing.... the video stops and dont play the full video.. it is corrupted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very fun so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app it's ok but far from excellent. Works badly on S21 phone. It crashes often, and is not user unfriendly. A small app as PicsArt does so much better. There are no options of some music either."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I would've thought that this would have the same quality as Premiere Pro, but instead it's just as difficult and awkwardly ridiculous to navigate as every typical mobile app interface. Give me a proper effects menu, editing tools and don't bloat it with presets. Let me freely move tracks on the timeline, give me shortcut buttons! What would take me five minutes in PP could easily take an hour in this. Either it's for editors or tech simpletons, you can't have it both ways."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Takes forever to open when you just want to do a quick edit or video stitch. 'Rush' is definitely not the word for it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This has all the basic editing tools in the free edition and the main advantage is that it will render the video with no watermark. I loved it..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not as easy as i thought. But it does more than other apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic especially now that I'm only using my Samsung A23 smartphone to shoot and edit my videos. This is a very good app no doubt 100%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This application is very cute and video editing is very fast and the application best for Android devices I am impress its features so you can use this application and enjoy more pictures thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Am enjoying this app and can't wait to do magic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I sell cars and I make videos for everyone of my customers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why is it that I can use pan and Zoom feature on still images but not on video, please do that asap. It gets really frustrating. I expect a lot more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Randing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app to make videos of ur own"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this one is not working properly in Tecno pova neo can you please fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is really smooth compared to others. Worth a shot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good dis app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For a free video editing app, it's pretty much the best you can get."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far, Unlike it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Most annoying thing within the app is the never ending suggestion pop-ups that you have no way of getting rid of and they are constantly in the way. Can't wait for Lumafusion.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Many clips that I import play back with slow audio, even though the original file and exported video play back in a video player correctly. It makes it impossible to sync various clips to each other or music. The support responses in Adobe's forums don't work. Several other users have reported this issue for a long time and it doesn't sound like Adobe is interested in supporting this software with bugfixes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It creates 10 minutes videos fantastic but after 11th minute it stucks on one frame and not playes only voice could be hear . Plz sort it out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't sync wireless creative cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After add a video it just blank."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"crashes while exporting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"For an Adobe product, this needs a lot more object animation and transition capabilities. It's limited in the same ways as its app competitors -- basic, basic animation and transition capabilites. I need a serious editing app for social media posts I can whip up on the go on my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Coming from iOS to Android, I expected as great an experience from the exact same app. This one is pretty buggy sometimes with multiple reboots necessary to make things pop up in the timelines or to work..even in short edits. However it is still an extremely powerful video editor and could EASILY be my favorite mobile video editor if they simply squash the bugs.If it was as stable as the iOS version, it would be 5/5 (even though I would like to see some more features added). But as it is: 3/5"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿßÿ≤"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Kuch future nhi hai Bhadda app hai"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"My favourite app best other then apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Using this app makes me want to pull my hair out and toss my phone aside! It's constantly glitching, the app keeps closing, and the editing process sucks where you can't even get real-time play through going with your edits. Horrible experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It often crashes and i lose projects. When its working it is great, but very disappointing to lose a lot of hard work multiple times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible and extremely basic. The video edit which is on the phone is more advanced than Adobe's Rush! Very disappointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Im liking it so far, i just created my first video. I think in order to use this app the way you want to you should ask yourself what you want the end result to be and then research how other people have done it before in a similar way."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It edits video just doesn't have many options."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üíñüíñü§†ü§†"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I could could create an ad or music video. My back ground is in graphic design. So whatever features I haven't figured out I'm sure I could if I messed with it a bit more. Maybe watch a tutorial. So far it's pretty great. Biggest complaint! I wish it had the simple feature to export single frames. I'd love to grab some still shots."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Needs an account to simply function üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to Work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's quick but is limited a lot. Basic tools required is not findable like blurring a face only etc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Practical for social media use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfecto para los trabajos express"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app is fine but sometimes it lags! If you could possibly add some new effects for transitions and playing the video in reverse! and to be able to add as much graphics on one video( currently only 3 graphics can be added in the same frame) thank you so muchüôå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Installed the application several times but doesn't sign in on any time. Ridiculous."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Paying over $70 for this BS to not work when on the spot at work ?? NOT WORTH IT. Stick to DaVinci n don't waste your time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Seem to have to pay for mobile and desktop service even if it's just rush. Rip off."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"At first editing is a bit complex, but it gets easier as you practice. I love this app cause I can use it to edit clips when I don't have my laptop"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Always fun and easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app didn't even open! Useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and easy to use. Maybe if you can add a few transitions, we'd appreciate it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive, easy to use and surprisingly advanced editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its so frustrating how I can't render a video I have spent a lot of time to edit on my Samsung S9"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super simple to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like the PC app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"has 4k in discription like it's a free feature, it's behind a pay wall as usual from Adobe, getting unlocked apk now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Was good for clips of about 30 seconds with no extra sounds/music/effects. But crashes when trying to render a two minute video with music and titles."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Requires account sign in, basic function to reverse a video clip is unavailable, cannot use music from device - classic Adobe mediocrity gone mobile.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"God it is absolutely a nightmare to try and edit with this. Simple tasks like moving video and audio clips in the timeline is a cumbersome and clumsy process. Stick to basic video editing with this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Smoooth Operator"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"add chroma key please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really cool..really useful..need more tools for audio editing feature.thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Please add ability reverse speed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's the best app I've ever used. So nice all features available. Only that it didn't allow me get the aspect ratio 18:9 I'd love it to be present. In all you did a great job. Blessings."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You made my youtube video into a powerpoint slide show, this frequently freezes when editing, the audio cuts out when trying to edit, and is overall some of the worst editing software I have ever used."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very useful editing software. I used on my samsung mobile A73. Has lot of options from speed ramp, color filters, graphics and more. But it failed to export the project at 4K 30fps. Recommend for beginner level editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great software for video editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great app but Do not try to make presets in this app it so frustrating! I've just wasted half a hour trying to make a preset and I pressed off the photo for 1 second thinking the adjustments had been added to my photo and saved however they hadn't I find this so time consuming and frustrating if I want to undo my adjustments I would press a undo button please add this option and fix this issue as its literally impossible to create your own presets"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Five Star!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than power director and kine master. If u don't like it u can uninstall it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app didn't meet my expectations. At all. I use a lot of Adobe products on my computer, a lot of creative could programs. This app was a flop for me. While cutting the video gets stuck every time I want to move forward, cutting takes ages; the pre-made titles are all kind of tacky & hard to edit after inserting into the video; last & worst in my opinion: the quality! I export it in 1080p & 30fps and it looks super pixelated - the raw material wasn't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use the free version of this app for basic/quick video editing and it's been great! They don't try to sneak a watermark in on your videos either, which is a non-negotiable for me. Solid app by a trusted company."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great features, missing the reverse clip option"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Terrible UI compared to other video editing apps. Interface is not optimized for most common mobile video aspect ratio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Literally the glitchiest and worst video maker I've used. It's even terrible on desktop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported footage looks glitchy/wobbly. I export at original resolution and fps, but the export makes my footage looks visually glitched, some kind of waves on the footage. It's unwatchable. On samsung s20"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wao... Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app too much bruv"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Such an useless app for video editing for Android... Couldn't render a 7mb file for almost 3hrs. Do not waste your time on this stupid app. A lot of far better apps available."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update, I have to give developers 1 star now, its still not available for S22 Ultra its been months. On Tab S8 scrolling and playback still little choppy. I gave up on Adobe. Just use CapCut, it miles ahead of Rush as far as basic functionality to create up to date videos for social media."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and professional quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wowwww very Niceeee üò≤ üëç üëç üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I select 3 to 4 media file it's not working what is this behaviour. Worst experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Enjoy being able to make quick videos on my phone that look like they took hours on a desktop using a lot of memory. My friends are jelly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice app but takes a lot of time to export..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used on my pc, buggiest mess ever. Every attempt to export a finished video makes the video export at 0.25x speed, I couldn't find a solution so I learned premiere pro (which I highly recommend compared to this)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It has no watermark :D"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"can not login on samsung z fold 4"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Soo much laah"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Taa"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rush It just spoiled my work. Waste of money"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good editing app. The best thing I like about it is you do not need to pay to remove any app watermark. Better than those apps which require you to pay."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very useful. Thanks adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like Tuco said in Breaking Bad ""Tight, tight, tight! Tight! Yeah!"""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic, I use Premier Pro and just used this app for the first time, I intuitively knew how to operate it and produced a decent clip in 30 mins, it has plenty of options, from auto tracking the main subject to changing the video size and applying adjustable transitions. Very easy to use. And uses my Adobe Premiere Pro subscription"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy peasy!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty versatile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very complicated. Not intuitive at all !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Login doesn't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"How is this app available on my old Note8 but is ""incompatible"" with my NEW Galaxy A22 Ultra? I thought the monthly subscription we pay Adobe was supposed to mean things get updated more?!?!?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"First time using it, quite easy to use - had trouble with the Pan/Zoom function not being clickable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesn't sustain the name Adobe. Miss a lot of useful functionalities that others apps have. Export format very limited and poor quality. Crash frequently. Gets very slow with few objects. Again. From Adobe I would expect something a lot better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Rush won't run on my Pixel 6 Pro with most recent ANDROID OS. 'Not compatible with this version."" Huh?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really nice mobile editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This has to be the worst video editing app I think I've ever used. So may bugs, nothing syncs properly, and it's pretty much just a waste of space. You are better than this Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There was an error during login. This is the app. It only shows this message, and I'm unable to open it. No way to login with google account, creating a new account or even using an existing account. You get this message before seeing a form to insert credentials. Android 12, uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's does what it says ,I used this for editing my vlogs and also if you get the premium one ya get more things"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"audio pitched down in app bug since the last update. sounds correct after rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No Hindi Language Fonts"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is great when editing small quick video-teasers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ts interface is easy and useful, but there are a lot of optimization problems when editing videos, Especially when editing videos, there are sound shifts and repetitions. and when i export the video i can't output correctly üëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"SO much quicker and easier to upload my movies and still pics in the desired order right into a Rush project! This is huge for my daily life!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad...very bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First time using this app and found it easy to use... its great that I can edit video on my phone..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"suddenly super laggy. unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, easy to use and intuitive! Love this app üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why is it so glitchy even while making a 30sec video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Yh pretty good for a phone Happy days üòé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Katai maja aa gaya editing me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I love the interface but the memory management is shamefully poor. Just upgraded to ""Premium"" and no improvements. Y'all are not living up to the software quality of the early Premiere days. . .four hours editing and I can't export in order to upload to my YouTube channel. Hope I can get my 35 bux back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great for cell phone use. Need to experiment more with it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏èü§ç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like this good üëç working and editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Has its issues"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Less features, no chroma key, little animation."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just bought the app in name name of Adobe, don't repeat my mistake...before you buy subscription do understand ...for the cross platform editing to work you have pay 700 ‚Çπ extra in desktop app..... In play store subscription Its just adobe rush mobile... And if you checking reviews after the purchase, sorry bro but understand your pain. ü•∫"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work at all. Can't start a new project or literally do anything. Decided to uninstall it within ten minutes of downloading because it was completely non-functional."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and does a great job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Instantly had app breaking glitches"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app is beginner friendly .Only things I miss is moss transition options and more layers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use...üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Needs an audio only export feature"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"it's adobe premiere pro but lighter"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't understand, I've been editing a 30s video clip but I can't export it. It gets stuck at 28% in rendering all the time, I left it for 6 hours but it was still at 28%. I've been editing this video clip with lot of care and the fact that I couldn't export it is so frustrating. Fix this!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There are many bugs in this app, please fix the bugs as soon as possible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Run great on techno pova2 Amazing üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Works great on my 2 year old Samsung Note 10, but not compatible with my brand new state of the art Samsung S7 tablet and now it's not compatible with my new Samsung S22 Ultra+ that it has already worked on, but now won't update?? It doesn't even show up in the Google Play for the S22! Is this some kind of joke? Seriously??? Very disappointed. The developers of this app bring dishonor on the Adobe name."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very good when it works. But just like any Adobe Premiere on any other platform and device, it's very buggy. Super unreliable if you plan depending on it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good but terrible for crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use, powerful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exelent mobile video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"great features but it bugs a lot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disappointing app. I have premium subscription but features are too scarce compared to other video editing apps. Graphics are too simple and not much variety. Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"coming from an novice this is the best easiest app i have ever used,, bar none but....full functionality on my s8+ phone but limited functionality on my s8 tablet. What gives Adobe?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I was download in my phone opp a16 but vedio isnt showing after i import vedio in rush .. no any complaint or option is showing please solve this problem only voice i working vedio isnt showing ..thanks rush team"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Video not showing up"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"What ever happened to importing your own audio/music?, why should I be restricted to the audio given?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"–ù–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–µ—Ç –≤ –æ—Ñ—Ñ–ª–∞–π–Ω —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º–µ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Parfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love all the features you have in Rush! It is easy to navigate and learn and if you have any issues you can request a feature or go to the how to videos provided to learn more. Can't wait to see what else is added in the future and can't wait to try Premier Pro!! üíúüíúüíú"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use with all the features I need"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"wow!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Eureka good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It more"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Has trouble sequencing and will not work with your 4K/8K mobile videos. They will not upload. Be warned that you will have loss if you want to use this as a mobile editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app with no ads. Just the quality to be expected from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Editing small productions takes a really long time. üôÅ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far I do the basics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very basic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Just need premium and you need to be a experienced editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need more music"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've recently purchased an android tablet (galaxy s7 fe) and was able to install Rush, however, it only works correctly sometimes... I just edited a short video clip and Rush won't allow me to export it to the tablet, it was working fine then all of a sudden, it's not; says there was an error saving to the disk. Contacted, CustomerService, about it. They were of no help. I'm only using 1% of my allotted space.. I'd reccomend, Premiere Pro, for bigger projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Nothing will export. Tried on my mac too but it crashes. Total waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Incredibly powerful video editing in the palm of you hand!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very much like my PC version. Great android editing tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good overall for a on the go editor.. slow sometimes, but I think it might be my phone.. it did randomly unlink some photos I had on the timeline."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Update August 2022. Their zoom effect only works on photos, which is extremely frustrating. Why can't I zoom in or out on video? It's literally the most basic effect. Frustrating and disappointing üòû would improve my rating to 4 star if I could zoom."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love the app, I'd love if the app had an option to export videos in a better quality. It pixelates videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Definately a quality editor and once you get used to using it, it becomes easier."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I impressed myself. Very easy. Very professional feel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"After a long time good to see Adobe premiere on Android that was a wish though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's good for fast casual editing, but you can't depend on it as your main editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What happened, this app used to be the best. Now it constantly crashes. Sadly, I think it's time to uninstall!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic application for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Decent. But when impoting video from a T7i the video pauses but the playback (audio) continues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Excellent."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have a fully payed version of this app ...At first it worked nicely but now my updated videos are loosing quality and getting pixelated .... not happy... really thinking to unsubscribe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb.... üòç User Friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Is this free or what"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really a worst app - changing my rating from 5 to 1 after rendering 1 min video. It created too many frame drops which made video not usable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very god"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice video editor with some advanced features üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I make my stream highlights on here! I love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wonderful editing app üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is a super good app! If you want a good free app for editing, this is the one you should download!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really good, needs reverse video feature. I know there's a web based tool I can use on Creative Cloud, but this is such a basic feature it should really be available."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty abysmal for a product made by Adobe. Works less than 10% of the time, has the tutorial pop up for how to split a clip of 90% of the time and lacks anything more than the must rudimentary features for editing. Add Luts, and fix the glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I edited whole video but when I went for exporting, it is struck now at 3% and not moving forward. What should I do now? I am using it in oneplus 8, this app is not good for android, on iOS it works wella and seriously this application needs a lot of updates..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It really gives you the good quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and convenient!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It takes forever to Load the preview come on Adobe you can do better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app comes with auto renewal. I was just charged for annual renewal without my consent or authorisation. Please beware."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app for gamers nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's great for when you're on the go and need to do editing for short films. If you're doing full production of films, just get the entire Creative Cloud suite. You'll get your money's worth. If you're a small content creator, Rush pro should have what you need. The free version is frustrating so I'd just spend the money for the full package."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best for tik tok. Really :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm running this app on top tier hardware (SD 888) but still it is very laggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So nice aap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Experience good on Google Pixel 4, except graphics really tiny. Would love to be able to rate the experience on Google Pixel 6 Pro!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editing is nice but it's useless if you can't render. Renders stall at random percentages and never continue. Sometimes I change something in the project and that will help but often I just give up and end up rendering it on my laptop..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This is an overall pretty good app. And it has made some improvements, but there are still some things that should be improved. I really wish the audio was easier to edit since it is hard to distinguish which part is where."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very useful for quick work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Done such a good job of staying on top of growth. This could eventually include key framing which would be amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick; ease of use...üëãüßê"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work. At all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn and use. Hope you'll add automatic sync to the beat feature one day, it will be perfect then üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app, going to upgrade my phone soon... This app seems to get me back in the mood to edit video, and shoot more..... It works just like Premiere...just figuring out all of the buttons. Will watch a tutorial soon...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My app keeps freezing during rendering , and making phone so hot that it feels like I could cook a grilled cheese sandwich on it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"wow!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened to rush suddenly. Video are not playing and shaking and glitching. Disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Look at your rate in store. This is not normal for adobe. you should work to enhance it. Where is video stabilizer and video tracker. And optical flow. We waiting the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. Love this app For mobile video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent on the go editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Export crashes"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great UI, easy to use, and is my sole video editor for hand-held content creation"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am a full Adobe suite user on PC. This app is great except for one reason and why I'm giving 2 stars only. I get an error every single time I try to export. I have literally tried every size format and setting. Very disappointing! üò© Not the level of Adobe I have come to expect..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless app Unable to import big files So what's the use of downloading this much big app Even inshot and kinemaster can do better job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great for quick editing of videos. I like the format, and adjustable volume control. Not sure what the other bad reviews were about. I love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Color correction isn't as good as premier pro, or photoshop. My main reason for downloading this app was because I thought it was as good as premiere pro and photoshop for mobile edits,so far im disappointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app will rune your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gosh... I've been looking for this one."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nc editing app ever I seen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it sucks, won't let me even see videos"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wowwwww this is so coolll"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't put any song from my device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Can't remove background video green screen can't not"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stucking time to time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Decent video editor, but it won't export any videos. Just keeps telling me to give it permissions in settings despite it already having all permissions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It stoped on Fetching projects and is not getting further on worse experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever when I'm fully done it tells me to pay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Many functions available with other phone apps are not available with rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lot of frame drops , even in 1 min video. Please work on it , it's very frustrating... Thank you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent for quick, low production videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely buggy on my Galaxy phone."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very simple and powerful tool that just works without BS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ÿ±ÿßÿßÿßÿ¶ÿπ ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Basic but Functional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Wish this could be as helpful as Express is with the videos, ready to make great social media videos but this is not the case."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please available this app for Samsung tab A7 and Galaxy M31s"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a good progam"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to export anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It just really bad on using the rest of my phone memory. The app literally have infinite loading and lagging playback on snapdragom 870. I have to close and open just to edit, when the infinite loading happen. PC premier already that bad, now mobile too?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Owsam app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Op application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very slow work karta hai ye app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Poor export video lagging"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app seems to have picked up a lot of problems aince I last used it. All of a sudden, playback is poor when editing, it fails to export often, and when it does export, the exported video flashes black randomly. It was great and I really hope it gets back to where it was, because this is not reliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and self explanatory in the basics. The more you dabble, you understand just how easy it is and they have help tabs set up. Highly recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I found just what i was searching for. All in one place. But, the fact that i can't see closely the screen of what i'm doing pissed me of."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Laughably bad. It's not just disappointing that Adobe made yet another useless product, but just how bad it is in pale comparison to the rest of the market. TikTok and IG Reels have not only more complexity and more tools available, but they also don't have the stability issues that Rush has in abundance. I got this app with CC, I wouldn't pay for it lol."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I give it a 4 star because I forgot how to save the vidoe do you need premium?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it! Super handy and easy to use. The only downfall that I've experienced is that it gets glitchy with anything over 15 min. So keep it under that and you're kosher, but it's annoying if you happen to go over, bc it gets pretty hard to watch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good but too litle options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing application still need some more elements and functions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't sign in. When i tap 'Sign up' or 'Sign in', the window just shows loading sign which isn't moving. And when i click on Google login, at first it shows accounts and when i select an account, it doesn't login to it and send me back to login screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Pretty good, but has a glitch where the audio gets super slowed down and there seems to be no fix. Only happens on some clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Gets professional results. Good and useful app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works fine and flawless as of this version. I'll update if I find any issues. People posting negative reviews either don't know how to use the app or take help from Google."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing apo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I've enjoyed putting videos together on the fly but the enability to add or change text kept me from rating this higher."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a worst app.. When I downloaded and opened first time it's lagged so much what i didn't accepted... So finally uninstalled"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Lagging a lot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever! I have installed it more than 10 times but it is not showing any preview window while editing only it shows the black screen. I have never expected this from @adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very useful and truly helpful even during crunch time! Highly recommended! üôÇüëå‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app for editing videos. It get stuck whenever I tried to do any actions. I'm uninstalling this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"On of the best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY THIS IS GARBAGE YOU CANNOT EXPORT YOUR PROJECTS MAYBE THE FIRST ONE BECAUSE IT WORKS PERFECTLY DURING THE FREE 7-DAY TRIAL ONCE YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY IT WILL NOT EXPORT GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ON TOP OF WHICH TECH SUPPORT IS USELESS BUT THEY DEFINITELY WILL BILL YOU EVERY MONTH"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't render. Shuts down unexpectedly. Tried restarting, clearing cache, etc. Just doesn't work at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good aplikasi sangat membantu sekali dalam edit video dalam hp."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant import your own audio or if there is a way its VERY unclear, immediately made me uninstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This stupidest program of all. After you add text graphic you can't change the text it just stays Title. I had take a picture in Instagram with the text to add it to the sequence and after the you just are not be able to add it to the beginning of the clip it adds the text in the middle in you can't move it. It is unbelievable that I am paying for this thing. Don't use it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This application don't install please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just bad i couldnt see nothing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Could not create project!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Probably one of the worst editing apps around. There are way better free versions like InShot. This is embarrassing. Get it together Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It reaaly do not deserve a single star it cannot import a 1 hour long episode only showing black screen on my 6gb ram mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I would not coment about the interface or features, but the reason for bad ux is that it crashe's while rendering. I tired rendering my around 1 min video for more then 5 times but every time it crashes at about 16%. Please fix that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app and easy to use but could have been better if the lags and bugs were fixed such as on my galaxy a33 5g it sometimes stops rendering. Otherthan that I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Free trail but so many issues won't sink with phone, can't share can't zoom in and out on video, no easy help. Was really hoping to buy this as I need to make teaching videos for a contract."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't even try operating on a phone. Ruined my clip"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ü§ôüèªü§ôüèªü§ôüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Please adobe fix this app and tell us"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm 53. It's so easy to use. If I can use it, you can too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Solid app with robust configuration options; however, the flaw is the music skips. I've tried removing/adding songs but the song(s) continue to skip on the majority of my videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Doesnt have enough options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The app is great. The adding text option is abit limited and takes quite some time to load the templates."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Before: The app itself us very good, but is having issues every time I open it.. Now: It Improved, but could be better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm a huge adobe user so 5star all the way for me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutelly amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Download vita."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app and helps a lot with my videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Come on Adobe. Lacks basic video editing features such as reversing a video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just rubbish, this app is very slow..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Literally does not render at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this. Super easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So many bugs :( it's a great editing app, if inky it would work half the time :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. Especially if you want to make video at a go. If you have a phone with a good camera, Premiere Rush will be the first app to download."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"All sorts of errors and problems with this app. The 3 dots on a project hardly ever work making it all but impossible to name it or delete it. Strange error when adding an image to project. Unable to trim a sound track (as far as I can determine anyway). I would have thought Adobe could do way better than this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Degrades video quality. Imported video that was 1080p @ 60fps. Exported at 30fps and noticeable hit in quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adding text to a video on a smartphone is anything but a rush. If you're going to add titles, plan on spending a little bit of time getting to look good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy mobile editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"OMG AHHH LOVE THIS APPP SO MUCH 5 STAR REVIEW ITS SO GOOD I WOULD HIGLY RECOMMEND IT üíïü•∞üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for voice over, video and audio editing..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Clunky liled the earlier adobe premiere app much better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"gud one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's INSANE how glitchy this app is. More often than not videos just will not render no matter what you do. I use the app for work and have several times spent hours editing only to be completely unable to render and am forced to miss a deadline. Now, on top of that, literally none of my videos will render at all. Content doesn't sync across devices, I completely gave up even trying. Text editing is a convoluted mess. Playback is glitchy. It's like they have it just to say they do. Boo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"doesnt work on my google pixel 6."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app would be wonderful if it worked correctly. The worst thing about it is that you try rendering a video and it doesn't work. No matter the size of the media you're trying to export, you can leave it all day and it gets frozen at a random percentage. The few times I managed to make it work, it was awesome."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tienen que dar la opci√≥n de poder usar sin conexi√≥n."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I hate rush. I only use it because I already pay for Adobe cc and I refuse to pay for another editing app when rush shouldn't be as trash as as it is. First you can't just add a text title. All clips have to touch so to get a moment of black you have to do a whole convoluted ordeal using an effect and I hate it. You also can't put in a solid color so you can't just add a like black frame spacer you also can't click a clip and trim it using numbers. Would not recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glitch, lag, whatever. Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Frustrating at best. How to I remove the payments? I don't want anymore and the app is designed to to hide canceling services. Stay away from this one."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loving being able to edit on the fly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for video editing üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Since registration became mandatory, the performance got unreliable and sometimes it doesn't even save the projects to the gallery, although it says it did. Just not good.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely and easy to use... Good content"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The potential is there but it won't export any of my projects. It gives me a double message, ""saved to gallery"" at the same it says ""error in saving file to disk."" Gives no other information üòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I just get learning"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Great editing app. Absolutely love it. But not if i can't publish anything after 3 videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Finally got to use this!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why is this in portrait? Coming from Adobe, why does this contain so less features compared to kinemaster? Adobe makes top class editors for pc, why not one for phone too? Look at kinemaster..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's free and you get a good wide range of stuff if you know how to use it u good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Everything is good but please make professional video editor for mobile üì± please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Too small. I'm struggling to move stuff around and I can't see the playback properly because everything is super tiny on my phone. Never had this problem on other apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have a Samsung s22 ultra. An apparently I am unable to install adobe rush on this advice. Who would have thought"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing super easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Perfect solution to editing while being broke üòÖ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is kinda useless without any stabilization features. If other apps can do it on the phone why can't this app have it? I specifically don't use this app anymore because it doesn't have that feature."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"this has got to be the quickest easiest user friendly editor tools on the market aimed at people who find it difficult to use Premiere pro because this is basically a dumb down version of it which is awesome in my opinion but just make sure your phone is powerful enough to run it because it might be a simplified version of premiere pro it requires a lot from your phone if you can't handle it then üì≤‚ùÑÔ∏èthe app will still work but it will constantly freeze and be laggy still highly recommend it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The perfect on the go video editing app. I used it daily for my channels"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty intuitive, lots of control over the image. Saves me having to move files from my phone to my computer and back again. Downside is I'm spending more time hunched over my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is very buggy. I managed to make the video, but it took way too long, because the app kept crashing during. It can take minutes for it play the video, even when I use small clips and my end result is less than a minute."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DELETE THIS APP FROM PLAYSTORE!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really bad. Buttons dont respond. Super glitchy. Very limited for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Mostly good, lots of hanging, rendering sometimes freezes, and occasionally while working it will for some reason close the project back to my project listing page. Needs alot of work, but when it does work it's super handy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Allow us inspect your butt so we can allow you to use this app. - adobe This reminds me of a southpark episode ü§£"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good on the go¬π"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Buggy AF. Feels like a half-hearted attempt. One star is because it has a habit of rendering glitched videos where the video hangs but audio continues. It happened many months ago with a large complex video; it just happened today with the simplest scenario - concatenating two short SD clips. Unless you enjoy redoing your editing, avoid at all cost."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't like it's interface"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and straightforward! Little slows down from time to time.......but that's OK considering the task! üôå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"In many case don't love to leave comments, but is it really possible in modern time that you are supporting only 4k images. So basically u cannot import image which is exported from the same corporation software with profi image (Lightroom). And message is terrible: ""couldnt import medias."""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dont install this App . It's very badly effect your phone , not given single star also , avoid download App please"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe premiere rush se beker app Maine aaj tak nahi dhekha aur ise 152mb ka kisne bana diya ye to 1kb ke bhi layak nahi hai mai to kahata hu isse bekar app duniya me to kya pure universe me nahi milega This Is very useless app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a terrible app! I installed it just to add music to a video and it's even incapable of something as simple as that! Music upon putting it into the project sounds lower pitch during playback, and the playback in general would only work for a few minutes before completely freezing! My phone isn't a flagship, but it isn't an old phone either (Z Flip3), so I don't see why that would be the problem. Honestly, just a waste of time. Was expecting better, as I use and love Premiere Pro on my PC"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to edit videos good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Thought would be good but i didnt like it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very versatile mobile program!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Add graphics doesn't load anything.. Now audio editing options are not available"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Most nifty editor in my pocket. Great sliders of colors, hues, saturation, shadows. Ability to stretch the file to frame by frame to edit is Best feature."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not good, can't edit how you feel you are stuck with there ways"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very convenient on mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's good for editing videos but not with pictures."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Has instances where the app does its own thing, lags out, drops frames when previewing. Overall app is good but riddled with random graphics and technical issues just as the full version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best video editors."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I would consider this app decent it worked properly. You're obviously more limited than something like Premiere but it does have some layering. My biggest issue is that the app won't render. Made a video 20 seconds long and it gets stuck no matter what I change or remove. Can't believe there is a paid version of this. Adobe has some of the most overpriced broken software out there"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is easy to use and have the basic features done well. There is still room for improvement, considering the mobile platform, but it is a handy app to have. Recommended."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusably broken. Crashes within the first few minutes of use, just resizing clips. Relaunch, FC, and clear cache does not resolve. Clear data and login forgets project. Issue loops."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Plese give me some money plese help I want to make big youtuber"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good good good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its a good app for editors who know Pr,good export quality,I have a request to adobe to add lumetri colour in the next update....overall one of the best editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Am a premier pro user an I use this am just feeling am on my system am really very enjoying it üòá"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"so epic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rush edits üçπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"it is great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Please include more features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give -5 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I find the app easy to use and with all the functions I want. However, it simply won't export! I can't export my projects on android, ipad or desktop. Rendering will not work. The app is therefore completely useless. *Update*. After many hours of trying different things I have worked out that I can only export my project if there are no transitions, no pan and zoom effects, no music, and no titles! This means the app. is still useless as a video editing tool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's glitchy. I think it is for high end mobiles, kos I used it with my note 10+ and it didn't glitch but with my s8, it was so glitchy. Apart from the glitch it's close to perfect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Rendering take some time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's amazing üòç üòç It's like premier pro wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,".. mmnnn2n n 2nd K.4....4 The y"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Faster shoot editing export and share"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great tools, very user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not exporting not rendering . Terrible app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like Me Out Like Me In"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very very bad performaning apps kinemaster is also cool and osm editing app compare to rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best best best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Noiceeeeee"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Lag Issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Please sir launch the Bangladesh Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great tool to use for editing. Simple, yet effect. Easy to learn and a great way to have fun with videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Features are nice but struggle to respond to my touch. It's a 50/50 chance it will freeze and stop working. Also the video is tiny and hard to preview."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't deserve even 1 star. It stops while editing. The vedios always hangs. At the time of exporting it just does export after 33%. So disappointed. Edited a 30 minutes vedio by again and again opening the ap because of the stoping issue. And it just doesn't export and saves. Don't download it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Its super basic and gets the easy jobs done. But it could definitely do with extra features, like a cut button, and a way to edit audio with a bit more detail - such as keyframed volumes and crossfades."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its better than any video editing software for mobile. Easy colour grading, many user friendly options. Overall its best software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice for quick video edits on the go, but not very intuitive when it comes to adding effects, text, graphics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Frustrating. Crashes and glitches constantly. It's ok when it works right. Not worth the monthly payment."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèæ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent, easy to use, and perfect at any time!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good enough for instant editing. Need to add some additional feature like auto match audio beat, freeze frame, more transition option, etc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great video editing features and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app for quick phone edits ü§©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too glitchy. Lag and choppiness make this program hard to stomach. Thought adobe could do better than this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The sound and music pitch and tone changes when import it in the timeline and when I go to render, it says it's in my gallery on my phone but is nowhere to be found. Adobe really needs to get their act together. Every application has some kind of bug. The programs would be great if they were more stable and less buggy and glitchy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app üíØ necessary to make video much better and nice üëçüèΩ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"One the best video editing app for mobile but missing few features üòï i.e No flexibility in export setting like you cant set frame rate at your own. Less transitions,Audio Fade in Fade out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Efficient"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes frequently, very slow video editing, and there are delays and audio errors with even the most basic edits. Very unsatisfied."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I expect more from an app that costs so much! Constant crashes which cause the loss of around 30 mins work. Buggy, and badly laid out. Kinemaster is better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't allow me to log in at all. Waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I was expecting more from Adobe, but it is quite behind other editing apps. And the rendering time is extremely slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It works for the most part. Stalls a bit which can make it feel buggy but it catches up eventually. Also I can't figure out how to make it do things I've seen advertised on Tik Tok. I still use it though and it's a useful tool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Experience used this application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very bad app This app is very lagging in my phone Gave it 2stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great video app editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"My graphic template for title only have 5 choices. The rest of your beautiful template I saw in youtube never available for me. I have been using this apps and did not see them at all. May I know why?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"You keep asking me to rate your app but I'd like to see that you listen to feedback at some point : you giv us all these cool features to edit so can we please have proper professional EXPORT settings, we make all this nice stuff in your app and then only get some kind of vague medium quality export setting, no come on let us choose at least the bitrate and custom resolutionS !! Don't dumb it down this is not iMovie ! 5 star when you fix this newbish export menu!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ÿßÿÆÿ±"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very buggy which makes the process a lot longer and then the export quality is the same as any free app that is quicker and more user friendly. I was expecting more from Adobe Premier"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it, literally just edited my Drone footage walking back from a waterfall üëçüèºüòè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for ad film"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great ...i.love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrid.... splice (the cheap phone editor) is 100xs better. And I use PrPro on pc all the time works just fine there. ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and fast ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really love the way I can film, edit and render video on the go, just a great product!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Can not adjust when the graphic comes in to frame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Crashes easily"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App is nice for basic editing but can't handle big videos like movies and video play slower in app then other, why? Even the speed is reset to default."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Does not have Lightroom curves and color controls. Exports only 1080. A clunky alpha product trying to make money. How greedy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported videos are very pixelated, not anti aliasing whatsoever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it super easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video capture not working. Says it needs permissions but I have them all on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is wonderful I can comfortably edit Vids"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I love Premiere Rush on my computer, but the app constantly crashes and is barely usable. Every time I try to load new clips into the project I am working on, the app can't handle it and shuts down. Very frustrating ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every video i render comes out looking pixelated like CRAZY! They aren't even long videos, just simple 40 seconds at 1080x1920, but no matter what I try rush pixilates the video. No point in using it if you can't even get a decent result from it. Also doesn't have a pan zoom option for video, it only works on pictures. Update: I've been trying my best to use this app, but it is so unbearable. Every video is pixilates and terrible to watch. DO NOT BOTHER DOWNLOADING!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wow just... This has to be one of the worst video editors I've tried yet. The most basic functions are missing. Unless there's some hidden menus that that give you basic functions like Cutting out parts of the video...you know pretty much the most basic task in any video, zero way to export the video how you'd like. Maybe if you have a premium plan they are there but I'm doubtful. Might just boot up windows 98 and use movie maker like I did when I was a child and it's a more powerful tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"ü™Ñüíñ‚ú®"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not good üò∂ Soo lagging and take much time in editing , not responding fast ! Not expected this form a good and reputed company . Please fix the bugs and responding time , so i think it is 4 start application because it have a unique timeline but due to some bugs it's responding good . - shubhammeenaind"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Way too many glitches. Especially when rendering."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works pretty well most of the time little slow and confusing with one video but it wants video need better transitions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Edit: 5 stars now since it's available on my tablet. Thank you :D Although there is a tiny bug on the audio for the tablet. If i add Rush audio that is included...the audio stacks up when i did a test on several of the songs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good mobile alternative for premier pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I want to add custom audio. And if this is ACTUALLY possible, then the UI Is really unintuitive.. but I will up the stars to 4 if this is possible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"No ads. This is a good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just really enjoy it more than I thought I would."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, but work better on pc"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ease of use fast for mobile video editing and posting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This would be an amazing app if it worked half the time. It's glitchy, slow, and it doesn't even work sometimes. ADOBE, please fix this app or make adobe express take video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like this apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Oh very good aap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Paid for cloud storage 3 months ago., never activated. Emailed but no responded"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Projects repeatedly get corrupted and the interface is laggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is a useless app, whenever i try to export a video for a while it work rendering but it suddenly stops/stuck at any point and not working any more."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good but bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëçüôÇ nice job guys."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constant crashes, super slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes and is slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Audio syncing is difficult"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a simple and easy app ,but I can't export my files!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok let's be honest, there is no such thing as the perfect mobile editing app, after trying almost all the options on the market, I have concluded that Rush is the closest thing to a mobile editor that exists on mobile, it is the most solid, i know in other applications you can use presets special effects, but never to a decent level, apart from that Rus allows me to open the project on my computer, that changes everything for me that I like to take things to another level, I recommend! #NINAFILM"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app for mobile video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is very amazing app I like it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"App is cool. But, it is too complicated to edit text lines when there is more than two or three words. Words are too small, it is not easy to select place and paste text."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't sing with this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app I've used for editing short clips, simple and beautiful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"good for editing small clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really good, except when it stops playing videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I really like Adobe Premiere Rush... Simply awesome software!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is good! But need to premium version free!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I love this app but it's have so many issues it don't run properly so I just stop using it because of that. Sad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I was able to upload my Media and audio and create my movie all on the same day flawlessly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't believe someone was paid to make this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great choice for editing videos wherever you are"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just want to say thank you very much. God bless you. üôèüåπ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for all video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's cool for something free. More to learn"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a waste of 150mb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"great app. Needs performance improvements, stability & For it to be available on Tablets."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love when there are no ads ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app is good for editing works like a charm"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to edit simple videos. Just what I needed!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So many crashes..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Grateful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptional performance"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app is a great tool for mobile visual content creators in an emerging age of content creation where there is an ever increasing demand for video Marketing for businesses and brands to advertise online through Social Media Marketing and Brand Strategy Campaigns. I would reccomend it as a great app and useful one at that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Heavy, sluggish lacking some features (like different transitions in the same clip), hard to edit with soundtrack and freezes when the project got a little more complicated."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Lot o problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A bit querky but super easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Ita a great app and it helps me out aoo much when I'm out away from my pc. I only wish that adobe RU could have a few extra features. But I guess premiere is there for a reason lol"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes eternally - can barely render a video. Try to render in every setting multiple times and you are lucky if one out of 20 attempts renders. Today I've given up and re edited in a different app. Honestly it wastes SOOOOO much time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome video editing software, very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"intuitive and practical"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Meesed up my video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why can't download samsung galaxy tab s7?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Oh God this is horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not syncing with mobile upload with web version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This is a very basic, bare bones editor WITHOUT a chromakey. Perfect to dip your toes into editing video. Just don't expect much from it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant save the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great fast easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love jt"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.. great app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I got so frustrated i almost threw my phone away, it felt like not being able to move my hands and legs, it felt paralyzing, you cant edit anything freely on this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Interface is clumsy and slow. It takes way too long for the audio waveform to appear under a video once you clip a section out of it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really fun editing app. A bonus with my photoshop purchase. :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Omg. I hate this app! It's synced to my laptop, but it never updates. Video clips are missing. It manages to delete everything, so I can't fix anything. And it can't upload to YouTube no matter how long I give it! I have to go back to my window, free video editor. At least it was consistent and I was able to upload. And the graphics are minimal."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not having a good experience. I have my phone and laptop linked, but the work I do doesn't sync well. It takes hours to download and upload. My free windows video projects take half the time. The graphics are limited. I thought I would be able to do more..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The Best App so far for Editing on Samsung A70. This has been my life Saver."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app. I really love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"amazing tool. Any1 who wants a video editor should get it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Well done."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"When it works, it's cool. When it doesn't it's yet another realization that Adobe abandons us Android users. Once I hit the 4 layers it's game over for my video. It glitches out and seems there's no real way to get back what you did so you either start over or give up. The desktop version works so well though. Im sure the apple versions hardly if ever glitch. But they can't seem to build in that stability for Android [even windows for that matter]"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I wish I cared enough to write a longer review about how bad this app is. Instead here's a summary. It crashes all the time. Video and audio do not sync or export correctly. The app fails when exporting and is slow and laggy when doing simple editing. You would think Adobe could do better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Solid app once u know how to use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app for editing. The interface is nice but what does that matter when your video can't even be properly exported. Get a different app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for beginners!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"perfetto"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It used to work properly with free stuff but then later after editing 5-6 projects, export doesn't work it loads for some percentage and then app gets crash.... Horrible experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't render basic added clips even with all apps closed and lowest possible quality settings. So basically it holds itself to the same rep every other Adobe application does these days. ""industry standard"" üíÄ Update: fully broken now. Imports don't work. Needs removing until a few months work has been done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Tbh I expected much more of it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Most people don't realize that you need powerful hardware to scrub and edit videos. If most of the reviewers could realized there's nothing that these developers can do, software with the same features Adobe has, you will run into the exact same issues on your phone. If you want to edit videos I recommend you purchase a workstation with an intel Xeon or AMD Thread ripper with the Latest Nvidia A5000. But for something on the phone, I expect it to take 20 mins just to render a 4K video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Allows me to rush just like I like"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best for edit!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App is too buggy keep on crashing on a 2min video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My videos refuse to sync to the cloud so that I can edit from different devices. I've done everything they said to do. I'm on the $35 a year plan, so I'm not sure if this has something to do with it or not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really well made application. Adobe never fails to delight us creators. Bravo Team Adobe !!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I couldn't find the 1 most important reason why I downloaded this program, was to rotate the video. Very disappointed üòû"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best for gameplay editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëåüèæ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So awesome to have the whole editing personal at my disposal!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Awaiting a refund"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"My experience went well although it's limited in the things that can be done , the finer details I can do once I open my pc , which allow my to edits to appear without me transferring the files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"(Edit 4/19/2022) I don't know why, but on editing and export, the music and video titles are all coming out messed up. This makes it difficult to work with for my business... Very fast, easy, and nice!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Crashes very often and quite slow on mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Like others have said, it's appalling how unresponsive and buggy this app is. Waste of time to even attempt to use. I would expect more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and straight forward"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app truly COULD be a 5 star experience....if it wasn't so glitchy!! When it works for the first 5 minutes after opening, it's great, I have no complaints. After that 5 minutes? I can't edit video without the app freezing or glitching. When scrubbing, the video clips freeze and won't progress. It takes forever waiting for the app to load while editing. PLEASE, developers, try to fix this issue. This app could be amazing. I would even pay to use it if it didn't have these terrible glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"itz a rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not easy enough for what it is"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Adobe Rush let me edit aby videos I needed, rather for a school project, or for an other friend. Only problem is that it runs very slowly, exporting it takes a long time, it overheats my phone, and sometimes crashes. With those cons, it doesn't outweigh the pros for me, at least with the amount of features it has"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is sooooo good perfeckt"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Dear Rush Team, pls add greenscreen option as well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App was great. Now it seems to fail when doing anything. What would take me 30 minutes or less to edit now takes hours due to waiting or having to close the app several times. Very unhappy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Finally android users have a usable video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"More convenient than editing on may laptop!! Good thing the Adobe Apps are included on my subscription with them."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't export video with any setting and plenty of space on my phone. This app is useless. Error Code doesnt help either. The fact that the devs believe ""Some Error Occurred"" is proper debug language for the end user is proof of adobe's lack of concern with the performance of this app. Save your money get something else."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I used to like the app, but it goes into an error of saving files after exports on your project. We more improvements on exports for devices."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You cut is better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The user experience has gotten better, but I no longer am able to render any projects on my Pixel 6. So the mobile app is useless to me now. Sent a message to developer over a month ago. No response. Please fix the app and customer service."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes often"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It works but it's so incredibly basic that it's not really usable for many things. There are literally zero options in the settings. There also seems to be no way to split a clip in half. I'm a paying Adobe customer for over a decade and just hoped for more out of this. VN editor is much faster and actually has a great layout and features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Yay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Greatest app for video editing üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app let's me do some great things for video editing but it's often glitchy. The text feature has not been working for song time. The playback often stalls or doesn't work. I have to restart the app to get the playback to work. And there's no reverse feature, even though it's been requested by many users for a few years now. So if I have basic video editing needs, I'm okay with using this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I use to love editing with this app. It's freezes every second. I can't make any changes without it booting me off"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable I've edited a number of videos on this app with great results. I don't know what's happened in recent months but it's simply not usable any more. The app is slow, lags, glitches and eventually crashes. It simply isn't fit for purpose anymore which is frustrating because it was my go-to editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"easy in use, love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible... it just spoiled one weeks worth of work and put a huge lag onto my video after exporting... it also would not let me export my video again, Additionally, I had to roll back drivers on my new HP to get rid of the green and pink pixelation which leaves my color grey on the pc screen. AND! I HAVE TO UNINSTAL AND REINSTALL EVERY SINGLE TIME I WANT TO ACCESS MY VIDEO TO EDIT ON MY PHONE :( :( :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Could use some additional features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This absolutely exceeds my expectations. Another top quality Adobe product"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Black screen problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good and it work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Major features that just do not work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best mobile editing app... literally ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've paid over $100 for adobe am using RU and only got 2 films pumped out tried making my 3rd and the app won't run. I'll go back to my $30 app thanks, let me know when you've fixed your problems ADOBE."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage app, won't upload, won't export, just frozen and glitchy no matter what you do. Don't waste your time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible app, froze multiple times while trying to export a 1 minute video. Would not recommend to anyone unless you want to spend hours waiting only to realize it's just frozen (for the tenth time)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works exactly as I feature"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app Very easy. and useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When exporting freezes cant finish up videos but i pay for this every month"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I really love the Adobe Rush app, yet I need to use several other apps to achieve my goal. GREAT APP...NOT FREE, because I have a creative cloud subscription, so I expect more than what I can get on the app store. There's a lot of room for improvement...we could make this the best video editor app on the planet... provide us with truly powerful and professional looking graphics/effects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Difficult to use, loading takes long time sometimes not responding"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ü§©ü§©ü§©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for trimming your films on set"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app is easy to use but robust enough to do everything I need to do. Works great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes all the time and bogs down"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Dick and hit a clip With the wip and lip"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very Great for your on the go phone videos! Can probably do even more! Adobe rarely disappoints, and there is a free version!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Still Glitches alot of the time. I wish they would spend more time fine tuning this app. It has the potential to be a game changer."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy on the go to produce high quality content with sound, captions and transitions. Crushed it #Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It has issues. It is frustrating having to wait, reload and fight the software. When it works, it's pretty good. I wish it worked reliably."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering rarely works, seems to fail 60% of the time. The project selection page is incredibly unresponsive and slow. I'm left wondering if it's lagging or if they forgot to code touchscreen controls into that page of the app. The internal feedback continually prompts for a password and erases your feedback message each time you attempt, even though I access it from the app where I'm already logged in, ie internal feedback is also useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'm still none to happy as full premiere customer rush still needs looking into as its leggy and it would be nice to update the features as pose to the same for over a year now.. my laptop is broken so its mobile sleidts only ‚úåüíöü¶æüôè once iv gotten to use the phone version ill have a better outlook but yea upped for 1 üåü to 3 stars üåü"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Couldnt even sign in, super bugged, disappointing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its definetely a little bit rough to use it but it sure does the job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well even on my old phone (galaxy s8 eu version)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not good for me...my country ip is blocked"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Fine for basic editing, but missing a lot of features Of consider essential. One of those being there's no way to reverse a clip, which is crazy to not have."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible Quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great stuff! Love the APP!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far, no crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for quick editing doings"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I have us a different video editor for a while but when I used this it was good but not the best one I've seen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Is ""Rush"" code for ""Crash""? If so, then it is an excellent name for this app. Crashes non-stop and re-starts every time a small edit is made."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It's so good for quick edits. There's so much functionality that no other app seems to have. My only issue is the weird way it ties audio clips to video clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best Video Editor for Android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"WOW! I can actually edit videos on my phone in a semi-professional way! Over all functional and useful, a great way to prepare media on your phone for other social media outlets. Could still use minor GUI improvements like specific ""In-Out"" value inputs for time remapping n' such. Over all 4.5 stars (Build: Samsung Octa-core/ Sanpdragon 888/ 12gb RAM)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I still have a hard time with some features, but at the end I am satisfied"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cancelling my subscription: Since the last update (""stability improvements"") I can no longer export videos. It used to be quick but now the progress bar goes to a random point between 4% and 33%, then FREEZES. I tried waiting it out today but after 22 (TWENTY-TWO) MINUTES I was at 36%. The length of the video I tried to export was 7 seconds / estimated 10 MB. UPDATE: Before cancelling, I managed to get one (1) THREE SECOND video exported. It was corrupted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"While unique in concept the solution fails to deliver enough features to make up for poor performance let alone make it worth installing. The UI is clunky, slow to respond, and requires exiting each time you want to delete a project. The app does not provide any plugins to cloud other then Dropbox."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's simple enough to use, render quality is fine. It's missing gif export option"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good and has came a long way."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"As long as it doesn't crash in the export section, it's a great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love it, just wished it had some video fxs other than transitions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not usable, when I import a video clip my audio for it super slow. I don't see how to fix this issue. I mean why doesn't it just import the video with the audio at the same speed like it should?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i tried to edit a video and the video i see on the display is just black it also very jankey and very glitched this didn't work out for me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps freezing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Some great things but some not so good. Can't export in 4k even when I updated files to 4k video and yes I have the paid version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe... Awesome as always!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Meh."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Decent features, a lot of obvious design flaws and accessibility is low. Why a custom thumbnail option would not be included on a social media oriented workflow app is beyond me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëçüèø"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, very easy to use if you're familiar with video/image editing software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wooow Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is fantastik!!!!!!!! Yay nft MP4 editables"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"to bad can't landscape"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simply Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What's with Rush and glitching your audio? Editing on a phone just can't be good I guess"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"For basic use it is good app but if you are a heavy video editer like want croma key and overlayering features this is not for you but its export high quality video for me this is best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible. Music skips after render. Super slow and hard to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"What handy video editor. On the fly editor with professional stuffs. Great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Had to update my review. This is a terrible product. Rending a 30 minute video sometimes too hours to do. And thats only if it didn't result in an error. The cloud stuff fails to sync all the time. I wasted 4 months on this product until I finally found Kinemaster. Please don't waste your time or money. Go with Kinemaster. It's soooo much better. I render 10 minute videos in like 5-10 minutes max and then I'm ready to upload to youtube. Please don't go with this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's excellent but you could just add a little more features pls"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So small amount of possibilities to edit anything. I wish here would be more tools to make videos look nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Had a few issues with the zoom function being greyed out that I couldn't figure out, but this is an absolutely awesome video editor for on the go. Pretty quick and easy if you're familiar with editing basics. Love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great for me!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to used this apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very basic, would have expected more functionality and features from an Adobe video editing app, but does a quick and easy job of basic projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is really great Adobe keeps making us happy am really surprised how easy it is to use and smart makes me feel I have premiere pro with me anywhere I go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Shockingly bad for Adobe. App has permission to access all media, pretends to export a file, but then nothing is there. I found out later I'm not the only person who wasted their time with this useless app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good mobile video editor with great features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love ot so easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adobe does not do user-friendly very well at all.. you either know how to use it accidentally or you don't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Thanx adobe for this app in Android But please fix bugs .. its very slow when i edit in high frame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The timeline video's timing is inconsistent, it cannot play audio correctly to save it's life, and after you persevere through all of that you can't even export. I don't know what the issue with this app is, but the impression Im getting is that this app is doing to much. I feel like I need to have a phone processor from the future in order to export anything. Incomplete product"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app for mobile üëåüèΩ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful with many editing features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A swift app that I am enjoying using."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ÿ™ÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ≥ÿ¶ ŸÑÿß Ÿäÿ∏Ÿáÿ± ŸÅŸäŸá ÿßŸÑÿµŸàÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸàÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ∂ ŸàÿßŸÑÿßÿ≥ŸàÿØ ŸàŸÑÿß ŸäŸàÿ¨ÿØ ÿÆŸäÿßÿ± ŸÑÿßÿ∂ÿßŸÅŸá ÿßŸÑÿßÿ∫ÿßŸÜŸä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm not super familiar with video editing. But I tried to edit one video to color correct, trim, and add a fade to black. Using the app is great, but the video comes out bad. Playback in the editor is choppy, which I thought might be a processing issue. But then it exported that way. Not a good first impression. Downloaded some random other app and that one works. Pretty disappointing. If it worked properly, this would be much better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I heard this is good So i like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless. I tried making a simple two clip video: one 12-second camera recording paired with a 42-second screen recording with microphone audio. The first clip was fine, but all of the audio on the second clip was erased and replaced with this low growling that sounds like a snoring tiger. How does that even happen? I wish I could share the clip with you all to show you how absurd this is."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It‚Äôs really awesome."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Guys this app is seriously buggy. Is it still in beta? Because I'd be embarrassed to release this as a full version. I have successfully exported a couple of videos now - but not without lots of restarts, loss of work, patience testing controls (and sometimes lack thereof) and a pathetic inability to save without exporting. (autosave is far from trustworthy from experience). I've been using Adobe products for over a decade now which is why this app surprises me. This app needs serious attention"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great once you learn how to use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Update broke but they have fixed it since then"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great app that allows me to do everything i want however the app is incredibly clunky, freezes a lot, glitches etc. And often has to be closed and reopened."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love the interface, but rush is very demanding on your phone's processor. I get a pop-up when I upload media but I usually click the ""wait"" option instead of rebooting the program. Basically once you learn, it's qwerks, it works good enough. It has multi track layers unlike a lot of video editing apps, love that... but the heck! You can't reverse footage. Great program it's just missing a couple basic features and it's no so much it's buggy... it just feels a little sluggish sometimes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good Update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is useless it shows only black screen, don't waste your money and time here"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I constantly ha e it crash and all my hard work lost"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So good so far."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Finally. A easy way to edit on a phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Playback and exported videos are very jittery, please fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now it's basically broken. Don't waste your time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's the best phone editor that I used."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not bad at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Loved it but has errors a lot and won't load graphics. I had to Uninstall and reinstall for it to work not once but 3 times over the last month. It stops responding often, especially when trying to add effects. Although it is extremely easy to use and understand the issues it has wins the overall review. Once it's all fixed I will stick with this program but for now I have to switch editing apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Video enchance AI are update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always crashes, my phone has 12gb Ram and a performance processor still it says app isn't responding. It's a useless application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tried to make an video and my screen started to glitch. I immediately felt the app and the rest of my phone was fine. So that concluded that is was the app that had been glitching."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Had to re-download the app because of an that didn't allow me to access my projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just two clips and one sound, export size 50Mb and this app stuck in rendering from 8 hours/28 percent. Also, made multiple attemts earlier but stucked below 8%. Tried clearing cache, but in vain."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy and fast video editor ! Tnx :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome on the go app for mobile video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty got to use on your cellphone and make vertical content, however still very limited comparing it with Premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"i am wishing that the editing in vertical way /screen is possible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like everything, the animations, the font of texts, they're fine. One problem is that when I exit the app, I thought it save from my gallery, though it did not. It only saved my project, I don't know how to export the video to my gallery. I'm using mobile, is there any way to do this? Thanks.. üôÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm an Adobe CC user and I can confirm that Adobe has managed to make Rush even buggier than Premiere Pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for a phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"After update . Cant render all the vid . Samsung s10 5g phone model . Hope you can fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash city. Absolute garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, and pretty easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's easy and straightforward to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"How to purchase Adobe rush in Pakistan?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is very good apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Sliders don't move naturally now way to make the preview full screen or adjust the amount on the screen it takes up. The app works really well. The exported video looks a whole lot different than the video that is color graded."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazingly easy to use i can throw a project together in the morning without a problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I love and admire what adobe has done for on the phone but its not ready yet. I experience some bugs and export problems. If they fix this Ill be happy to pay for a full subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I enjoy the workflow and like overall conception of the app, but boy does it need optimalization. It's slow to the point of being unusable. How is it possible that a billion dollar company delivers such a poorly executed product?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not bad."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Had good fun with it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Buen√≠sima para ediciones cortas y de calidad media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Does so much for free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was good, but doesn't work on s22 ultra, can't render videos in any resolution. It crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"No words. Just an amazing app. I do my all editing on this app.i throw my laptop because of this app. Specially the 4k video option. Worth every single penny....."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing üíïü§©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's a start. The Android version clearly needs some TLC to work out the bugs. Artifact clips kept showing up in the timeline making me think there was an actual clip. Then I would try to edit it out & mess up other clips. Export took 3 tries to get it out. Kept freezing. If I'm having trouble on my hardware, I can't imagine what it's like if you have a lower performing phone. Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 256 GB storage 12GB memory. 1080 clips w/straight cuts & 2 stirred ramps 2min."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even get it installed... Two different devices same error."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The audio has wrong pitch and can't fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good and so easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It was good but have to improve note"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice and fast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Difficult to use Least it works on pixel 6 pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bomb. Com :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't bother using or downloading it, especially Don't pay for it !!! you can create a video, but once u try to render it won't work, i have tried on my phone and my windows laptop, it freezes while rendering, looking online it seems to be an issue from 2019 !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I really expected to hate this. I use premier pro and figured something being edited on my note 20 would be stupid and unbearable. I'm pleasantly surprised at how everything worked. It was intuitive and it didn't destroy my system resources and make for a slow process. I'm having fun just playing around at the moment. Would have 5 stars if I saw an option to easily reverse your footage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Simple and easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"BUGGY. I want to love it. When you duplicate projects they won't open. Existing projects are being""fetched"" but never open. I expect more from Adobe. I have to Uninstall and re-install everyday to actually use it. Please fix this!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The PC and app never sync up. I have to delete the app and then reinstall it if I want it to sync. Logging out and back in doesn't work. I'll edit on the PC some, come back to it later only to not be able to see any of the video I had just worked on 2 hours previously. Then you can only see it on the phone from there on. Just shows red where the video was. Concept is there but in reality it just doesn't work as advertised."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love the app. I use it all the time on my Galaxy s10. The effects never load, though, so I can never add text. Transitions work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app I've ever used on my own device. Simple to navigate. Brings blurry faded videos to life. Don't believe me go to ShowBoat Peasy on YouTube and take a look. Thank You Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I would like a little more effects on here like me being able to use some of the effects I got on my actual Adobe but other than that I like"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Freezes constantly and won't upload pics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good aplication"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"great app for editing videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Completely inconsistent, always having sync issues and losing projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"doesnt support mkv format"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"worst video editor app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used to be a good app but it is unusable at this point. My projects lose color when imported or exported and it has severe lag and input issues once content is more than 11 seconds long."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Needs a ton more features. Way to basic to be of much practical use üòï"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app congratulations"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool app It has cool features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Poor colour management tools which is both surprising and dissapointing from adobe. Other free vid ed apps have far better tools for the job. So did not bother to go any further, dont know about the rest of app facilities. Adobe you should be ashamed of yourselves. Thuroughly unimpressed gave 2 stars as it did load vid and work with good layout. About to uninstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My videos have gotten botched three times already bc of the app. Feel like crying bc I've put in hours of editing. The sync doesn't work, randomly says files can't be found, rearranges clips by itself.... don't waste time with this app I hate this so much"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app. It can't do nothing. don't waste your time and data"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Video never shows only audio is running."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's very loyal to Premier: It crashes all the time and it's hard to process!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It so better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works well for me i like the similarity to premier pro. Only issue is crashing during rendering normally when using 4k clips or a 10 min+ project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not a good app. Very buggy and hard to use. It freezes and crashes a lot. Very disappointed in Adobe for this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is more akin to a beta product. Had lots of issues before getting it to work. (Sign in/out is your best friend for solving issues with this app). However, the most disappointing thing is that it has no way of reversing a video. This is one of the most basic functions that all other video editing apps have. It can't be a real limitation, most likely, they left it out on purpose."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I really like it. I did have to Uninstal it to get graphics to load. Hopefully won't have to every project like some said."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Most features won't work. Just filter work...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not actually ready for prime time. Sometimes titles and other graphics load. Much of the time they don't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Makes creating videos for social media easy and fun!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage! Incredibly slow! Pitches down and changes the audio! Produces video quality pretty much a potato! Renders way too slow! My phone is very fast, so I'm very shocked for Adobe creating this trash app! Uninstalled!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wish it had more of what pc version has but it does more of what you can hope for for free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not Bad ites good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As a professional video editor, I found Rush easy to use. Feature depth was surprising. I could see using this for straightforward edits of material shot on my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Easy to use features, but it crashes 3-5 times throughout a project on my Galaxy Note 10+. Have to uninstsll/reinstall and often lose progress. Great tools but kind of a pain!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad ...... Not at all working properly...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"3 for first video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing epic photos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app keeps crashing or lagging. I also can't delete old projects, when I try the app freezes. They have some nerve asking us to pay for this...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just as bad as Premiere Rush on PC. Buggy, slow, overly designed to the point the UI slows the app down. I do not understand how Adobe is an industry leader with software as crashy as theirs. Literally couldn't even test the app. I downloaded it 10 minutes ago and all I tried to do was cut together some nice looking footage I have on my phone and it has already crashed; not that it liked viewing my media in the first place, it refused to give my videos correct thumbnails for some reason"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"User-friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Mamamia. I have a premium yet the graphics and everything are not working. I will withdraw my subscription. I don't understand, this is Adobe service that I expect great service. Kurwa."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot upload footage from Dropbox. It appears to be working - albeit very slowly - then it just gives up and shows 'create new project'."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This app includes some basic editing feature that are not to be found in other apps that are popular. Of course editing in a pc is much better, effective and efficient but for a mobile app its impressive...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptional at quality editing. Easy to learn and there's so much you can do with it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For the past month I have been having such a difficult time with this app. I am ready to cancel my membership."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Took a couple of mins to learn it, but it's pretty easy and very effective."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App got so much potential however, buggy as hell which makes it unusable!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio shows it is playing but there is no sound"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Mostly a buggy experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is useless, titles never load. The video takes forever to open in the app. 0 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hangs all the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"An excellent app for quality video editing on the go. You can record and edit all from your mobile device. Super amazing! üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"it has been getting better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After a couple days using the app it stops downloading my videos from the cloud and I have to uninstall and reinstall it to get it to work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Oooooh my gosh. Read reviews and blogs before downloading. Everyone will tell you this is garbage. After hours of very buggy, frustrating editing, it would not export the video without throwing audio out of sync. Looking this up, it's apparently been a problem since the app was made and there have been no solutions. My final solution was to export without audio, download a different editing app, bring the video from Rush to the new app and add audio. So many wasted hours."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Graphics aren't loading! Rest all is working fine"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Graphics won't load, fix this issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app makes it very easy to correct colors and light from videos on your phone üëåüëå great addition to the Adobe apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exelent app i love itüíï"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Non stable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I don't like to leave critical reviews, but it feels bad that I'm paying adobe every month and the apps they advertise are not working correctly. If Rush functioned the way it was supposed to then it would be great. I would never expect people to pay me for something I'm not honestly delivering, and I'm not sure why adobe thinks this is acceptable - especially when they are capable of so much more ü§î"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I expected more of Adobe... it seems they like neutering any mobile app they make for some reason. While others offer feature rich fully functioning multi layer video editing for MUCH less subscription fee, Adobe is offering a basic editor with meager assets available at a price about 4 times more than other more feature rich apps! If the price was lower, I'd use it with my own assets, but for over 100 per year, it's a bit much for a mobile only app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm a media production student, and having the ability to make quick edits to my projects while on the field would make my life so much easier. Disappointingly, Premiere Rush is basically unusable to me for a couple of reasons: firstly, the app isn't available for my $900 tablet, yet it's available on my smartphone?!? What gives? Secondly, certain file types that I work with often aren't supported on Rush which is very disappointing. For example, XMF files, which are common for Canon cameras."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is shockingly bad. Laggy, doesn't connect to the Internet, just a complete joke. Do not download."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for quick editing. My go to was always videoshop before but Adobe rush is so much quicker especially for cutting scenes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really amazing app for editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's hanging too much . Plz fix that issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add text. Graphic page won't open. Keeps loading and becer opens. Fix it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Better but it's still rendering my videos in such poor quality that it's still not worth using"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy and Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's txt(graphic) functions are not very user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Open until yesterday I was editing and putting together videos for my work. I pay the premium price of $9.99 a month for this app but as of now it will not edit, upload, open files so I'm pretty frustrated. I've also tried opening it up and accessing it through the Creative cloud app which I'm also paying the premium price for and that's still a no-go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like that you can create layers, you can see the audio meters and that it's fairly intuitive. Sometimes things act a little weird like today I had graphics multiplying themselves for no reason while I was moving them around, but maybe it's because I'm on a mobile device."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Bugs are there"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't understand why this is highly rated. Its laggy, jerky interface, adding titles just doesn't load the library, and it freezes.. I even torn sync off, no difference. I am on a pixel 6 with a very fast connection and the leading competitor app seems to work very smoothly. I prefer the Rush interface but it's just unusable. It's it just me? I've rebooted etc, no difference."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good but some hang in phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lots of bugs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't load downloaded or edited audio. Only the garbage clipart audio that comes with it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Application is very good but project is crashing so many times. Please fix this issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I do not recommend. Rendering doesn't work, there's a strange strip on the edge. Does not match frame rate.Poor possibility of color correction. Unable to create sequences manually. Cannot rotate from horizontal to vertical and vice versa. However, trimming works well, it's quick and intuitive. I am disappointed at Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is easy to use and has plenty of features. Unfortunately, this app will not save nor work properly. Everytime I return to work on my project, it fails to load and I've went through their help center to either restart the phone or reinstall and I've lost 2 projects. I was on the 3 day trial and on my first day of the subscription and nothing but problems and disappoinment on this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's so difficult to use this app. I don't think devs understand that people who don't have very big phones or tablets also use this app. Smartphones are small and not accurate like using a mouse. The timeline is so small, it's just impossible to use this app, unless you're doing some very very basic editing. So yeah if you guys don't optimise the app properly for phones, it's over."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very worst app.not installing .but my mbs r gone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Speechless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusably slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best experience with mobile editing but ...some time lag of software some places"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Failed to export video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible - Cant even see the video I have uploaded - Shocking for a app made by adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Realllllly bad. Slow. Doesn't let me delete. Constantly crashes. Really outdated feel and super clunky ux"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Best Experience For Editing Videos and Many More"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not totally satisfied"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For editors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app deserves a 5 star review. Wow. Just wow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Typical Adobe product...has to be a bug somewhere. My exports get stuck at 66% no matter what I do. Shame because it's actually super easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's pretty cool, very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very gooood"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app parformance is very better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"f u, i edited simple stuff, and i got blank space"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Easily the worst video app Ive ever downloaded. It crashess all. The. Time. Premiere pro on my laptop works so well, why cant the developers get this right?!?!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too many glitches, doesn't allow me to edit on my phone, can't add titles etc!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty painful to use. Slow and clunky."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just needed simple video trimming without a watermark, Adobe rush did that effortlessly and there looks to be a ton more features if I need them. üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nothing works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe Rush is the bomb! I had two videos that I needed to be put together and colored sequenced and it worked out very well easily. Just choosing the two videos and the transition and everything is audio synced and video synced."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe.. what are you doing ?? For an official Adobe app .. this is terrible!! Will not allow me to upload and edit some videos.. its says I'm not connected to WiFi when I am .. its just all round bad and can't believe this is the best a massive and well respected company like Adobe can come up with .. terrible .. shockingly terrible !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use in the best part is, the app is free. üôÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"There are so many features that could be added to this app. I use Capcut and Inshot and they are better apps than Rush for little or no money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Fair review time! I've been using this to make ads, and I would like to see a 24 frames per second feature. 30 frames looks terrible in my opinion and my phone films in 24, so please add."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Made the video necessary for my business. Not sure if it's better than CapCut but I will give my report once I know!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not even worth it for the giggle. An app very worthy of It's rubbish set of reviews. For me, it was OK for a while but now I can't open any projects with titles, I can't add any titles to new videos and I can't rename anything. Adobe, I can't beleive you charge people for this. Horrible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Incompatible with many media formats."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"New amateur user, excellent thus far!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I previously published a scathing review about the constant crashing, but I will temper that slightly. I've just discovered that signing out and back in seems to fix the ""cannot open project"" issue. Not sure why, but for those struggling with the app it is worth a try."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Chu** chatni bekar khatni .....tao review dilam...üëÄ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Seriously made me sick waiting to render a 3 minutes clip.. Sucks.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crushing when exporting useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast & easy to learn on my Pixel phone. Outstanding toolset for mobile use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app has character. It may seem buggy, however one just has to think about alternate paths to a desired outcome. Put in perspective, this is an insanely powerful smartphone app -- more than a game changer, it's a world changer. Think about it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great app as I love all adobe apps, but add title function dies not work at all. Just keeps loading and there is no end. Pls fix it. Pixel phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So much potential for a quick simple video editing option but the are some glitches that need working out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I was a big fan of our director, but rush does just about everything the other app does and has no bloat. It's easy to use on the small touch screen of a phone and facilitates multiple tracks and video layers. Love it for in phone editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It used to be decent, now it's just awful. It doesn't even load the graphics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loved the app for so long but since the last update The audio and video of my imported clips get out of sync. This makes the app basically useless. Until this issue i would have given it 5 stars hands down."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App just hangs while editing. Non intuitive user interface. Struggled a lot to add text in video couldn't do it even after having premium. Deleting projects is nightmare, try 50 times then it works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is more effective app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to edit video in a quick way but still with a lot of tools available"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"CRASHES REGULARLY. I cant change any colors in the graphics or even load more than 3 30 second video without a crash. Regularly finding new ways it crashes. MONTHS later and still no change.. still crashes routinely. Nothing has changed.. a year later."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I paid for the ""pro"" version and my Graphics are not even loading. And it's not because of my internet speed. My speed is fine."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"graphics won't show or load. Newly imported clips play at 6x speed for no reason. Complete garbage. I can't do titles and whatnot. Customer service had me on w atleast 6 people, call disconnected after 30 min. Still monts later. Bad. Uninstall re install. Back and forth. BUGGY. Shame."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome! The fact that I can make videos on my phone which such variety and ease is unbelievable!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"My only problem is the design üò© Of the app its too I don't know too much some things are over kill taken up space"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Some bug with this update. Can't place the audio at the right place. It keeps on going to the right side if thr timeline on its own if you select an audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Video and such is fine, the audio is terrible. A clean file gets wildly choppy once brought into the app. and then will produce a final product that usually has the audio degradation in it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For a company and product that is so extensive. This app is total trash!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is not an easy app to use and is very clunky. Just adding music is not simple and trying to fit in with the video timings is almost impossible. Maybe if I were to use this in a laptop it would be better but in a mobile it is not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The graphics doesn't work, looks like it's downloading but no progress. And when I deleted the projects doesn't go away. Still can't get rid from any previous projects. My phone is note 20 and this sss doesn't work well!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't work, videos just lag, the graphics never load, it crashes a lot and the thing is that i have a oneplus 9 pro so it should in theory be able to work properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"why in god's name would i not be able to just CROP a video to a format besides the 4 offered. The crop option just adds a black bar to the top or bottom of the image. I think I didn't survive that train wreck and am in fact in purgatory being punished for my earthly sins."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great except for a lack of a reverse feature. Such an omission makes an otherwise great editing program not worth keeping on your device when you'll need a second program anyways."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Super unresponsive and cumbersome to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"One of the worst editing app ever seen!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad program"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Glitchy and unresponsive. Playback of videos is jumpy. Currently prefer using inshot for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Deleted my entire project and I have to log out and log back into Creative Cloud to trigger the sync. Needs a LOT of work.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app was working fine until it wasn't. My videos come out glitchy and the audio in slow motion even though it's at normal speed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I can hardly use the app. It's extremely buggy. I have a galaxy s21 ultra, which should have the processing power for video editing. But whenever I load a project, the video preview runs for a few seconds, then freezes no matter where I scrub through the timeline. It's a very frustrating workflow and needs to be polished better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Why i can't get graphics?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The sound can be glitchy if you are trying to do a voice over. The newest glitch was uploading my video and it showed the audio bar working but no sound. Tried it with my phones stock video editor and it worked fine. This is a new glitch and nothing has changed from the last video I made. I am disappointed that I have paid for this product for over a year now and have had better results with a basic video editor that comes on my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately this app just isn't there yet. great idea but I run a google pixel 4 and it cant even load a transition let alone change the speed of a clip without crashing. They would be smart to take it off the market and re attempt this before launching. its sad as I was excited for a mobile editor. too bad adobe, missed the mark on this one!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waste app of adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add titles"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Disappointed. The app won't open the video I am working on. Must uninstall and reinstall every couple days. Could really be a nice app if you fix that. Also offer better music too..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Deleted all my work randomly. I am distraught. Don't waste your time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very buggy app. Almost impossible to create project or add videos, in my case."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pass this one up. It's stuck on ""Fetching projects"" on launch, and I haven't even been able to create any projects yet! It's totally useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If the app worked I'm sure it would be great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Without a doubt the worst app Adobe has in its collection. They should be embarrassed that they charge money for thus garbage. Simple 3MB file skips constantly in the timeline so attempting a voiceover is comical. Exporting sometimes works, most often not. Horrible. Avoid at all cost and save from frustration. Adobe help center wasn't helpful. Said it must be my phone. Sad if a new Galaxy Fold 3 doesn't have enough RAM to support this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a joke, no graphics work, titles nothing. I would love to see adobe tank, for how much they charge for subscriptions their trash apps should work always but they don't. I use adobe and apple because I have to but they both compete for the companies I hate supporting the most. Thankfully after my renewal ends I will be at least moving on from adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hello, I download Adobe Premiere Rush App and try to use it but cannot because it's said Some Error Occurred. I use ZENFONE 8 Android so PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why am I paying for an app that is not working. I have videos that I'm unable to render. This is very frustrating and seriously considering canceling my subscription"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Couldn't import media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Can't select photos/videos from particular folder"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Faltu apna data"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I need chroma key or remove green screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Only 47% is downloading and after that it stopping.. not able to download..am trying from last 4 days.. kindly take quick action on this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Getting the dreaded 'Cannot open project' error message, meaning I can no longer access any videos. Only had this for two days and its stuffed already. Am deleting this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"1) Can not easily send feedback or give feesback. 2) When selecting photos and videos for a project you can not view per folder. 3) When you select a photos for the project it ads different photos to your project. That renders the project useless. Had high hopes for the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I thought this product was great 2 years ago but then they updated the app and now it's nothing but glitches and doesn't run as smoothly. What happened adobe??"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What was the use of putting my efforts into editing a video when the app cannot save it to the disk. Went through all steps of troubleshooting, it just refuses to save the rendered file."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't believe this is an Adobe product. The app crashes, the 4K video export takes super long and still turns out SO bad. Sometimes your video just doesnt load/open, sometimes the videos hang. Such poor quality. Shame on you guys for charging a bomb for subscription to such a low quality app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is laughable as someone who owns a samsung ultra 21 and who use to think Adobe was the king of software.. glitchy is an understatement"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely not"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App on both mobile and desktop is pathetic. It keeps crashing, graphics won't load and synchronization doesn't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As usual Adobe is simply the best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app this does work properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Pretty good for quick editing phone video. Crashes more often than I'd like and I can't delete old projects. Would be great if it could do CC too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"need tutorial on the buttons highlight it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage, I can't upload my own music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Graphics aren't even loading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It always says ""i'm low in space, and it won't open all projects properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"‰∏çÁü•ÈÅì‰∏∫Âï•Ôºå15MÁöÑËßÜÈ¢ëÔºå‰ªñ‰πüËÉΩÁªôÊàëÂç°Âú®21%ÔºåÁúüÁöÑÂæàÈÅóÊÜæ„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÂè¶‰∏ÄÊñπÈù¢ÔºåÁïåÈù¢ÂèàÂ§™‰∫≤Âàá‰∫Ü"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Honestly one of the worst editing apps for mobile I've used so far. Bugged and lacks features for syncing video and audio cues. I haven't had the app for more than a day and I already want to uninstall it. Please fix this app Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just bad. Pretty much worthless and video you can get it to make(if any) will be unusable. Extremely disappointing adobe let this out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its a really great and simple editing app with no watermarks is what I like the most, some bugs are there but overall really great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ONE OF THE WORST APPS IVE EVER SEEEEN"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is lagging. I added a music but you cant even hear it. I started a new project and it is not loading. A waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"They make you go through the internet to access internal storage. Absolutely stupid app development. go sit in the shame corner you damn pinecones. [Stuck in a load loop for a video stored in your own internal memory? Turn off all mobile data and wifi and you'll actually be given access to your own footage. Otherwise this apps going to cost you data and time getting stuck in constant feedback loops. Shame on the developers. For shame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lags a lot, full of glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Why remove auto doing video on the old apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I loke the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Avid adobe user and this is awful, always crashes, very slow, almost unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ridden with Bugs. I love Adobe products but this app is underdeveloped and plagued with bugs. Performance is slow. Text Graphics wouldn't load, so I had to uninstall/reinstall. Lost my local projects. Started working on a new one and none of my projects, including cloud synced, will load. Then my projects error out when opening and never got sync so I have to start all over. Having to uninstall/reinstall again and start over. Frustrating. As a paying subscriber, this is unacceptable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Video is not rendering. Then the app is stuck"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Recently it kept crash and have a yearly subscription ending in 2022 but cant export my video as app kept crashing and having errors. No customer service to contact too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's better to use VN"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It works on Android 10. But isn't picking up my portrait videos for some reason"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Apps keeps crashing while just in light workloads, I have a 8gb device with snapdragon 855+ running the latest December security patch and Android 11. IT SUCKS! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Literally unusable 80% of the time In that 20% where it is usable I use it because it doesn't have a watermark and that is the only reason."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just stopped working with update. Please fix. I was almost done with project. I can't open or create new file. üòï"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Plagued with faults and crashes. Freeware from less reputable companies work far better than this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Temperamental... this app doesn't work 50% of the time. Can't add text, can't load footage ..too many bugs to fix. Very disappointing. Don't waste your time with this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App continually crashed and has such limited features. Unbelievable that I pay for an Adobe subscription and this is the product I get. Updated this review to a 1 star as the app continues to be plagued with bugs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Avoid any monthly plan with them because they will charge you for future payments if you decide cancel it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Couldn't even process simple compilation of photos to make into a video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio crash, the app replacing my audio to ramdom weird audio, trash üëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It crushes to often..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is so laggy, wth happened? It wasn't like this before from what I remember. The amount of time I wasted waiting just for the assets to load could've been spent for 1 whole process from editing to posting on social media. So disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app really sucks, it crashes everytime I try to export my file üëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"In my opinion the besg editor for mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unavailable for Android tablets"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Other free apps are much better than this one. When it renders the video, it chops and looks bad."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Started out good, but now I have to Uninstall and install again for every project just to get it to load. And sometimes that doesn't even work üòï"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even add a reverse function...its been 3 years. Great job Adobe üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Sadly, the ""Add graphics"" button leads to a browser that's just spinning gray disks, so it's impossible to make anything much better than in Google's Photos, but maybe after some bug fixing, this might be really nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fire fire fire"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ruined 10 days of my life and a very important project this app is terrible don't even wast your time. And I'm not dumb this app is so glitchy its insane and it messed up all the audio and made my clips glitch when export to gallery im so angry I don't have the footage to remake it on a different app so sad so mad this app is garbage I can't say enough bad things right now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"You should be able to do anything with a video editor...but i canr even reverse edit a video with it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sadly this App has but all become too frustrating to use. What was once a user friendly editing App is no longer!!! Equally sad is that no one will read this and others reviews to provide feedback or a solution to all the software glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Won't sync to cloud for laptop use from phone, slow, glitchy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It looks good. But I'm trying to upgrade from the free version to the paid version via the app which has a 42% discount, and it automatically fails. I *think* it might be failing because I have my play store set to require me to authorize every purchase but it shouldn't be this difficult to pay for the app. üôÑ Maybe it's a sign to try something else? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app is OK but very cumbersome to use. Adding a sound or media file shows you the entire list of songs with no way to search leaving me to sift through thousands of sound files (not even in sorted order) to find the one I need. Now I just use CC on my main PC and don't even bother with Rush. I wonder if Rush is even programmed by Adobe? Seems like some 3rd party free knockoff."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"‡¶≠‡ßá‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶¨"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good ‚Å∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app screws up every video I make !!! It gets stuck on one frame and stays stuck on that one pic while the audio continues on every single time... If all you want is audio with a never changing picture then this app is for you, if you want actual video then run away as fast as you can and never look back !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I would always love to use Adobe's apps except for this one which can't login. To use it you must login but for me just keep sticking on start page with the notification ""can't login to cloud"". It's you who need to check it out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Potentially a great app, but it just load the resources (like those under graphivs) just half of the time and this makes working with it very frustrating. Will prolly not renew the subscription due to this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work at all import my video and all that plays is that audio. The video never plays no matter how long I let it load."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is the worst editing program I have seen in my life because when I click on the video that I want to do a montage, it shows me the video without a picture with sound only. Please solve this problem so that I can re-download it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Well found better üòå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't render videos properly on android. Sound bars aren't visible and frames are intermittent."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Problem in exporting.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage app. Inexplicably corrupts audio, time-navigation is unlike anything else, generally stupid."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I totally understand why the ratings are low. ‚Ä¢ Shuts down randomly. ‚Ä¢ Overlays won't load ‚Ä¢ Always downloading ""New"" Updates I used to love this app, so two stars üòîüòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'll give it another star when it finishes loading the graphics area, transitions texts lower thirds, overlays have been loading for the past week! There isn't much of a difference editing the video with rush or with a generic built in video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This sucks. I tried to record my voice over a video and it wouldn't stop beeping. I tried to restart the app but it didn't work still. Further more the app only takes like half your video because it laggs too much. They need to fix slot of things. There are so many better apps guys."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add a graphic, it keeps loading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Often have difficulty loading any of the graphics so I can't finish quick projects. I'm also now having difficulty trying to access my assets and saved intros in the creative cloud. Says that this pathway no longer exists. Kind of annoying."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"audio is lower pitched for some reason"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"First video was a 8 hour loop for (YT) content creation. Rendering stopped 10% through...when I went to restart it, the app froze."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hard to understand, didn't have what I was looking for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm starting to hate this app so much! It's is so glitchy and unreliable. You've lost a customer here!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Complete and utter garbage, I'll much sooner rotoscope a fast moving blurry objects on a 30 minute 500fps source video than work with this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The wors. It keeps crashing on every fevice. I deleted all data from them. Also deleted all the data from the cloud storage. All settings are good to go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Disappointed with the app. Adobe producing so much app now, so the quality is plugged down as the results. Dont recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"My video's dissapear. editing my videos disappear."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please optimize the app for the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not work at all... video does not show on editor after import. Just shows black screen with audio playing. Very disappointing. Used on note 20 ultra. Please fix this adobe! Other reviews also mostly poor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So you finally fixed it. Shame it's still broken. Won't let me save files anymore. Every time comes up with ""Error in Saving file to disk!"" regardless of disk space or app permissions. Would love to be able to actually use your software but it seems to never work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I came from iOS, I think this is maybe the best App for video editing on Android."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. A flagship phone that's now 2yr old. What a joke"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad app I recommend not using"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing, after spending hours editing a video I came back to fix a few things now it's giving me a error message. This sucks so bad. This is not the first time this happen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My videos won't render. They just hang, get to 6% and stop. What's the point if I can't export?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't let me import my photos and it lacks a lot I'm using my samsung s20+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just wanted to brighten a clip and I was able to mostly do that. The problem is that the app froze and was unresponsive. It was only a short 12 sec video. Not worth it to me so uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"In general this has a decent app for me as a beginner. But, won't it load graphics unless I uninstall and reinstall the app after each project. The dissolve feature between photos is wonky and jitters instead of dissolving smoothly. I would also like the audio library to have more light, energetic, fun music for product promotion. It gets the job done but it would be nice if it was less glitchy. Using the app on a Samsung S9."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is one of the worst on my Android S20. It USUALLY doesn't work...doesn't open up and doesn't render correctly. I have another app I pay $4.99 a year for that works PERFECTLY. I wish Adobe would invest money into their products!!!üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, after recent update app crushes frequently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is broken, graphics don't load, nothing loads, no sound or music either, Samsung note 20"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app just got f**** up not reliable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Another corporate greed victim. I was able to add your own audio and graphics but now its absolutely restricted to ONLY use the ones that come with the app unless you PAY. So I have to pay to use my own audio I already purchased or created? What a joke. Goodbye and don't bother"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worked well at first without any issues. Suddenly doesn't work, I've been trying to complete a video for 2 weeks now. Lost progress twice. Frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Great app... Currently the add graphic is not loading, tech guys please fix that. *Hopefully my 5 star rating doesn't deter them from reading my request. No need to give one star to get your attention üòá"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm an Adobe CC subscriber and was looking forward to upping my game on social media with Pr Rush but the program has failed to import my footage (despite waiting minutes each time... amounting to over an hour of waiting to import a few short short over all) or, if the footage uploads, the transitions and titles and overlays never show up. This has cost me time and added nothing. I really expected better from you, Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I can't save the videos with 60 fbs only 30 fbs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant even import my own media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Can't export. Just stuck at 30%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Paying for this app that can not use between devices even when I share to cloud üòë"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Total rip off, don't waste your time or money. Years ago adobe use to be good software but this app is the worst. Be ready to sign out and back in to get this piece of garbage to work. I won't be using/renewing my subscription to this app. Smoke signal are probably a more effective way to make a video and upload it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not loading some features on time (graphics) Controls aren't the best. Disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When you first open the app, you are hit with a notification that the app will send usage behavior to Adobe by default and you have to accept first and then go to setting to turn of if preferred. Bad practice. What about privacy by default. Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow, buggy, and doesn't work as of my most recent attempt to use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really slow, laggy and lack some of the most basic features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Lagging even on s20 ultra, quite buggy app for a proper video editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tried loading five videos - all of them couldn't be loaded. No further explanation offered. Useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is a joke!! I have to give this one star. This program is riddled with bugs and errors. It has never worked on my Samsung Galaxy Note10+ 256Gb with Android 11. Very frustrating. When it works its a fantastic editor but due to instability of the software I look elsewhere for my mobile editing such as VN witch works 100% of the times the timeline scrubs without fail. I'm paying so much for Adobe CC and thinking of leaving to use Davinci!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I want to add title. It's loading forever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it just like other but have only one problem change the delete split to first cause I have to scrool all the way to back and idk if there's a PIP option but if there not then please add it please all they way it easy and best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't eksport the project"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loading 24/7"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wasted my time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"cant see the video when played"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Alright app. The synch option is so bad that I'm scared to open any desktop item on mobile for fear I'll lose all my work. (Edit) I took my rating from a 3 to a one star. The app isn't working properly on mobile and every time I try to load graphics it's just a spinning circle."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is from Adobe? Really?!! Upon opening, it flips back & forth from portrait to landscape, back and forth and back and forth, without giving the operator a chance to do anything, including the ability to KILL IT!! Prime example of a developer developing a piece of software without even trying it - ADOBE (you listening to me?!) - YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Does not let you add your own sound"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It constantly freezes and crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app was easy to use and it worked just fine. Just recently the app seems to crash a lot and the graphics don't load. I want to add a title graphic to my video and I'm left on a loading page."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constant issues. Can't be my phone as it's a brand new s21+. Tried contacting support a month ago when I first had issues, and was never followed up on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing, my only concern is that you need to add more transitions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app keep not working with every one video I post on my youtube, Kulki9713. I even paid for a year of this, but I'm regreting my decision. In all honesty.üôÑüòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App doesn't let you edit the pixel size it's just fixed size options. App is also hard to use, most icons are not labeled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App doesn't work at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When it works it's great. But recently it has lost all text so I can't annotate the videos. Also the 4k rendering that I have paid for has stopped working and I can only render in 1080. Finally it keeps crashing when rendering."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't change text. After I add a graphic, there is no option to change the text. Please fix!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Easy app to use but garbage doesn't export 30 minute videos without the video crashing once fully exported"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Officially, the worst mobile app ever! It used to be good but now is practically unusable. You might end up committing seppuku if you try using it üòÅ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nul"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Quick and easy to use... this was from February 2021. As of November 2021 this app no longer works. Very frustrating. It just spins and then shuts down."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Kinemaster is best for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good after Update ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app I've ever used use VN Editor instead"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app dis work well but now its refusing to load up the titles when I click to add them. I pay a monthly subscription for this app and I'm not happy that it won't do a simple thing like add text anymore.. please can someone enlighten me as to why this is happening????"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App always crashes now! üòê"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Just tried it. First I had to change permissions on my A50. Then it is OK although it hangs when trying to add text. Just waiting and waiting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best mobile video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nonstop crashing on launch"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe is always reliable. The apps are easy to use and easy to follow. There's an app for a number of different things, and they're all good apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App stops working randomly and stops rendering my video randomly, very unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I built my first editing rig using a CRT tv, a vcr, a dvd player, and custom spliced RCA cables. I edited mini-dv on an Avid. I've had to use Windows Movie Maker. Adobe Rush is the WORST video editor I have ever experienced. Horrible UI, clunky controls, and good luck exporting!! Do not bother using this. It will fill you with rage. This is probably the worst product Adobe will ever create, it's that bad. Seriously. Do. Not. Use. This. App. If. You. Like. Your. Sanity."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This application is a new level of scam just downloaded it, and bannggg it asksfor an update."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why it can't support on my itel vision 2 pro Mobile Phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps Crashing I've been trying to create a video montage for days each time I attempt the video freezes and the app crashes. Loosing all progress. Fix this because what in the world"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it lags alot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad update? Swear I used to use fine now I can't do anything I fing wanna do on it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't play the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good app but now it wont open"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing on me when I try to open it so I can't even use it. Was good before but now I can't access my videos at all!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It can't even open a simple mp4 file correctly, 99% of the video content is missing in the editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It used to be so great. I spent around 1 hour working on a video, suddenly it said error. The clip doesn't open, it only shows the error message. What a waste of time and money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not only did a project I'd been working in for ages to sutepise a friend with refuse to render (I tried several quality types and at least 10 times) but now the app just quite when I try to open it. Really disappointing and would expect better from Adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I couldn't see any picture or effects while editing üò† could only hear audio"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Same problem with other users. It have so much lags when I play for previews."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"amazing app, best video editor only problem is it just doesn't work at all on like all android devices"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't render video render menu hangup after 50%"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The tips that pop up and WILL NOT GO AWAY are entirely not appreciated on tablet interfaces."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this is straight up dogshit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is not optimized at all to work on phone. I have a top tier phone s21ultra and i can preview a 480p video on the app in realtime. So bad app. I will stick with inshot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Barely works."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Multiple slow loading times, sometimes won't export a file over 90mb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a bad experience. The video doens't even render let alone edit it. I use a 6gb ram one plus flagship device yet the app is soo slow and unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Is the appt does have bugs? Because i keep on purchasing the premium version but it crash..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It is a good app, if u know how to use premier you won't have a problem with it. Just watch some quick YouTube videos on little things that are different but other than that good simple editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worked fairly well before but now the preview does not always play back to view changes and I find it very difficult to trim each video segment. Frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always stuck at ""fetching media"" screen. Unable to create a project at all. Totally useless in November 2021 on Poco F3"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Now what did you do? Now it won't even stay open. I've made some videos in the past but now graphics just sits there loading and nothing is happening. I might as well just edit on Premiere at this point which makes Rush useless. So much for professional grade editing from my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hangs at every opportunity, it's quite unstable and unusable. Samsung S21"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The preview keeps freezing, completely useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash, crash, crash every time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome product!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video quality converter like size high to low"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Oh my god......this app is a nightmare...guys i beg of u don't even consider downloading it....keeps on crashing,work destroyed, projects gone.....just lock me up in a room with the creator of this app....i will shove up a whole laptop inside him"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Love the idea, but poor performance makes this mobile app almost unusable. Took much longer than it should to complete a 2 minute project, and this is supposed to be the updated version on a big bad Pixel 6 Pro."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it. They just need an option to add subtitles."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App needs a serious fix. When I use it for some periods of time, it operates slowly and I was unable to press the play button to review an animation."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash-tastic. It's really quite impressive how much it actually crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps crushing. I can't do anything ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"üí©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not able to export video it gets stuck"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously long export time and the final exported video was a glitchy mess, wasted an hourish messing about. I then downloaded inshot and achieved what I tried here in two minutes flat without the video glitching and being a mess. Adobe sort it out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for montages"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loved the effects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible, slow, crasges... cant think of one good reason its worth keeping"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesnt load videos and will often discolour them"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this software, exactly what I needed üôå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This application is amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Some recent update made this app unusable on Android. Cannot play media after making an edit of any kind. It just freezes on a frame or is black."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It WAS good. Barely functional now. Audio plays but video is frozen so you have no idea what your edits look like."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App keeps freezing. It will play the video but the video is frozen so I just hear the sound. I have been working on a 12 second video for 2 days... I'm determined it will work... hahaha"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely worst after the update. I used it two years ago and it was great but now ? It's like a full money bag, even then the video has glitches after rendering, the sounds just get cut or don't connect, the files go missing etc. The list goes on. Didn't expect something like this from Adobe. ‚òπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"(Samsung s20 Ultra) Used to be great, but the recent update has meant everything is sluggish. Cutting a clip or applying a transition seems to make the video clip slow, everything takes forever to render and graphics & overlays don't even load anymore."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"buggy help pls :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good experience. Some time it s crashes, but its seems part of the tool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lag is brutal. Until that lagging issue is fixed, no good interface and usability can save this app. Fix the lag. Please."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Video cannot play once added"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It just crashes before opening. I have a Pixel phone, relatively new. I don't get why it doesn't work. I really hoped Adobe Rush would make my life easier."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I love the new feature where you have to close the app repeatedly just to get the clip to play! üëè Fantastic work you guys!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"edirt 2: wow you had to update the LANGUAGES rather than the PERFORMANCE! edit: garbage barely works how is this the original review: Works alright."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I tried, I really tried, especially cause I paid for the year. But after several short clips, I am giving up. I just didn't want to believe Adobe would release such a terrible app, tought it's my fault. Non-stop crashing, rendering for ages, texts look cheap, effects from the 90s and editing them is impossible on a screen... among so many other issues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Graphics and titles never work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Is kinda laggi"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too much bug. Fix it0"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't open, it crashes. I have s21 ultra. The phone shouldn't be the problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Is this app a joke? It simply does not work at all. Videos dont play or lose parts of the video. Photos disappear. Playback freezes the video and audio goes way out of sync. Forget adding music. The only thing that works is the colour grading but what use is that if you can not edit a 1 minute video? I use android s21 ultra. This app should be pulled by Adobe as an embarrassment. I know they have added it free to the adobe subscription and thats probably because its so bad. Look elsewhere"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worked well for the last year-ish but recent update made it unusable. Was a relatively easy way to cut together quick vids on my phone and do basic things like slow mo but now the video freezes constanly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not work on Samsung Galaxy s21 Ultra and from the looks of it never will"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable can't start any projects, just forever loads."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add any graphics as the app is not able to load the templets, the graphics tab just keeps trying to load and no graphics options actually show up."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Super hard to use on mobile. Choppy and elements hard to edit due to size."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"the app is buggy, preview freezes with black screen. unable to perform most basic function of video playback after importing. highly disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super quality videos export i like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst editing app.It Lags. When I try to upgrade to premium it starts crashing . The app is very slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The first time I used it there were no problems. Now all this app does is cause problems. It freezes and makes it impossible to actually edit your videos. In theory this app is great but it just doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Livid!! This app worked great for me in the beginning. Now it's constantly lagging, won't play the video, audio is always delayed etc. I immediately cancelled subscription and went to Filmora, best decision I've ever made!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't log in, it ask for my email then it just sent me a code to change my password didn't want to change my password just want to log in."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is Unusable for me. I was looking a quick way to edit my small projects that I film on my phone, and I cant get anything done. First off, it lags like crazy, timeline moves but the video is frozen. Everything thing else is clunky and slow. Workflow non existent. The premise is there great interface and seems promising, but an update would be greatly appreciated to boost performance. I do pay for it, so I would like to see updates for sure."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't think I've had to fight an app to make something as much as I need to with this one. It's almost impressive how often it crashes. Add a video? Crash. Delete something? Crash. Simply scrolling backwards? Crash. The only reason this gets an extra star right now is because when it works it's a very good easy to use video editing app. Key word is ""when it works"", right now you're better off finding some other app to edit stuff with. (Update: Can't even render now.....)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just awful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Seems like they were ""in a rush"" to get this to market. It's so picky about videos find type that it's compatible as to not really be that useful. Tried three different video sources. Codecs, whatever - it doesn't care for them, and I don't care for it. Uninstalling."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Suddenly extremely laggy after I've used the app for a very long time without any issues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I can't downloaded on my phone can any one knows what's going on?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not preview correctly. I have a note 20 ultra 5g and this should not have a problem previewing. Trimming does absolutely nothing and it reverts to the full length after. Rendering is quick and uneventful. Product is useless however without a preview."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"can't open graphics content... useless app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely disappointed with this app, slow loading, crashes, editing freezes & limited control. I used it on S9."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and glitches"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great editing options, but I have to uninstall and reinstall almost every time I use it. There won't be any available upgrades for the app, but it will just stop working until I do the reinstall. Super annoying."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seems perfect for me!! & I must suggest to use this instead of any other brand of app!! It's best over any other app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Made me pay and I can't even export my project. Customer service is horrible and not helpful so I'm stuck with a waste of money"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great way to edit across platforms then transfer to premiere or another program on main work (more capable) computer for completion. Sometimes my projects don't show up on 4G alone - like when I really wanted to show a colleague her completed video sequence in Rush in a public place we were meeting at and it failed to appear either on my phone or laptop. But now that I'm home it is there. It lags when I'm trying to playback to see and edit adobe's in program graphics. Opacity fades unavailable):"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After these many years it's still a glitchy POS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is atrocious. It doesn't have any feature which free video editor don't offer. Try adding a video it crashes. Try adding a graphic, you cannot do so, the loading cursor keeps rotating. In short a very bad app. I trusted Adobe for some quality, but this has shaken my trust in the company. They should take this off playstore and definitely not charge for it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glad to know I'm wasting my money on an app that just buffers the whole damn time!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I pay nearly $60 a month. I actively use photoshop, premier, illustrator, after effects, audition, etc. I am so incredibly happy with all these programs. So I see Adobe has a quick little mobile video editor so I can blast a quick cut and edit real fast and post it to social media.... but I can record a 30 second video, and it takes me nearly 3p MINUTES to edit because the app is slow, laggy, garbage....a 30 second video. Can't even play it back properly... do not recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to use it. Full of bugs. It's stopping every 2 sec."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keeps freezing! It use to work perfectly but having to constantly restart the app is taking my edit much longer."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very difficult to resize video. From the original 4 MB to 40 MB and I didnt change much. Too big to export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far it's great! Super easy, intuitive, fun"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"In The Begining I Was So Happy That Finally Have A Mobile Version Of Adobe Video Editing But Every Time I Am Facing Rendering Issues, Stopping At Some Percentage And Not Moving Forward. Pleasw Tell The Solution And Help The More Delighted Users Like Me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I definitely give it a 10 of 10:00 but had a great experience for sure it was good soup"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Only works sporadically on my Android. Fine on my wife's iPhone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty pointless. Very few to no capabilities as a video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm joining the chorus of editors and creators that day the app was great at first but now is simply disappointing. Each time Rush failed and I told myself I'd fix or finish my project when I could get to my laptop and use Premiere was maybe my sending a wrong message to it's developers that it was ok to let the app go limp. It's not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Well I'd have to say awesome app but.... what's the deal with the app freezing and not playing the video or lagging behind 14 seconds, the sound and video don't match up and workflow is disappointing when you can't even make a 1 min clip. Please fix. I have been am adobe customer for 10+ years and am paying for the Adobe suite... what's the deal with this?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Easy to use but GLITCHY!!! Lately I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to work,, and any time I use transitions,, it glitches in the render.. And the audio choices are TERRIBLE. 8 thousand hip hop choices, screaming hard rock, and no acoustic guitar, classical, or gentle sounds. Fix those and it'd be 5‚≠ê"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Eu ainda estou aprendendo a usar, mas estou amando!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editing app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Slow response on my phone (samsung S9) Compared to CapCut app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's so glitchy, slow to buffer, and honestly just not great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This has worked well for nearly 2 years for me. I have had a small break and a new phone and this is virtually unusable. EVERYTHING hangs. All the graphic have gone odd and I can't add any. Very disheartened as I pay for this service. I may switch editing software off the back of this, if they don't sort it quickly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I used to live this app, paid to upgrade and after the Android 12 update, I can't open any of my projects rendering the app useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe ruined this. I hate them for it. But why did I think Adobe would try and make something free and good? Horrible. Adobe is just straight up lazy now. I hate them. Can't do anything right."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app for video editing, graphic does not even load. I don't know why company like Adobe could not even make a decent app. More over in I'm a creative cloud subscriber Pathetic app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The videos come out laggy. So had to cancel my subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"In true Adobe fashion, this video editing program will frustrate you to no end, almost immediately. Went fine for 5 minutes. Suddenly for some reason the editor will not allow me to even move and place clips where I want them, and there seems to be no obvious explanation or solution. Try to load the title graphics? I think not, because Adobe is always a massive bloatware, that will NEVER load assets or playback your timeline in real time, no matter how powerful or capable your device is."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lagging like hell,can't get job done using this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not sure what happened but a lot of assets are missing. Graphics take a long time to load and video freezes sometimes when trying to preview it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't match the versatility and responsiveness of the kinemaster I've tried. I feel cornered in expressing what I want in my video edits."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app used to work flawlessly, but now it's very slow, Miranda's never finish I used to have it on my pixel 3 and it worked fine and then I thought maybe my phone was dying, that wasn't the case because now I have the pixel 6 pro and it's still not working there needs to be an update for this fix it's very laggy, you can't scrub through the video, and renders never finish it either stops at 45%, and it's only on Android that this happens on my iPad it works fine but not pixel 6"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The playback lags so much it isnt even moving, other video editing apps performs a lot better, fix your app adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Preview doesn't work on videos for s10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used to love it, now it crashes every time I attempt and export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I wish this video editor worked!?!?!? The features and way of editing on this app is so nice/convenient but it freezes every 2 seconds on my Galaxy Note 10+ I'm a nerd with tech, made sure to clear ram and all running apps before editing... still freezes through playback constantly. I thought Adobe was supposed to be THE SHIET. not shiet lol"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"New review here: i geuss adobe has decided to forget about us Android users. The name should be Adobe Premier Crash. Old review here: Missing a few features...like time reverse but overall amazing! I have the creative cloud subscription and working with this app and the cloud is LIMITLESS with what you can do on your phone tablet and desktop. Also comes with a decent stock library of sounds and graphics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't load well and crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app worked amazing at first, easy to use interface for simple video production. After I purchased the upgrade, it has become impossible. Constantly freezing and taking a long time to open. I've tried everything from clearing data on my phone to deleting and redownloading. What should be a 10 minute editing process has turned into hours just waiting for it to unfreeze. After this project I will likely try and get a refund and find another app to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Still no update and I'm unable to export my projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really liked it, simple, useful and free!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Text or graphics tab not loading. Am facing issues during saving the file which is taking long time and sometimes file doesn't get saved"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Way to make an awful product can't even add a soundtrack"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't do anything without it crashing lol"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please check ur bug of this apk .apk are not supporting and working in vivo y15"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"After the update my apps Graphic section just doesn't load. It just shows the black screen. Because of which I can't use the feature at all. How can I fix it someone pls help. In the meantime, pls don't have auto update on"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't access at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Though the color correction and grading is better than KineMaster, this app is full of bugs and glitches. Also and most importantly to me, it does not allow customization of exported FPS such as 24fps. Only 60 and 30 fps. Which sucks for the ""industry standard"". Will be sticking with KineMaster for now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cannot open projects on my phone, even if they were started there. I want to like the app, but I can't when it doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The very best app to edit videos.. I am glad that i had found it‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not ready for prime time üò™"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I want my money back this is a complete scam doesn't even work properly on my phone and my phone is is flagship too many glitches and errors I can't even cut properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and fast, great for Tik Tok/Reels. 10/10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Barely rendered a 3 second video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Has some glitches, but either than that, easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsom ‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ITS TRASH ITS ALWAYS LAG I HAVE 5GB LEFT BUT IT SAYS ""clear some storage"" FIX IT"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is awful! Please avoid it. I spent hours editing my video only for it to upload choppy, have horrible sound, and when I reopened my app all of my content was gone. So disappointing. I'm passed especially since I paid $35 for this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a pretty good editing software particularly on phones.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is is so much better on iOS. I import videos from my files and the screen is black and the audio is slowed down. It so slow and buggy on android, its such a shame."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's nice and really helpfull but it is a litle bit slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good for when you don't want to actually open premiere"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Been promised for Samsung users free content, but all premium are cost. Liars."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't play my video and won't export it! Completely useless!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's good but sometimes I do face problems while editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not showing videos in edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Big respect üôè but it's so slooooooowwwwww"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Downgrading my rating from. 5 to 2 stars. I continously have to reopen the app because it froze or closed on me. This app seems to have gotten worse with each new update. I pay a lot of money to have Adobe Creative Cloud and when I cannot get an app that is part of this service to work consistently it is nerve wracking. I've lost countless hours editing video because the mobile app is so buggy. I'm sick and tired of this and starting to look for alternative applications."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So difficult to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why do all of the Adobe apps suck. Their software on the computer are all great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it just can't afford it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My experience has been a nightmare, I bought the annual pack and the first problem I noticed is that projects don't get deleted or renamed, for the first few days you can use the graphics but then it doesn't load, a lot of reviewers on youtube were saying it's better than kinemaster and the best editing app for phones, I thought so many can't be wrong so I bought it but now I am left with nothing but regrets &' frustration!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable. For a company like adobe this is comedically bad. Update app is un-usable on new Samsung devices. Terrible app. Look into other video editing apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It has too many bugs, had to uninstall and reinstall twice. It is not so easy to move items around and feels lacking or tools to customize your work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So not ready for prime time! Creating titles is an exercise in frustration. Add a title, yet to add text. The keyboard doesn't reliably pop up! If it does, good luck trying to edit the text. The app is just a mess. Uninstalling it after 20 minutes trying to get some simple tasks done - tasks completed in a couple of clicks in other editors."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The video clips stop playing once I start editing. A can't scan the video clips because it freezes on the first frame."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app, but experiencing lots of issues which make it frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Earlier its was perfectly working, but now preview is loading loading loading... not at all able to work in it. Pls fix.!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A great app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Needs more features I got more in my regular gallery"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is terrible, its useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The latest update makes this virtually unusable for even the smallest projects. Unless it's fixed I will have to cancel subscription and find a better alternative."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally easy to use for a mobile editor! Great for quick simple projects, I'll keep working with it and see how creative it can be. The music choices and preset transitions are also nice. Right now I'm not sure what I don't know vs what I can't do but I'll update as I figure it out!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Same problem everyone else is having. Graphics aren't loading, buggy start up, glitched projects. What an absolute mess and a shame, considering this was my go to editor. You should be refunding the people who actually paid for premium too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"My experience was very bad... Because i want to upgrade rush in app settings... When i try to upgrade and purchase annual subcription the app is closing again and again"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have used this app on my phone and PC. The first few times it worked great. After I paid for the subscription, the app started not saving and the PC showed that the program was not responding. Lost a lot of work due to nothing backing up correctly. Waste of time, money, and an overall disappointment."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Love the cloud and working on multiple devices!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely expensive and hardly ever working. Im looking for other alternatives. Now won't function at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just an awful experience, unintuitive interface. Difficult to use tools."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Now that they have this working for the S21 Ultra, video editing has been a breeze to create!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Since recent update i can't do anything!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For a app that costs so much you would think it would work. They need to fix everything so it works before they have the cheek to charge for it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app while part of Adobe allows you to edit videos from your phone and upload to different platforms is absolutely not worth the time anymore. Whatever new updates have happened make videos lag to where I'm unable to edit. I'm not able to see anything but a black screen and audio because it cannot handle the videos. The app also randomly shuts down."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keep crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app has some major audio issues. It's impossible to synchronize audio with video because it bugs up very badly in the studio. Video clips will shorten or lengthen which throws off the music, and theres no way to fix it, so you dont know what you'll get until you publish the video, and it's always wrong (delayed by half a second to a full second)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Add Target Video/Selective/specific object Colour Change.... Like Adobe Premier Pro.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely lagging can't edit anything. I was looking for and alternative to Imovie"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app has been really helpful but recently it's been doing nothing but freeze when I try to play parts of a video, and I am taking way longer than I should be to just edit a simple video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I purchase the full year and the program doesn't work. I canceled but still charged for the year. Please can you refund this charge as I am not getting what I paid for"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Updating my review: this app is horrible. From a company that is supposed to be an ""industry standard"", they can't get the most basic version of their full software to work. I'm done putting in support tickets. Don't with constant app crashes, stutters, audio issues, freezing, etc. You name it, it has happened. Avoid this app at all cost, work on your projects on a basic computer with HitFilm or DaVinci and save yourself the headaches. I'd give this 0 stars if I could."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Chilling and learning."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was a beta tester for awhile now. By and large, the bulk of my editing seems very processor intensive and the preview ALMOST never seems able to keep up. To compare, YouCut video editor runs circles around Adobe Rush. There are only a few areas where Rush isn't clearly beat by this other app. I'm a CC subscriber and I expected MUCH more. Just left beta because it's no longer worth my time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Since the last 2 updates, the app is glitching CONSTANTLY! I cannot do a large part of my actual job because of it!! I do a lot of social media montages and editing on the go with a phone is very handy. This just made my job much less streamlined."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is giving the glitch after rendering the video. It just ruen the whole edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'm conflicted. I love having a video editor on my phone that is pretty capable and easy to use with just my fingers and gestures. But, this app can run slow, and it exports really REALLY slowly. I don't know if Adobe is committed to this app in the long run but it is useful and it has potential. I just wish it functioned properly. Competitors like Canva are in it to give them a run for their money for the average content creator."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I paid good money for whole cc and the adobe app selection is trash. The cherry on top is the few apps I can get never functioning correctly. Rush crashes constantly. I used to be able to use it a little bit but now it just seems not to function at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Purchased the annual membership a few months back. Worked fine until recently. Now I can't see the ""Graphics"" and I need those to create my videos. Very frustrating! Please fix this, as many of us paid you for the use of your app and can't even use a basic feature like graphics. Also, when I export the videos, if they are longer than about 3-4 mins, they ALWAYS glitch and are choppy when viewing. I have to save videos in 3 min increments and then combine them in a whole other app. Inconvenient!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing, wont render a 45 second clip, I've tried everything at this point. FIX YALL APP MAN"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Just utterly slow and buggy, how ironic for it's name."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst editing app i ever used i pay 16 pounds a month for Adobe and sometimes I like to edit on the go i feel cheated by Adobe please can you tell us what's going on???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience. Stops in rendering page almost everytime. Today i just add two photos & a background song. It took 30 mins and finally got stuck at 54%. I definitely not recommended using this app. Waste of you efforts. Trust me üò†"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I use this almost daily. The best app by far for Android. The best part is it converts to h264. *update- this app has became unusable. Please fix the crashing. It crashes after every edit, crashed even after I gave up and tried to render anyway. Please fix. I need this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adobe since Photoshop 1 and premiere since the start and I gotta say this has potential but has software and UI issues. Issue # 1: when selecting a thumbnail the photos flashed on and off the screen fast. The rest of the UI was solid. But when trying to select a thumbnail. The thumbnails of my photos flashed on and off. S21 ultra 5g latest updates. Issue 2. Changing text on a intro title just wasn't super intuitive. Wasn't clear to click text in vid to change. Help menu AI to recommend topics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can only hear the audio, video playback is showing black screen only. Please fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freezes, crashes, doesn't export properly... Don't waste your money... OnePlus 7 Pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not sure if it's premiere on Android sucks, or simply Exynos 2100 chipset sucks. It has been a pain to scrub through footage and stutters SUPER badly (1 frame per 5 secs or more?) Incredibly unpleasant and unable to preview footage before rendering. Using it on S20+ Exynos 990 was horrible. Now, even experiencing on S21U Exynos 2100, it's equally bad. Smh."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow and hard to navigate Images that I chose for the video disappeared and could not edit titles???? Shocking considering I have always chose Adobe over everything else üòµ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"For paid app I expected it to have the ability to reverse a clip. In addition to this is not very stable. But when it works it's easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My advice: buy the inshot app! Finally had enough after a year of dealing with endless desasters and a total clueless support, who basically has nothing to offer other then: ""please restart your phone, log in again, reinstall the app, please wait for the next update"" (seriously! I payed for a functioning app, i have no time to wait till you guys feel like fixing this long known mess finally!) Inshot does it fast, smooth without problems, should have moved on long time ago!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't allow title slides, now just crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I purchased an annual subscription and my rush does not work at all. Some projects just won't open. When I try to add graphics it's just showing loading, but never actually finishes this load... Because of such problems my work struggles. Please if there any way you can fix it. Do it ASAP! Or give me a refund on my account. Even my account in the app isn't opening. The app says it's a problem with loading."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is garbage, literal garbage, like i put a video in and only the audio works, and sometimes it just stops working Also it is very slow It actually has a lot of potential because it has many great tools in it but right now it is very glitchy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As a previous user of Adobe Premiere, I found this logical to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Jittery playback, even on export. Motion effect doesn't work on some sources. Video doesn't snap when resizing, no key framing motion."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"T√° simplesmente IMPOSS√çVEL editar um v√≠deo em 4K, fica travado em um frame com o √°udio rodando, o app fecha, o √°udio fica rob√≥tico... p√©ssimo. T√¥ cancelando o plano Premium, n√£o funciona."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't seem to work at all. Always crashes. Surely this isn't right for an Adobe product?!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Usually is great for me but lately I've been having pro lems with it pulling back up projects I've started. I will either get a continuing spinning wheel, or ""could not open your project, please try again. I've had to rebuild a project 3 tines now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disgusting app. I have never felt so frustrated while editing but this app compelled me to write this. Trust me I have used a lot of editing softwares but this is a complete pain in the nerves. Take my words, it's not worth it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"MUHAMMAD MUNZIR BIN AB SAMAD has not been delivered to the address of the sender and is not the intended recipient you must not use or disclose the contents to anyone otherwise please let me know if there is anything else I need to do to help you with the application and I hope you can help me with the application and I hope you can help me with the application and I hope you can help me with the application and I hope you can help me with the application and I hope you can help me with the"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's not bad overall, but there are just too many limitations and features that do not make this all too worth it. I am aware that you have to pay to have more features, but having more without paying would be really cool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. But sometime it very lag when playing the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes all the time. Customer service is a difficult thing to navigate through"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app always stuck. Shame to such a great company. When I start render video it stuck on 16%. This app don't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported projects freezing. Can someone fix this?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app needs ALOT of fixing to do I'm not sure if it just doesn't support the Samsung S20 FE but it lags way too much, it bugs out alot. Please try and fix this as soon as possible I'm not trying to bash this app because it's a great idea but you spend more time struggling with it then actually putting the video together."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have never seen such a high rated app have as many issues as Adobe rush does. Constant crashes, freezing videos, and more lag than windows 95. Complete trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm not a person who complains about every minor detail so I'm writing this with hopes that it will be fixed. I've paid for pro version for the year. 1) My videos are currently not loading from the app so I have no access to them from my phone. 2) Videos sometimes freeze while I'm editing which makes it difficult for projects. 3) If you delete all the video/photo items from the first line the entire project is deleted along with it (you can hit the undo button to fix this, still inconvenient.)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the app for YouTube work, if you use a phone for footage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I used to SWEAR by this app, but was there a new upgrade or something?? Pulling an all-nighter to complete a last minute project, and after getting all the media content in the sequence and edited to my liking, none of the graphics menus are loading. I tried to sign on using my PC thinking maybe the issue was with my phone, but the project won't even sync to the cloud. I'm sooo close to being done, but despite several restarts and sign outs, I can't get the app to work or sync. :-("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whatever you have just done to the app has broken it. My projects are freezing and crashing to the point I can't get one done. Time to cancel premium."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If i cant add audio wuat use does this have"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The video is always frozen on one frame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update... still slow. Poor output video quality. Slow and Glitchy....I keep using it because it has a lot of easy to use features. But its slow and it stalls (freezes) multiple times during projects. Its like running dial-up internet on a 1k$ pc. I like their generic music library, speed up option, cut and change, and sizing features. It also allows for voice-over."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and freezing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Update: After using this app, there is one annoyance that makes it unusable sometimes. There is a video glitch when you export the video. It ruins the edit and I hope there is a patch that can be done to fix this. Original: First time editing a full update Vlog on it. I love the templates and effects available to me. I just wish I had a little more control over the transitions, so it won't be forced on the beginning and end of the clip. Other than that, I've loved the ease of use so far!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lousy app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Titles and graphics won't load off wifi. Items refuse to render."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Does not oporate seemless at all real choppy and takes for ever to actually make a video due to the apps inefficiency"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work anymore"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great App. Gets a little buggy when projects get big, but still very powerful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Enough"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing and is slow. I have just started using this on my PC and was hoping for something similar on my phone but that is not the case."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App is easy to use but it crashes constantly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"**** you application worsted app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Titles not working anymore"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sound doesn't sync to the video properly. You just have to guess where the beat is because the sound and the audio file in the track don't match up"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly Crashes. Paid for subscription and everytime I use the app it freezes and crashing. Now the most recent update I can't even open my last project after doing hours of work on it. Poor product wish I could get my money back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app is so buggy and slow even on a Snapdragon 888"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everytime I watch a whole video In this program and then replay, it just shows up as a black screen. I can't even upload 27 seconds worth of footage, un freaking believable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Finally out on the S21. I hope the jerky clips and export problems go away now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Has failed me yet thanks adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Enjoy using the app. Easy to make adjustments to projects on the fly, or throw together a quick edit while on the move. I do however have a few issues. First off, I have an active subscription, but it won't let me use premium functions, and it won't let me restore the purchase either. Secondly the app crashes a bit too frequently. Notably every time I try to restore my premium purchase etc. Please fix this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Is a good editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Preview not working properly Many bugs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"contently crashes >:("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"No landscape editing support."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After spending xx hours on 3 nice project the app updated in the background and ALL WORK IS GONE... This is the most frustrating experience I unfortunately ever experienced"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Non working on brand new Droid with PS installed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, easy to use app :D"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keep crashing when I edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps Crashing and All of the sudden rendering takes few days. Before it was normal and great app. I hope soon developers fix this issue..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crying out for stabilisation. Won't use it until that's added"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App will not install for me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"juss"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As someone who actively uses premiere pro on pc, this doesn't match it. Because it's not supposed to! It's a simple watered down video editor that's super easy to use when making small edits to videos you make on your phone. The ui is really simple to navigate and it's really easy to find everything! (Also great for editing tiktoks if thats what you're into lol)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super app I love lot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lets use gifs great for producers"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Arabic Language is not supported. Please fixed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Real waste of money. On the mobile app the exported video file quality is very low. No use of it. And the app project has stopped syncing with desktop. Desktop app can't recognize me as paid user. Moreover, now I am not able to export any project from the mobile app at all. Tried thrice, failed every time... I guess I may have to uninstall and reinstall. But what a piece of junk! Bad name to Adobe for this ..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why can't they get this to work with tablets? Galaxy s7 plus no compatibility. Considering what they charge for this it should be compatible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Failed to export due to low storage space even though there was enough to render. Still a great app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for video editing like pc editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is android premier pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"OMG Awesome App I'm also a Video editor..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Requires a account so is absolutely useless. Uninstalled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Awesome app... But still have a lot of bugs need to fix... Please keep working on it as I like this app too much in editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't bother using this piece of trash. Just use anything else other than Premier rush cause it sucks!!! It always crashes. I even got a video of it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app keeps crashing on me once I open it !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like Adobe Video Edit ... Easy and Smooth"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was great but now it doesn't want to stay open."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good application for edit videos in mobile.. But, it need to improve bit to make easy and user friendly.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The world best premium cross platform video editing app for all devices"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Three times I've tried to finish editing of a video. Three times it lost all my work due to glitches. It looks like the app's RAM management is not well tested."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ui is not intuitive at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Currently broken on Galaxy s10. Crashes on startup. Working fine on my iPhone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"How can I edit a video without watched... There is nothing..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have used this app. I am a YouTuber. But it was totally disappointing from Adobe. As *Adobe* I expected much better. Very heavy app like lagging in my upper mid range processor which should not lag. And it has less function than inshot which is smaller lighter and faster. And if you want transitions which is not satisfactory in inshot ... You can also use VLLO but don't use it. It's worst of Adobe. It's also very hard to use for beginners."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice clean app for instant video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps on crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great app, but I have to keep clearing cache/data and force-stopping it because it keeps crashing when I haven't opened it for more than a day. So annoying!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crash, crash, crash. I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Repeatedly crashes...utterly useless until they fix that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not Useful . Worst app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For starters its very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"There is no reverse, there is no way to cut clip by dragging video. But style is dope"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible app would give it negative starts if possible. Waste of time and space; it glitches so you have to close and open it constantly, the audio once you edit it will go out if sync but once you reload it, it is fine and if you've changed it then that's more work, it freezes constantly so again you have to open and close it. PC editing is much better and I'm sure there's better mobile editing apps as well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the app, not really had any issues. Just wondering when it will be available on the s21plus and s7plus tablet?? Hard finding a multi track editor app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is actually one of the best applications that I have ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't even use the app. I open it and it crashes. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è No matter how many times I install and uninstall. I used it before and never had these issues and it was a pretty decent app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"hi team, everything is perfect no doubt ...but it's crashing again and again please do something."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing, after one video render. Work around is to uninstall and download each time..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Again, my edited videos would not render. I have been using Rush since 2020. Lately it has been refusing to render. What gives?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice and easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The rendering of minute long videos will take mutiple lifetimes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every time I want to open it I have to reinstall it. The desktop version just continually crashes and the mobile app closes itself every time. Very disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"was loving it tell all of a sudden it just keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience rendering time is taking too much long, rendered quality is too poor ,the rendered video have some issue it is getting stuck for a second and playing again and again"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's good!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can only use it after log in."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I am the Walker of sheeps, the guide of life, the helper of the dead."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If this app wouldn't have so many super annoying bugs, it would be awsome. It is soo frustrating when you try to get a video for youtube done and the app freezes and won't let you export. All the hard work for nothing! It happened to me now 5 times. Also some songs get a copyright claim on youtube even though adobe claims the music is all copyright free. Another bug doesn't let me play the video for all the sudden in the middle of editing. Where is the update to fix all of that? I am waiting..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes, won't stay open."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So, I've been paying for Adobe every year since 2015 and it'd be nice to get the service. This app is broken. It crashes upon start/loading media. This has been happening for months. No updates fix it. Samsung galaxy s10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Everything works and I was only looking for an app that would give me more control of my camera but it has some very nice editing options I'm gonna use to make a rough edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps closing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It works but doesn't allow me to pinpoint files it didn't auto detect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Love the app but suddenly stopped working completely on both my and my wife's phones. We've uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. Not sure what happened but 1 star until fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App force closes after opening. Worked for about 5 minutes and now does not run at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not as steep of a learning curve as it's PC big brother, never had an issue with quality of exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm updating my review. Previously I had issues finding where the video had been saved. They've done some improvements. Also, I like the new yellow pop up box when you click on the clip, with cut and delete options. It would be nice to have blending options though. However I am happy with it. Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A great app for editing video on my phone (a Samsung S8) and creating content for uploading direct to social."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Instability x 1000. So, I have been dealing with the same issue regardless of how many updates come out. I do a project, it crashes, then when reopening it.. it crashes and I can't use the app. So, I have to uninstall (this is after attempting to disable, then re-enable.. etc.) And then reinstall it. Only sometimes I have to repeat until it works. For the amount I pay for the subscription and the amount of money they get from ppl.. these apps should be flawless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best video editing app, it has all the features for video editing...üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loving It"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So basicly if you don't subscribe (around USD40 in my country), you just get a useless video editing app with 2-4 basic features any other app can provide. Only subscribers get the full features. The features are nice. But normal people use video editor once a month. Also PC video editors just works better. I mean, if you have to pay, then why waste money on ""just okay"" app anyway, right?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good concept and UI, but sadly the technical implementation is rather lacking. Sometimes clips won't load at all, videos recorded within the App are fairly pixelated, provided they are being captured in the first place (""could not import media"" at least half of the time, leading to everything you recorded being lost). There is no way to manually save, other than to close and reopen the project, meaning you'll lose your progress if the app crashes (which it also does occasionally)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used once then could not use it again, the app won't stay open. Closes after about 3 seconds. I have a new install."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not support Mi note 10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This really sucks as a video editor on a cell phone. There are way better options that don't require you to sign in."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly freezes. Sometimes won't do playback at all, the wave forms on the audio desyncs from what the audio is actually doing making it hard to match cuts to the beat of the music. Just to edit one 59s video I have had to open and close the app over 15 times to sort out minor glitches. Not at all an enjoyable experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app keeps crashing. The only solution is a complete reinstallation. Almost unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why is it still not available on Samsung S21 Ultra, I've waited since it came out 6 months ago. I had it on my previous Samsung, I don't understand why it's not updated yet. When will you finally release it?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Wish they made canceling as easy as they make subscribing..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes on brand new Pixel 5. Haven't been able to use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable on Galaxy Z Fold 3. Crashes constantly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I've used this on iOS and it is great. For some reason, the play store lists it as incompatible with the Pixel 4a (5G) though. What's the deal Adobe?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best video editor app for Android.üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Thus far I'm satisfied. For anyone not familiar with Adobe CC Premiere Pro, you'll probably enjoy the simplicity. For anyone that is experienced with ACCPP, this does well for a mobile phone app and you'll like the similar layout. But some abilities that you like with the desktop version will be missing. Best mobile app I've used by far."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm a content creator and I must say, it's the best and most convenient on video editing apps for phone, and I'm speaking judgment base on maybe 10% usage on the app. So excited into digging up more!!."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Has opacities on multiple video channels. Exactly what I wanted. Simple, easy for premier users x"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Is there a minimum requirements for smartphone to use this app? Coz in my phone the app often crash and when the rendering process seems doesn't working well because some audio or video are lagging, choppy or I dont know what should I say it in english."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"My go to editor on the go!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"If u can add a video to show us, to enjoy all the capacity of the app, it will be good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Basic and easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So as a truck driver that also does video work I was hoping for a stand alone mobile video editing app. Adobe Rush has failed. It only works if I'm on wifi, any other time it crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Too late to rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"No pan and zoom.. Its a simple thing adobe is not really brothered to add!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editing videos with this app is a nightmare. It constantly crashes, does not playback or crashes while rendering. Ended up using another app with more color correction features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for what I need making quick YouTube, TikTok, and reel videos. Also the Juno between desktop and mobile is a big perk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worked for a couple videos now every videos playback is offset and the pitch of all the voices are super low. Cant fix it by changing any effects and its only Adobe Rush. Could be a good app but functionally useless aside from reframing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app But it would have been nicer to have a explanatory video which tells us about the entire app. Its features, and where is it located would have been nicer. One more thing, my redmi note 10 is only supporting this app but not my A71! It says ""Your device isn't compatible with this device"" What is the problem?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Can't render. Please fix this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trouble with the basic frame rate.. the video is lagging severely even while editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I had huge expectations when i downloaded the app... But im disappointed to see that it doesn't work on my OnePlus 7...it takes ages for videos to load... And they remain frozen during playback... I hope you guys fix it soon..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Got stuck while rendering. Tried multiple times and it always stops at 46%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not very intuitive. I use premiere pro every day for my work and played around with a few other video editing apps for mobile. This is by far the worst."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One word. Awesome."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It shutdown all the time as soon as you open the app. Sucks!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A friendly interface, and a good tool to do something quick"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Glitches after 2 or 3 changes. Response to command is slow and unwanted links to layers occurs when creating more than one row of imported items."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hanging every minute"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to make videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Cannot render. Stalls at 39%. Would be great otherwise."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing. Funnily enough if I switch WIFI OFF it doesnt crash. It must be somthing to do with synchronisation."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When you export your video it always downgrade the quality of the video. So is a total bs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add title"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use,user friendly interface,no lags, quick export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best video editing apps I've used. It would be nice to have an option to fade audio in and out. But besides that it's perfect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Except for a few abrupt restarts this app is great!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering takes lots of time..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It produced distorted videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerfull video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Mostly ok and easy enough to learn quickly however connectingy phone and laptop was complicated and now I'm being asked to pay seperately for both apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Honestamente si esperaba m√°s para ser de pago."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelent..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"While the app itself is pretty good, lack of support for tablets or chromebooks is just ridiculous. I can somehow understand the chjromebook thing, but tablet? ugh... will be looking for an alternative"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing as soon as it opens. Not useable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App needs a lot of improvement. Pls improve it, i love LR and my expectations for this one is destroyed."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App constantly shuts down. Right in the middle of editing or when rendering it says something went wrong and you have to restart rendering. After about 10 trys it might finish. I have been on the fence about buying the premiere version but I will hold off until they fix the crash issue. Update. Still have"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes alllllll the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please give all Lumafusion and Node Video features in AP Rush and I will give 5 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is, so far, the best video editing app I have found! Not only if it extremely user friendly and easy to use, but it has professional editing abilities! It's not like some of the other apps that you just slap a filter over your footage, or you just click a button and it does what it effects it thinks you should do! You can literally do all kinds of awesome stuff with it! Highly recommend this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I wish there were more options for colour and effects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So I can't download this on my large Samsung 7 tablet(came out 2020) But I could download it on my tiny Samsung 9 phone(came out 2018)? I'd rather have a larger area to edit videos. And the fact the tablet is newer you'd think it it would run it But ok adobe. Idk how it works yet. But right off the bat I'm disappointed in that fact."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot even use the app due to it malfunctioning, closing and only working for 5 seconds at a time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes every time I open it on my mobile while the desktop version is fine."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wy≈ÇƒÖcza siƒô sama."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It was working quite well before but starting sometime after the last update, on startup it now just freezes and crashes I really wish this worked it was fun to edit videos with."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use the Adobe aps.as a media student and I am learning a lot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Been using this editor. Underated but actually very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Export took 5 days for 13 sec 1080p 30fps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I had to restart the app a couple times though out my project and the capabilities are limited especially if your used to the full premiere pro version. But it gets the job done for a quick edit on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Is this app has watermark?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super user-friendly. Now newbie like myself can edit videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed; what supposed to be a high quality app by Adobe, end up being a really frustrating experience. The app keep crashing as soon as I open it. I read other reviews and it seems that it's a very common problem.üëéüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I don't know why but I just can't download it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app was very"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update 6/1/2021: crashing every time I open it within seconds. Can't use the app at all. When it worked... Easy to use, renders shorts quickly via mobile phone, and can post easily to social media. Another update 9/6/2021: still crashes moments after opening. Can't use at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"But transection not more"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The audio from music and videos cuts off at random, and it repeats a segment of audio (music) for a second. It's really irritating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First time user, the interface is extremely user friendly, if you can drag and drop then you can use the app. 5 star"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Please make this app accessable to all devices.. The rendering happens fast, but I am not able to edit videos quickly even with good specifications.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's good..."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This App would be the best if it worked for my Galaxy note ultra 20. Every time I start getting into a project the App freezes then crashes. After trying to re open it crashes. I Tried force quitting and clearing cache, but still crashed. I Uninstalled / re-installed and restarted my device. Lost all projects and still crashed. Hours of creativity gone. I spent 2 hours with adobe customer service, STILL CRASHES. Now I'm frustrated. I hope this helps someone not lose their mind."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cada vez que quiero editar un video debo reinstalar la app... se vuelve molesto y no es justo porque eso posiciona la app en las descargar principales cuando en realidad es porque la app s√≥lo funciona una vez."

Please fix as soon as possible. üôèüíô (Samsung S20 5G)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy video editing for Android by Adobe!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"At the point of me writing this i have nothing to say besides that adobe needs to fix there app it is buggy and i will agree with a lot of people in saying it's missing alot of key features. I think in my opinion that at the least they need to release an update for it. And dont get me started on the app for pc or mac you have to pay for it. Which in my case i would be better off to buy the bundle of adobe photoshop and adobe pro. I now realized that i should have looked at the reviews first."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I realy love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Upgraded to paid plan in my android Samsung Galaxy Note9 around 3 days ago..now the app suddenly crash upon every launching..feels like been cheated by adobe..seriously i need to edit lots of videos but now i cant beacause of this problem. I'm so frustrated."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cant wait to experience more edits on the app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"No ability to compress, can't change frame rate, can't change bitrate... so I've got an 80 MB mobile screen recording that's just 1 minute long I can easily get it down to 3mb / 5mb compressed in the desktop version of Premiere... but Rush forces me to use ""absurd"" high quality settings that make the video unnecessarily large for mobile devices... The #1 most important thing on a mobile device would be compressing..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's alright. The computer version for Rush and Premiere Pro are absolutely horrible though. Rush works well for mobile phones, however it always screws up my audio so I just had to uninstall it. I have a lot of issues with Adobe's video editing software, so I don't know. May be different for other people though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it, and its so easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is a legitimately good, basic video editor. I don't know why it has any negative reviews (??) You can even export in 1080p. Maybe even more I haven't tried yet. What more do you guys want"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad app dont install and video slow loading and hanged mobile phone"

Talk of text titles, Transitions, audio clips, trim split crop tilt rotate even color grade videos. It does it all. You just need to know it and after couple of edits, workflow is like a breeze. Please fix the slow rendering and add a few more features like reverse a video, add key frames, and it will be just perfect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keeps closing on me. It won't even let me start a project. All it allows me to do is login to my account and that's it. I'm sad about it.

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I recently started using it again and was surprised by the quality of the audio library. My biggest confusion came when I used the speed ramp option on a low bitrate video. When I wanted to export it, the rendering just to get 1% was about 5 minutes! I rebooted the phone and the app, but no luck. At this pace this little 23 second video will be finished rendering by Christmas."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have used dozens of video editing apps out there, and none come even close to Adobe rush. Now I know that you only get Adobe rush if you have a Domi Premier and the subscription which is sort of a bummer, but if you do have the ability to use Rush there is nothing other like it. it is very comprehensive in the things you can do color grading adding transitions adding effects"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily complicated and I'm an editor ü§¨"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't render the video at all, so buggy. Expected more from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelenteüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First video. It's for friends and family. Pretty easy to use, especially when. You consider I did the whole thing on my phone. In about an hour."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very unstable. The only way to get it to work is to constantly delete the cache after every project. It has great potential just like the desktop app. Adobe needs to fix this asap."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app should be renamed to premiere crash. It is completely useless to me. 1. The Adobe CC isn't compatible with Snapdragon 8cx. 2. The app crashes even after deleting app data, uninstalli g the app and reinstalling the app. 3. There aren't enough manual controls. These are my top 3 issues wkth the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Haven't been able to run it once.. it starts and after one second it closes itself"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is a great idea poorly executed. It's just like a AAA video game these days. Riddled with bugs and crashes on release. I could see this app becoming a very valuable tool in the future, but for now it lacks simple features and has too many problems to recommend."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Inspite of 8 gb ram this app doesn't rendaring a 10 min file, this is not expected from Adobe rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"APP CRASHES IMMEDIATELY! UN-USABLE. DON'T DOWNLOAD! Been like this over 2 months!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cant use it because my gmail is already used somehow and ove never used this app. I cant rate this properly how do you find out the email blazeblaze8888 like its random"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I have to uninstall and reinstall everytime I want to use the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice! But i think i should be able to find app from apps with word ""adobe"". üí©üëªü§¨ü§ñü•∞üòÇü§†"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst app ever made. Even it hangs the most advanced phones with high-end specifications. There are alot of better apps than this which will serve your video editing purposes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is nuce"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even loop a video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I doesn't show my video on screen useless app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I haven't been able to open the app. It crashes at start up and closes almost instantly. I've rebooted my device (Samsung S10e), checked for updates and I'm still having this problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe ü§ç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never works. Stays crashing. Can't even open it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exlent and Professional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"We need sound editing. Fade in and fadeout"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"only thing you should add is that background change and select the main part"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for adjusting video speed!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every video that I upload to Rush sets the wrong speed for the audio (roughly 50%), distorting all vocals. These files were recorded on the same phone that I am using the Rush app on, my Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Because of this, the software has been rendered useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app kinda sucks, long videos (8+ minutes) heavily loose their quality especially at the end and it also sometimes just cuts off chunks of the video. I would definitely not use this to edit long videos and the tools sometimes work. Mind you that I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra so I do have enough power to edit long videos, my mistake was thinking that just because this is an Adobe product it would work great. As it turns out it's not as good as it should be. Please fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am using a paid version and lemme tell you this app is trash. It freezes constantly and take ages to download, sometime 3 days (after freezing every damn minute) I have to uninstall and install a thousand times. I am sick of it. Despite of paid version, and because its a garbage, I had to use paid version of filmora and its so much better than this!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Studdering playback while editing (and also studdering after export)...using a Oneplus 9. App is useless in current state. No update since April... Common Adobe!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless even if you have an existing Adobe subscription. I signed in with my Adobe CC login but it still only provides three free exports. Seems like a bit of a scam. UPDATE, August 2021 This app has become all but useless, crashes on start up and the only way to get it running is by manually clearing the cache and then signing in again. Such a shame Adobe can't put all that money they make from ripping off their users into building a better mobile video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Excellent interface, but after all the work it just says 'can't publish video to YouTube'. So not useful for that purpose."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There is no pan and zoom for video clips!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not many features are available and no way to switch to landscape mode. No option for image stabilization and many more It is way too basic. I thought it would be more for professional use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This app is crashing down everytime I try to open it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What in the world is that effect, and it's totally lag"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The time you save working directly on a mobile device is consumed by Rush's clunky user interface, horrible bugs, and bizarre control scheme. The ap feels neglected, which is sad considering how close Rush is to what I wish it was."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Just not working........."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Works great for a while but eventually starts crashing. It's gotten to a point where I can only use the app with mobile data and wifi disabled."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Though not as simple as I have expected but it has a great deal of features and very creative."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible, all exports stutter, Adobe should be doing better on such a basic app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Faltu app hai... Sab kuch paid Download mat karna.. try karne ki vi jarurat nahi"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very very very good app. It's Useful app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing. I made a 3 min video but can't even access it because the app keeps crashing. Just lost hours on a student project that won't get turned in on time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The doesn't even open for me. As soon as I tap the icon to open the app it attempts to load up and then boom I'm back looking at my daughter's face on my phones home screen; the app just stops"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Often hang issues Late rendering Worst experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is surprisingly just garbage, I've used a lot of editors and I must say I'm very disappointed in Adobe. It works, but the interface is very buggy, a lot of controls are missing or impossible to find, like cropping/panning. Worst of all, the audio is always super buggy even after the video is rendered. I'm honestly just baffled that something made by Adobe is so... well terrible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"An incredibly easy to use and surprisingly capable Premiere Pro experience for mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I wasn't blown away and I feel there are better editing apps out there for phones a be d tablets. Take audio for example. A simple task to dip the audio manually at the end of a sequence is impossible. I was going round in loops to try to add in a fade. I did get a reasonable edit but the app is lacking the bells and whistles and little extras from other applications out there."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This ousam apk for android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Amazing!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is awesome. But ( so much lag please lag fix ) and adobe Premiere rush. I really request, you added also a ( future ) green background cutter. We will be of great help to people in making videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is GARBAGE everytime I edit a video and put countless hours into it, getting it just right and finally export it, to find out one scene didn't save the corrections I made to it. It's happened on almost every video I've made with this app. So frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ÿØÿØŸÅ⁄Ø"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Unreliable... Good WHEN it works, but recently, literally can't even open it on Pixel 5. It opens, then crashes & have tried reinstalling etc. Shamefully proving as unreliable & crash-happy as all other Adobe software. Sort it out!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Audio drift is a massive issue when the video is rendered"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A great app for editing videos, I would totally recommend"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This editor is really old I can say"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wrost app, I installed it but it didn't work, help me or improve it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nekiuf"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love everything Adobe has to offer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The function is generally very good. Sometimes it is a little buggy when uploading new clips. Exit and reopen fixes that. Adding subtitles to your video is a horrible experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe Premiere Rush, I enjoyed it as I am enjoying Adobe Premiere Pro on my PC."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very Excited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't add my songs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Before was good app, unfortunately now keep crashing, freezing and immediately logs me out of the app. Got tired of keeping reinstalling it, uninstalling then installing it back again, as temporary solution. Contacted the developers to fix with no response..my last option is posting negative feedback."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Surely Adobe !!! Loving it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb apps. Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps kicking me off so I have to reinstall each time I want to use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage app, oversize files convertions to crash life integrity of sd and internal storage totally innecesary, also, last version exports with artifacts, forcing people to pay for it, it is a totally scam, i doubt this be from adobe, adobe is a professional company, this apps doesnt looks made by them"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow and laggy on a Note 10. Sometimes the video doesn't even play while editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why does it keep crashing when I open it?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loved it. It's a fantastic application when I even compare to iMovie on my iPhone. Keep the good work going team"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice and good App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like this apps but please add some more features like keyframe and some new transaction"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's not Premiere, but it's better than getting out of bed to sit at my desk. 10/10 would stay in bed again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rush Rocks!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"We really need audio scrubbing capabilities to be able to know where we are with the audio. I cut my videos on the beat and not having that audio scrubbing feature really makes it almost impossible to do."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not usable at all , failed to export video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waiste of Money!!! The reason why this product is a waste of money because it is ""Only"" $10 a month but a year you are paying them $120 dollars a year. Use Filmora! Its a awesome app only for $20 dollars a year! Rush: $10 dollars a month=$120 a year Filmora: $20 a year! Rush: Lazy title fonts Filmora: 100's of fonts!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need more options.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Honor 7x phone not working this app you suggest Honor 7x new version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Software is weak. Can't load high framerate video and high res video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is still constantly crashing as soon as you open it, any ideas when this is going to be addressed?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing and doesn't complete a full export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Baby-premiere =)) Like intuitive and minimalistic UI"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I pay for this app and it will not stay open or it just crashes as soon as I open it. Please fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A very great app. I love the fact that the free version doesnt come with a watermark and it contains all basic video editing tools. Big thumbs up to the developers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app completely wasted my time. I edited a video for about 30mins, finished and left the video to render. Only to come back an hour later seeing it stuck a 37%. Nothing else on my phone was running. I canceled and started rendering again, it hangs at 2%.. Uninstalled. Waste of time and storage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing now. Can't download my videos anymore."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Flipping brilliant little app. I use FCP X on my laptop. This free app from Adobe is super-easy to get to grips with. Figured it out in seconds. Includes built in colourisation tools (like a LUT), Speed ramping, desqeezing anamorphic, and the list goes on. Recommended"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling each time I want to use the app, fix it from crashing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow, lagging, and crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Hope they add a subtitle effect eventually."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app i ever seen... I think kinemaster is the best video editer in mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What do we pay adobe for? App was great when I first downloaded it. even though I have worked with the desktop version of premiere there is still a bit of a learning curve with the mobile version. few weeks later the app crashes for no reason just from start up. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get anything out of it. and after that right back to square one. adobe has yet to fix the issue and it's been over 3 months probably longer. I wouldn't complain if it was all free but I pay y'all!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful üòå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot export videos it's stuck on 1 percent for ever ...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable, crashes as soon as I open it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"5.0 star üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to install"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëåüëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"UPDATE 7-21-21: Continually crashing and not loading to login to a professional account. Basically unusable. Really needs more accessible tutorials and it's incredibly frustrating to use some of the controls on a touch screen. It also doesn't seem to include an auto caption feature which makes it inaccessible. Do better Adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes after starting. It is virtually unusable!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great product. Easy to understand. Very convenient on the go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for beginners"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome video editors apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great but needs improvement."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Useless for me. Don't like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Super fast and reliable ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is ok, but very large and crashes a lot. Doesn't sync video in background, AND when you purchase premium through Google play, it ONLY applies those features to mobile, not all devices on the connected account. If you edit or export on PC or Mac, you still have the same features and restrictions as the trial version and have to pay again for full version. So don't be like me and buy a one year subscription only to still have to buy a monthly subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Has everything I need to put clips together with music but bugs out and becomes totally unusable after 5 minutes. Turns 20 minute projects into 2 hour projects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsme"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't import video recorded on a pixel 5. I guess it doesn't support h265? Makes it kinda useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use but, It will be much better if we can manage the level of sound tracks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great app!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very powerful yet professional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Haven't even played it yet but way to long to download"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"7-19-21. SAMSUNG FIX . Samsung PDF is interfering with all Adobe apps. Go to find - type Samsung pdf - hit locate app - UNINSTALL. Also UNINSTALL ADOBE RUSH. Next go to your Creative Cloud APP and download ADOBE ACROBAT - next download ADOBE RUSH."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Update: contacted developer over a month ago and no update on this issue. Keeps crashing on opening. Used to work great. I guess I will cancel my subscription since they do not want to fix the issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app used in my entire life"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing is all I can say!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love this for editing videos quickly to post on social media (typically to make a timelapse/speed drawing or painting). I wish there were more options for editing text, but there is enough for it to still be useful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was able to complete one project successfully and it was a great experience. But ever since then, every time I open the app it crashes within seconds. This has been ongoing for 2 weeks. What's up Adobe? When are you going to fix this bug? I'd like to be able to use the service that I pay for on my phone too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why does it take so much time to render the video. I am stuck."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice Editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app please don't use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Well-done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great editing features, but every video I create has these weird blackouts and glitches???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Buena app y muy r√°pida, aunque aveces no es intuitiva"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash. Slow, buggy and can't render one minute video properly... App crashes when progress bar reaches to 95% after waiting for ages. I would never recommend this waste of time to anyone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"its free !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Soo good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Youcut is better"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It showed 3 - days trail but I was charged directly for annual subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just straight up crashes when I try to Export a Project. Unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"worst app it have nothing like KineMaster not better than KineMaster."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app üôÅü§ß"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I used it before, but the videos on YouTube are very buggy, so I don't want to use it anymore."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's a waste to pay for this app for mobile version as it is very inconvenient to use on mobile. I find it worthless. I really regret paying INR 2650 for this. I tried canceling it and get my money refunded but there is no way for this. Bad experience and sheer wastage of money"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Since I added my paid account details. The app is crashing I can't even logout"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love being able to make quality video when away from a desktop"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"good editing app but started corrupting audio after a couple uses"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for mobile..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app. We can trim video from every second. It is very easy to use. And the effects available in the app is super."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Filmorago is better than Adobe p rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is so unresponsive and laggy it is physically unusable (Galaxy S10+). Even imovie on my iphone is better than this junk."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, semi-professional editor for mobile. I would recommend this and Powerdirector."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ui is buggy, would barely load, videos and photos are just a black screen, audio is sometimes lowered shortened and distorted, and the whole app is borderline usless. As a paying customer for adobe's other products, I expected better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes, talked to Tech multiple times and they cannot help me. There is enough storage on my phone, I just bought it it has 128 gigs and it's the Samsung Galaxy s20 Fe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Always difficult to export videos after editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes often, laggy, buggy, limited. Youcut has been a far better option, and I use the free version. Adobe seems lazy with theobile offerings. Either too bloated to justify cost, or too boxed and limited to be worth the time. These creative mobile apps are slow to open and use, not what a mobile user wants. Do better Adobe, your brand name isn't enough to carry you in this space."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I've tried several projects with multiple clips that total to greater than 25 mins. The export completes successfully, but the output file has an error in that it plays fine up to the 20 min mark and then video hangs while audio continues. I don't have this problem as long as the exported video is less than 20 minutes. Using latest version on Galaxy Note 10. Is there a way to fix this without editing the entire video from the beginning in another editor?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Where's the reverse clip function"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I don't understand why premiere rush doesn't have zoom transition"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is stupid, premiere rush is available for my old note 8, but not optimized with my new galaxy tab 6."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It can't redeem multi clips together"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Nice app but some problems this app no effects and graphics"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Easy to manage, but constantly crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled many times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Please make a smaller version of apk like vivo y15 the app is crashed again and again . When I edit my video the monitor is blank. So please make stable version for vivo y15 vivo y15 is my device . App is great but it's crashed badly."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not really usefull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Disapointed with Adobe. This was a free software previously to be used both in the pc and mobile, but they have started charging for the app. I dont think this app is quite good to be a paid one. We have better options for that. Finally uninstalled üòè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I already asked for a refund, this app doesn't works l, it never allow you to render your work. Don't worth the money"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"DOPE"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Originally this was really good but not allowed to export at all is bs. I understand features having access to a library of audio from Adobe but locking ability to export is horrible lightroom doesn't do this but rush does"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App is ok for light edits but not good for anything more complex. I tried to make a compilation video with one slow motion scene, some transitions, and a title and it simply refused to export it no matter what I tried. It's really disappointing when you spend a lot of time working on something and you can't even render it. Get it together adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Come on adobe fix this. It constantly crashes when I open the app. I uninstall and reinstall and even clear the cache. It's unusable *edit* I got it to work. I Uninstalled the app and didn't sign in to my creative cloud. I used a different login rather then the creative cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good appüíú"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can't adjust the aspect ratio to something specific. Totally worthless"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"wont even load or open after downloading"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I Paid for the app, initially it worked great. After a few uploads now it crashes, freezes and won't render an edited copy to my phones gallery. I'm only working with 1080p. I have hours of work that I can't use. Going to restart my edits on another app. I would like a refund"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Worth it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's very convenient and all that, but it keeps crashing, and the video messes up in that classic trademark Adobe way. Other than the constant bugs, it's pretty good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Fix up the app. Keeps crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Mobile version keeps crashing and the latest project doesn't sync with the desktop version. Plus projects that have been saved go missing from the mobile version. Paying a subscription for an absolute lousy application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This was a great app up until a few weeks ago, it keeps crashing and freezing. It's become frustrating and usable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's real good! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I use to love it but now I have to uninstall it and reinstall it to use it I've reported it but nothing happened"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just waste time and data.when i open it and add a video to edit the video play in a black screen. I tried many time and install it many time but i had face same problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Shows black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Rock!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good application and everything. But except for one problem when after I export and rendered the video, I rewatched the video I edited on and somehow it was lagging. I'm not sure why this occurred even when my recording was on a constant 60 fps without any lag. Now it was lagging from 60 to like 40 multiple times when I look at the video I recently edited on. I'm not sure if this is a bug but please fix if you can. Thank you!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It amazes me that I pay so much of my hard earned cash for Adobe's astonishingly unstable apps. This one crashes after open every time. Just worthless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Hey! I'm having some kind of troubles, app keeps crashing when internet is on but workin fine when internet is off."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Function well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a really great mobile editing app! üíØ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just Awesome! Use it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very laggy on a note 10+. No greenscreen options and overall not worth the pirce."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Used to work brilliant for me. But now it crashes and Everytime I have uninstall the app and reinstall. I've emailed and reported the errors lots of a few months now. Hopefully the problem can be fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Overall it's good but sometimes some clips of the videos are getting damaged."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Okay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Yes take a bit to get used to. Where are your edited video can be saved."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to have. Can pretty quickly put together video clips and photos, add audio and graphics, transitions, cut and move pieces of clips in the order you would like them."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It was easy to use and very reliable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is is the most frustrating and disappointing video editing application I've ever used! And I'm on the annual premium package!!!! It keeps hanging, freezing, when I give up on editing and try to export, it only shows RENDERING for hours! I've cleared cache and data, uninstalled and reinstalled and same thing! Can you please fix this issue?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm a paid member of adobe suite. Rush keeps crashing even after uninstalling and reinstalling."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app does nothing but crash everytime I use it. What's the point of paying monthly for an app that never works properly üò°üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ complete wist of time!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good for quick video edits. I encountered some problems cause i tried to export a file larger than 10 gb, it literally freezed at the background for 2 days. I have a high end phone so its definitely the app's problem. Basically Not suitable for complicated or large projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe should help integrate audio mixer and noise reducer into the app. Its a great and nice app-on-the-Go."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Minimal standard..Not as kindmaster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app, easy to use and figure out. Only issue i have is that sometimes my fingers are too big for the preciseness needed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't download please help."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lite Premiere pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes when attempting to save video. Editing and then saving videos to share with others is pretty much the reason to have this app, so it's inability to accomplish this makes it useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty easy editor w/ some good features, but the best features you have to pay for and the app isn't compatible with some of the newest phones (esp some w/ great cameras like Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G) so there's a lot of room for improvement here. Also adobe customer support sucks and they hide their contact info and give customers the same advice over and over again. We've spent 8 hours on the phone running in circles with creative cloud issues and they're still unresolved. Poor QC & CS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Insane and free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App won't load video files to edit. Sound cuts out frequently making editing a headache. Each update renders this app more and more useless so I'll be looking for an alternative and you should too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately since the last update the app keeps crashing right after opening it. So opening projects, editing or basically doing anything is impossible. At first I thought that it was an error on my end but seeing that other people experience the same problem it is very disappointing since I genuinely like this app. But until the problem isn't fixed I can't give a higher rating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's a fun mobile video editor with a great interface. Just learning it. Hoping there's functionality to import gifs & user created overlays. It was nice until the update. Now it crashes constantly. All i really get to see is the home screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"What a great apps, u dont need to open laptop to combine, create effect, edit ound, and many other features. Thanks."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was exporting a 10 min video.. Last few minutes there are certain frame drop on final product.. Then I re exported it and same problem was there. Where as other app like inshot give me very good results. My device is poco x3 pro 8 gb ram."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best video editing appüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wont export and save to my phone. It also wont upload to any social media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I like this editor. But I got problem, stuck on export."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"YOU CANNOT EXPORT FROM A MOBILE DEVISE! The last update is just horrendous. JUST LOOK AT THE FORUMS 600 REPORTS ZERO ANSWERS OR FIXES. Disgusting behaviour Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"First its work well after one month of used my edited videos audio sound has crashed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very powerful and easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really easy to use and play around with"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. Everytime I try and open a project it crashes. Have reinstalled and still no luck. Never had any issues with other apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty amazed that was so quick and easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm using a Pixel 4a so it won't install. I side-loaded the apk and it works well! Not sure why there is the extra hurdle but the app itself is great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Works fine but instantly crashes if i dont open it with the phone on airplane mode. Ubsyre ehy its necessarily looking for internet 24/7 instead of only when needed. The app needs retooling as its crashing as soon as i open it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Descent."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App not working on my Samsung s10 Note"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My phone has pretty high specs for a phone... The app is still slow and crashing.. its impossible to export as it is stuck in rendering for a lifetime"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was trying the free trial and now I can't even unsubscribe. I tried uninstalling it then install again with no luck. I guess I'll be charged for this app even when it doesn't work. I want out please................"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very nice application. I use it for social media content small videos & even for My YouTube channel video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good experience when I'm actually in the app. But I'm giving it 2 stars because it crashes on me nonstop. The only way I can make it work is that I download it and work on it as much as possible. Next time I open the app, it crashes, so I Uninstall it, re-download it, then work on it as much as possible. Will be looking for another video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constant crashes as soon as you open the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very very good for a free app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dont accept the free trial, if you forget to cancel it, theyll put you on a 1 yr plan where u pay monthly. if u cancel theyll charge u $149. Dont download this app unless you will commit to using it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The video never renders as edited or sequenced. The app hangs quite a bit and the preview isnt in sync with the frames and audio which makes it really difficult to edit videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ThanksFully"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tried downloading two times"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing everytime I open it. Very annoying. Please fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Mostly very solid, probably the best video editor on Android. Two big flaws are it lacks the ability to generate graphics other than a few pre-mades. Prepare to take some photos and edit the brightness up if you want white backgrounds or text. More bafflingly there's no way to SEARCH for media to add. You can look through Device Folders but even then the folders are completely randomly sorted instead of by alphabetical or date modified. Finding a track of music to add was near impossible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Literally the best mobile editing app. Adobe experience on mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freezes and crashes constantly on Galaxy S10+ Super obnoxious because I have a paid subscription and I cant even use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"In this app video editing is so simple and it's not hard to use for everyone it's so simple üëçüëç‚ù§Ô∏èüòÉüòé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app crashes every time I open it, I pay for this service but I can't use it. It's unacceptable. I have tried to contact Adobe for assistance but it's impossible to reach anyone. I don't like to leave a bad review but this issue has been ongoing for months now with no resolution. When the app works I like it, but the app doesn't work. So don't bother."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The application is crashing every time I open. Please check on the this issue immediately."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy use for beginner"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing!!!!!! I read the comments and it seems like the problem has been there for a while. Very disappointed!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just started but it is a whole new world opening up!!!üëåüèæ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe was and will be my software for anything creative, this time it's video editing on android, woof , Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This apps interface is alright. But there are two problems. When I add music to any project it becomes crackily and very poor, and you should be able to export in 4K regardless of what quality clips you have. Upscaling isn't an issue in other editors, so for Adobe not to do this is very poor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The new update is not loading and just crashes out. I uninstalled and now it won't reinstall. I really need this to be available on my phone. Why am I paying for something when it is completely unusable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not useful for evryone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I had low expectations, but this app far surpassed them."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"i love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceeds expectations!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very goodüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"What a great program. I have used Adobe premiere pro a couple years ago. This is pro but the easier friendlier phone version. It really makes it easier to make videos and post to social media."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering takes days n days. Despite doing the payment getting no result.. pathetic."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Colour correction is just great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I add video file but video cannot play ....every"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I recently bought a Galaxy S21 ultra, with pretty high specs and the newest Android Vers. and for some reason, I can't install it on my phone. My old phone, which was a note9 with lower specs ran the App fine. I pay for Adobe Creative Cloud, with everything incl. so there's literally nothing stopping me, except for an error. Please fix this, quickly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Such a great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Choppy, crashes, doesn't respond, worst video editing app, you would think Adobe would be able to get things right but it just straight up doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Poor UI, not intuitive. No ads is nice, but doesn't much mater if the app is unusable."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Lanscape mode, Portrait mode, Landscape mode, Portrait mode and so on and so on until I lock my phone and unlock with a shortcut to a background app so I can use my softkeys and kill the app. It does this as soon as I open the app. Please fix this problem, I really do love your applications."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing!!! Its has really goood editing tools and very easy to use... If you can actually use it. Keeps saying could not load project or video ...."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best üëçüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm having the same issue as everyone else, if I uninstall and reinstall it works one time. After that, it crashes upon opening. The app was already buggy before, which I honestly expect with all Adobe products. Now its completely unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is very good for editing videos and it is not having any watermark"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am in the same situation as so many, if I uninstall then reinstall, it works once then.. Every time I open the app before anything, it crashes and closes. Until I uninstall and reinstall, then it works once again. Very very frustrating. It only started once I logged into my Adobe account to use the pro version. I really hope this gets solved asap."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the edits!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At the moment Rush is unusable. I have used it in the past without a problem but now .... it is slow, intermittent and I cannot copy video out of Rush to share as I please. What the heck Adobe????"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Takes absolutely forever to render the smallest of edits. I wanted to export a video I made at 720p 60 fps and after half an hour I decided enough was enough."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The Best app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It very nice video editor but I don't have pro version and it doesn't have Cromakey option but nice appüôÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice App but expensive for premium and good only for minimal edit doesn't have options needed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Rendering issues need to be resolved.. after rendering the 10 min video fps dropped from 60 to literally 1 fps hardly at the end of the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even resize a video ?"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use its a great editor app has everything at your fingertips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot add text on video easily. It adds as separate video text and adds just on top of that video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the the editing on Rush. Fast and high resolution video export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst editor ever. Editing crashes in the middle and can't play the edited video after that. I'm using a High end mobile and even with that specs it can't edit. Rendering takes hell of a time in this thing. No use for me till now Kinemaster is lot better than this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Shuts down appallingly often and exports with out of sync audio half the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good editor when it works but crashes when opened after it works properly from the first install. Even after a fresh install it works again the first time then crashes every time after. That's a big problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After my Experience This App Is So Bad!.When I Put My Photos Or Media They Are All Grayed Out. Im Only Changing my Review When This Is Fixed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't Rush good work! Honestly just use Premiere on desktop. It's way faster and efficient than using this app just to feed the a.i. the a.i. hasn't done us any favors lately anyway which is obvious since this app is unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What gives adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect. I got what I wanted."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for a quick edit. Intuitive with that touch of professional editing suite !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Moved from Galaxy Note 20 Ultra to Galaxy S2 Ultra, sadly, the app isn't compatible even after 4 months of launch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Its a good tool to work with until you reach the point where the project has to be rendered. I spent hours together finishing a project but when started rendering, it is always stuck at 1%. Its so frustrating. Not sure whether its only with me. So, better try to render a simple one before you start any serious project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crash all the time. Please fix the issue ASAP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loading screen shows again and again.....Slow app, lag, worst app everüò≠"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is good for video editing in android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Last week I decided to upgrade so I could use the creative cloud and edit on my computer as well. The file took forever to upload so I had to just re-download on my computer. When it came time to export, I only got 3 exports on my computer which wasn't specified in the different upgrade options. On my next project, I edit on my phone b/c I was in a rush, when I export the video starts to lag and freezes while the audio keeps playing. No solution since 2019 when others had the same issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"One of the worst editing apps I have had I'm not trying to mean but please update your app and make it better. One thing you could do it maybe make it less glitchly ik how hard you guys work on these apps but the way to get good reviews is to make people like it. But first things is to make it look good!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great and now it just crashes upon opening constantly which makes me excited that I paid for it for a good job Adobe if I could give you 0 Stars I absolutely would I used to use this everyday and now this piece of trash won't even open"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"From Premier Pro to this. Its easier to use.. its more like on the go video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's great for the bar minimum, but I would like to see more adjustability for the placement of effects, adding text within the video, and transitioning."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"How to Uninstall and reinstall every time I want to use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Big adobe fan but this app does not work well when I try to export a project to my device."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am paying for this service each month so I beg the developers to fix it!! I have never had a problem with Rush before the last update. Ever since then, the app crashes every single time I open it so it's unusable. I need to use rush when I'm on the go since it's part of my job. Please fix this asap!! We are all paying customers who deserve an app that works properly every time."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good app overall as it does what I need it to. But every now and then I will get a ""Direct upload error"" message and my app will close. Other times a video that I just edited will glitch, causing me to have to start over and create a whole new video"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Vry nice app i rated 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolute Junk. You would think for the amount you have to pay for an Adobe subscription that they would have working apps. Not really so. How disappointing. Will have to fork out MORE MONEY for a different app that works."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Came back to give this app a chance, nice to see that it has only gotten worse. Expect constant audio corruption, video lagging, and headaches. I dont understand what's so difficult with having the app function with the amount of programs this company has made."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is a team of robbers!!! I downloaded their app, from Google play store. After what I tried using a premium feature like audio noise reduction. They then showed me a plan to pay... once I done so, they tried charging me 3 times the annual plan. I contact Adobe, they tell me the app on the play store is not theirs and I should contact the seller!!! FOOLISHNESS!!! ROBBERY!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's good but it glitches alot"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Clean simple and easy to use. Perfect for clipping resizing combining and changing be speed of clips. It has improved since I first installed it. The one key feature I'm waiting for is to be able to reverse clips."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Final audio skips and video playback is super jittery."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful video editing software and its free? What are you waiting for? Lol"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too many flaws. Pulls up the wrong media, despite having selected the correct one when creating a video. Editing the graphics is problematic have highlight several times before I can actually input text. Freezes up, sound will play while video is frozen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Infuriating app. Everything is hard to do than any other video editor i ever used. I wish I could get my money back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very bad experience. I am a regular user of Adobe apps. I am using their photography plan since years in my Surface Pro. Wanted to get into video editing and paid for Rush Mobile app, editing whole of my video, but it stucks in Export. I tried with different export settings but it stucks after sometime. I'm using OnePlus 7 Pro with 12GB Ram. Also the app makes the phone very hot while using a few things like applying transitions, speed, etc. Although, I do like Rush 's features, easyTouse."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This is a toss up. The app is nice about drag and drop and editing. I thought everything was good there. The lag and slowness of this app even on a decent phone is kinda crazy. Took me 5 minutes to get my previous project to open up after closing the app. Exporting goes well so far but I've seen reviews of it going bad. Haven't had issues yet. Might not keep it installed if it's going to be this laggy with projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Uploads to the cloud are extremely slow, has lots of great features, but hard to make polished content from your phone on your lap top"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app makes it easier to edit my videos, but recently it's been crashing too often. I keep having to reinstall the app for it to work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use all the way around!"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless, dont bother. They dont."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It was good at first then the videos started to glitch"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wrost app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Probably the most unstable paid video editing apps from a major player. Constant freezing, crashes mybsystem, sync issues, and expensive. The phone app is slightly better than the app on my PC and Mac. It was a promising app with great functionality. Not worth the money. Extremely frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling for it to work. Only get one use before it freezes and becomes useless. Really ruins the convenience and am about to cancel my Adobe subscription since I use this app the most. Bummed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If there is a zero, I will rate it zero.. I can't even use it at all keep on crashing what a waste sooo useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I live everything about this apps. Except It wont render my bideo in my Galaxy s10+ phone. Rendering stucked at 3 or 4 percent. So frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Cannot handle multiple and large videos, keeps crashing. Takes forever to just add or delete a clip."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. Can't open properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Frigging awsome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The Premium feature buy stated that I will be changed after a 3-Day trial period . I purchased it on 23-5-2021 and got charged immediately . I couldn't see any of the features ( 4K export , Audio Export , Motion Effects ) even after troubleshooting ( reinstalling the app , re-login , force close ) . So I decided to end within my trial - TODAY ( as i didn't get the features as promised ) . Google Play doesn't refund even though am in my trial ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The go to app for video editing on android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"please sing in auto"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app was great but since the update I'm having difficulties actually downloading the videos I've created. I pay a yearly subscription but can't actually download the videos I've made. So will definitely be cancelling. Such a shame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Bad experience üòê"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow this is amazing it got all the tools needed to edit my videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst editing app of all time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stopped using it awhile back, decided to try it again, and what a disappointment. Rendering videos have some kind of hiccup, like all the time. Plus I'm only rendering a minute long video, what the hell?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use and I like the direct publish to social media and also I can create a video on the fly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just purely easy to use and amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I had to uninstall this app because it just doesn't work. Editing a video is actually pretty simple, so that's nice. But, videos do not render properly. Because of that, the app is essentially useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It needs more optimizations"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Whate you would expect from a phone video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Full of bugs doesn't show video on preview monitor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to handle for new bee"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good compared to other apps I tryed using a load of apps for a school prodgect yet they all wanted you to pay to do really simple things where as this works really well and feels professional it also has a version to pay for but I'm glad they made it good for the free version it dose come with a few glitches but nothing that bad."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes!!! ??"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app from past 1 year... Recently the app is a completely disaster... Not even a single 4 second is rendered... Disappointed üëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i produced two vids (25 & 42 mins; source are GoPro hd and 4k clips). it appears to produce full-length vids, but when the player (google photos or samsung app) gets to ~20 mins, the image is clear but stops or hiccups/skips significantly and the audio continues. if i advance past the trouble point, the playhead jumps back to the problem point. i made the same vids in PowerDirector and the output plays perfectly. so it's not the source clips, my phone or vid player. it's rush, right? please fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It was a rocking editing software. It's one of the only free mobile apps to have a B-Roll option. It sucks however that it crashes. It's very unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool , like a pc edit ! Love this app !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing all the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Too much goodüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Experienced Premiere Pro user here. Rush tends to be laggy, less powerful, and far less intuitive; on-the-go editing is nice though when you can't get to a computer right away."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unintuitive when determining size of exported vid, makes it smaller for some reason and can't use the fit screen nor fill screen options."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So many issues , lagging problem , export glitch.... such bad experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful program. You have to follow the right flow chart of editing on a phone bases software. Stable and precise ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is an excellent editing tool! It doesn't only make editing easy, it also makes it fun. It's the best mobile editing tool I've seen so far."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app. Hoping for more features in future updates."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great app but when exporting the video, a random black strobe effect appears on the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Amazing app but takes forever to render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes as soon as I try to create a project. Can't do anything with it. Desktop version let's me get part way through editing then freezes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best for beginners as i am one of them thanks üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Please fix this app for the Pixel phones - the app crashes Everytime"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use for simple edition and no in app purchases"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Everything was fine and I subscribed but suddenly the last 2 months have been bad. The video will stop rendering at about 80% and then now it's very pixelated after processing. Please fix this issue and once it solved I will update here before you guys download this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good and handy to use still more option to be involved"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent for on the go edits on test videos for customers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everytime I Creat A Project And Add A Video My Video Becomes A black screen and its annoying i wont change my review after this problem is fixed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not worth it on Android or PC slow and buggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's genuinely like a mini Premiere in my pocket. Outstanding!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Damnüî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice. Beautiful.app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have been a regular user of Adobe Premiere Pro so I subscribed for this app but I found it of no use. It no way near to match Adobe Premiere pro. Not a user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes my whole phone all the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps closing. It worked for the first couple months, now after updating, it keeps closing on me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Did not had a good experience with the app it crash as soon as you open it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It is good as free and has enough functions that need for simple video editing. However, when I tried to render a 4MB file it took forever, while other apps just took a few tens of seconds."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was going to use this for making my YouTube videos but when I put my into in it muted the music which is free to use music. Also froze quite often needing the app to be closed and re opened."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app don't install it.. time waste, data waste,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è very good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have paid and bought the pro version for a year. Looks like a waste because everytime I am trying to render any project I get an error at around 80% saying ""something went wrong please open project again"". If you guys can't resolve this then please refund my money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice man"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worked fine enough for a couple months. Now every export is glitched, specifically it'll export the full audio, but only 60% of the video (leave the video to freeze on a single frame for the remainder of the export). I've tried different settings, different videos uninstalling and reinstalling. If it can't simply export then the app is basically useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editing app for android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great video editing app for Android. I've only been using it for mostly putting clips together and it works fine. But even 2 clips at 25 fps that are less than a minute total, it can take 20 minutes to render and sometimes they render poorly. I have a OnePlus 7 pro which uses the Snapdragon 855, not the highest end but it's very close up there when you consider all the phones on the market. No watermark though and it is free so it is worth giving a shot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I like the idea of simple additions and quick rendering but the easy of use must be improved. Just to add text should be more simple. I shouldn't have to attempt to click on a very small text box. It should just be in the bottom menu like the other settings."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app uptill now Thanks adobe for this ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best Quality Product and most recommended application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After using kinemaster you never gonna like this app.. this app is almost useless for a youtuber... And it has very very less amount of features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's giving me a error just saying error . when i want to add files"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty good. Nice and intuitive for simple tasks. Lovely."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it but it is to expensive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Extremely streamlined and not buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rubbish"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work. Never exports without endlessly hanging. Oneplus 9."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've been using another app to edit my videos and thought I'd try out Rush. I uploaded about 4 minutes of video, made a few changes, and clicked play. The video plays only audio without advancing the video and then stalls. I have to keep restarting my phone. I'm glad I did this test run bc I would've been quite upset if I'd paid for the premium version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"#1 easy way to start off"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After one edit it stopped openingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Before it was pretty good but now it tries to be just another stupid app :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"it lags and sometimes the video doesnt play so i have to exit the app a lot of times"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible!! Just HORRIBLE !!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wasted my time and energy. The app wont finish rendering and get stucks at a certain percentage. One hour of my time editing is wasted"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like it so far!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was able to edit 1 video a month ago now I cant even review videos to see where I want to cut or transition every time I import a video it always glitches during playback."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Its lagging alot i spent 4 days to to make20 min video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I (re)downloaded this app & deleted it in less than a minute. I miss Adobe Clip. Didn't have to pay to edit your own videos or use the features provided (why even offer certain things if you have to pay?), not absolutely hideous to look at, & not nearly as buggy (when they were keeping up with it). There's a reason I switched to InShot once they stopped updating Clip. This app is just as terrible as when it began - if not worse! Usually apps get better as time goes on & updated; not this one."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"goodluck"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than the previous video editing software I used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was working fine, but all of sudden it's constantly crashing. üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Renders quickly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"this app is good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Kept crashing had to delete"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When it works it's great but it keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"How can I add pre recorded audio clip in it"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful App üëå up to the standards.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Some videos it keeps rendering forever, and don't complete."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great stuff"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice aap but somethimes it lags but rest featured tool are good to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The only real complaint I have is, I can't TYPE IN font sizes etc, so the slider ends up being way too sensitive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super easy and user friendly for those who have never edited video before."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It would 5 if it didn't crash half the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This application is professional Edition app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app üòâ Enjoyed this app üòÑ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This application support an massive hard ware but in the case of midrange phones doesn't can be processing and phone fixing problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'd buy it if it wasn't buggy. It's a decent app, I really like making videos for Insta and TikTok with it, but every week or so it gets stuck in a cycle of crashing, and I have to un/reinstall it. Which works for a few days, then I have to do it again. And I lose all my drafts when I do that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very very bad,, not user friendly, its worest"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"constantly crashjng on the note 10 unlocked android 11... give me my refund bro.. this is wack!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I like Adobe but this app on my Samsung is not the best video editing app. It is slow to edit the work flow, and then it does not want to export (current issue). I do feel that Adobe has a far way to go with this concept. There Lightroom app has made it and this should follow soon, hopefully."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App worked great until the last update. Crashes on startup EVERY TIME. Tried restarting, reinstalling all useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm still learning how to use this app but I love it so far. I'm excited to use my Note 10+ and Samsung's Dex app to edit video recorded on my phone with the benefit of being on my computer."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At first, I absolutely loved Premiere Rush; it was so easy to edit videos even frame by frame and was exactly what I was looking for. That was until I started seeing visual glitches on the video in the editor and after exporting. They are incredibly annoying as they effect the quality of the video. Recently, the app has been extremely choppy and buggy and crashes on me randomly. It lags a ton when playing the videos in the editor and makes it nearly impossible to edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Littered with so many problems a new one pops up on every use. If it isn't crashing every five minutes, the audio cuts out after a period of time, or the export speed is so abysmal it sometimes just stops moving all together. It's a shame because I used to use this app all the time, it's one of the only pieces of editing software that won't leave a watermark. Thanks guys, very cool, keep it up."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Goodüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"it gets the job done (I love it)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hi, I actually loved it to start with as it was very user friendly unlike others and once finished and started exporting it's been 5 hrs already and it's done 2% so probably will need an year to get the randering finished."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and intuitive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App keeps crashing. Worked fine first download on the demo video. No new patch yet but I know Adobe will fix the issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like a lot about it, and the things I can't do may be my fault because I'm new to video editing. Hesitant to give a 5 star until I better understand what I can and can't do"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even open it on my Note 20 Ultra. Force closes after 1 second."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is absolutely unreasonable how long it takes to render a video.... I made a 2 minute video that's taking over an hour to render. My phone has better specs than my laptop, so.... I expected better from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good but bugs out a lot. Always having to restart the app on my note10+. It's a free app with a paid tier but it would be good if the free graphics templates had a few more options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always have some different problems regarding export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazed!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disaster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app also only gives 2 options for cloud storage. Adobe people use Google drives and Microsoft one drive too. Disappointed this does not function cross platform. I pay adobe monthly for subscription. I cannot see projects made on my android phone on other devices (PC or surface pro). Then the app started crashing & never stopped. I'm reinstalling in hope it will function as advertised. Rush on PC is ok but so far this app is not working seamlessly with it or my phone- Samsung s9+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes and doesn't render. Have to repeat multiple times to get it to work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App not working , If I add a video layer video is not showing on audio is playing , I unable to add translation , unable to add text , unable to add filters , unable to add background music , Bakaar appüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing app! Had trouble rendering but realized I needed to update my app. Easy fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constant audio pops makes it so difficult to bloody edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible terrible video editor. Video and audio lags everytime you open a new project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't export rendering gets stuck on 0%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The preview screen is always black, can't find solution on any forms. Just wasted my time behind solving this issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it somuch"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Legit for mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freezes on export. With a very simple edit on a fast xiaomi phone. Lots of bugs for sure."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Khatrnak"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Do not that I'm NOT a video editing junkie. All I can say is, I use it pretty much for cutting clips only and it does the job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Interface difficult to navigate and missing basic features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super smash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Video playback screen black problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't export my project. Kept getting an error that stops it from rendering."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app in my whole life adobe good job editing so nice wowww love this app good job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App always crashes after opening. Have to Uninstall and reinstall. When it works, it's good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good app but I get black errors on exported videos, a black frame pops in every now and then, needs more export options for better quality videos, needs more audio options too. It's OK but needs improving."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful and simple editing on smartphone that takes best of Premiere Pro but tailored for those who want desktop-like editing but on a smartphone. Goes a long way to give you various export options and you have access to plethora of effects and more. Performance will vary based on supported smartphone, but works like a charm to have helped in creating videos while on the move."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its a good, quick editing app. Just wish there were more transition options in audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Thank you for making such a good app free. Pleasee have an Android tablet version soon !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick easy. Perfect for the road"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst app ever. Scam. You cannot export the video unless you enter your credit card details. I wasted 2 hours of editing. I have a Samsung Note 10 plus, which is a very powerful phone, yet the app was lagging. Further the video playback was very slow and the app sometimes got stuck and I had to literally force stop the app. P.S. If you are in the same situation as me, where you found out you had to pay for the app later. Just screen record, lose some quality but retain your work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everytime I colour grade a clip and hit apply to all clips then select another option or move the scrubber on the clip, the colour grade disappears. Such a waste of time using this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"simpel, nice!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ganda"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing! Works flawlessly on my Samsung s9+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"sadly sad ive already subscribed for a year and when im upgrading mobile phone to 12Gb and 258 Gb but this app not compatible hhaahahaa whatt.... i upgraded hp but it feels like i downgrade it because not compatible. beside that the transistion hardly to control and lack of uploading media. terrible apps... and ill ready made payment damn it !!! adobe rush failed app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"After some of these new updates, I can't add any new graphics. There's nothing happen after I click add. Tried clear cache, but now I can't see anything in the ""Graphics"" menu anymore"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time too much bugs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Convenient to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its wierdly unfunctional, a slight few changes such as allowing snap to grid movements would make it far superior. I edited a project which took longer then it should of I felt due to bad workflow and now it wont export. Wasted hours of my time. Normally im happy with adobe products but I have to give this a 1 star as it not only isnt as good as anticipated its actually wasted my time to. Its worth mentioning I'd pay money for this app if it was good and I'm sure a lot of other people would to."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you finally on Pixel 5 love everything about it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Couldn't render my project....it got stuck every time....worst app . Unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty decent videos editor, not suitable for people who wish to edit for free though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuck at 0% while rendering ( facing from last 4 days no fix yet )"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst only showing black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing upon start up, can't use after update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling this app the video playback won't show up no matter how much I try."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I hate this. I regret buying it. The free app I used was better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The features in this app is amazing, but there is a problem, everytime I want to export my videos, it is always stuck at 98%, pls fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"For most of my years I've used Adobe products and pay a yearly subscription. I've been happy with the softwares but this app is the worst one! So many problems with uploading files, editing, and more. I tried looking them up but the answers are usually move to a laptop or Uninstal and install the app which usually works. Preferably would not move to laptop as sometimes I am in a rush making videos. This is a really good idea for an app but this app really needs update and more work!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsome nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Amazing editing software, I would have given 5 stars if the app allows to edit in landscape mode."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good video editing. I use the free version. And it's was great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The swiss-army knife of edit tools!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Yall in trouble, I think I'm in love!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great if you got a high end phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was happy to use this to seamlessly edit videos in the cloud between my Samsung Galaxy Note 10 and Surface Pro, but I was annoyed it wouldn't run on my Samsung Galaxy Tab A. The I switched phones to a Galaxy Z Flip, another high-end Samsung phone with similar specs to my Note, but it's not compatible with my phone. I don't know why you even advertise this app as Android compatible if you only support a few phones. You should base the compatibility on hardware, not specific devices. This is terrible product management and took away yet another reason to spend hundreds of dollars a year on Creative Cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very disappointment with this app. When I add any effects they start lagging n freezing my video n very less options of effect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Really easy to edit videos with great quality and ease of use. I'd say the only things that could be improved is 1. Being able to reverse clips\videos and 2. Being able to use presents in the same way I can in Adobe Lightroom. If that was fixed I would easily rate this app 5 stars!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have issues with my OnePlus8 not being able to handle the app. Rendering freezes, video doesn't always load properly, etc. Makes editing and finalizing rather difficult. After more use, it seems to color invert on ever 3rd source file when rendering."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's very bad to ruin the quality of sound and music and the videos can't be opened I have to remove the app and return it to it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The easiest to navigate and intuitive software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far awesome.. But i just updated to Android 11... And the rendering is taking for ever..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashing when I try to save video to gallery"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need improvement in controls"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After latest update, app no longer renders videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Giving it a 2 star. While it does all the things I need it to do.. The Audio makes my voice sound like the speakers are blown! Once music is added AFTER video/still photos.. music sounds ok, until you have to adjust it to either the talking in the video.. or when you do voice over... no matter what you choose the voice/music sounds blown. If you adjust the volume up or down, it then gets massively worse! Please Fix!! I pay monthly for my subscriptions and Adobe should have this figured out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app but I want landscape mode editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly, so many YouTube tutorials guide you for editing. Highly recommended üòäüëçüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok fine ‚ù§Ô∏èüò°üíØ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for video editing but has no adjustment level and layer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome for quick video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Getting there. Not quite useable. Fast editor, decently intuitive buttons.... Lots of bugs and requires patient troubleshooting (sometimes a gesture to pinch, or a tap to select a clip will register, other times no response from the ui (often when cropping video)) Sometimes can't export projects (gets stuck, have to change export settings). Worst is when edits to clips won't save between sessions (often with crop edits). Audio is glitchy and skips upon export (no troubleshooting steps there)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"App good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app I found"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I enjoyed using rush for editing video in professional manner."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love it but it gets slow and weird at times"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It so very beautiful to experience this editor using your phoneüòá"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good for splicing and editing clips... terrible for adding graphics or txt for titles"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good App, but no support for the Galaxy Tab S7+? This tablet is Android's most powerful tablet...Please add support for it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"useless and complicated"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy way to make short videos, nice coloring too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App won't render, just crashes. Looks like it is a common issue. I wouldn't spend much time making a video before testing if rendering/export works on your device."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"#brutalistico"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Further features need to add in Rush,also it can make little more user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for youtube edits and basics. Nothing will beat final cut pro for intensive editing. I edied with adobe straight from my cell phone. Very basic. 4 videos spliced together. No transitions. Easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I would have bought this app but it's subscribe, nobody wants to subscribe to anything. This will be the downfall of all tech companies. Other than that this feels like a really well made app and they don't force you to add there name as a watermark."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for video editors in india"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible! You wasted my whole day! I used this app a few times and it was fine. Yesterday I spent 9 hours editing a video and it wouldn't export no matter what I did. I just tried reinstalling the app and lost all my projects. Don't waste your time! Adobe is straight garbage! You guys make trash!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing and Extraordinary app, just for free. And Quality is Crispüòçüòçüòçüëåüëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I can't export my videos it is showing Error saving file in disk please help"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice seems ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love it, although it occasionally it's a little buggy, it really enables me to make videos using my phone, instead of having to use a computer, just the level of detail I need and I can add music and have everything backed up on the cloud for a very reasonable price!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuck on fetching projects. Works well on windows but mobile is junk."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Brilliant free editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice and decent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Awful, UI rarely works as intended and the crashing is absurd. My phone is very powerful and this app crashes all the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app for on the go content creation!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It was good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lacking most of video editor tool. Force user to sync project to Adobe Cloud."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever, rendered a million times, still won't export properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lowering review to 1 star. The pressing play and having the video not play has made the app basically unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"An very simplified yet still awesome version of Pro. Great for making clips and short videos on mobile when you can't be infront a computer."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not the easiest to use but its all there"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Loading your own audio will often result in audio stutters/skips during video transitions (during playback and also with the exported final file). Seems like this bug has existed for a while now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"""could not create project""... Cool app. üôÑ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app with basic stuff..enough for a good video for beginners"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bekar He App"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glitch bugs lagg"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's slightly buggy, but does the job well! About as much as you can ask for out of editing on a phone touchscreen!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Happy that the free portion of the app allows a little more than just basic editing. Have been practicing using it so will now purchase a subscription to allow me to do more, (now that I am more experienced using it)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"**DO NOT BUY THIS APP!** PURCHASE DIRECTLY FROM ADOBE WEBSITE! Buy directly from Adobe not GOOGLE as THIS app is the mobile version and does not work cross-device as listed. I purchased paid version but it did not allow me to work on projects on my desktop.  After contacting Adobe they  informed me this was the MOBILE ONLY version and you cannot use it across multiple devices. I ended up having to purchase Adobe Rush from Adobe and I can use it seamlessly across multiple devices but can not"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A bit iffy but gets the job done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Being an experienced premier pro user. This is like a baby version for quick social media edits"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great and simple to make great short videos like for TikTok and IG. Getting the hang of using it was pretty easy and quick however, still learning all the tricks though. I'd definitely recommend using it. Only one real bone to pick with Premiere Rush is: when editing how laggy and choppy playback becomes especially, when your laying in a secondary audio file and the audio peaks out & flutters. I have to keep closing the app, clear its cashe and clear my phones memory cashe too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Features might be good but its taking hours and hours to render a 2 min video! This is on a oneplus 7t! Horrible! This app should be called Adobe premiere slow!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"when i started editing this is not showing preview of any type of video. now tell me how i can edit when this app not showing preview of my video which i am editing. wrost experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best editing app for smartphone. Easy to use and very user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Works better than the desktop version. Very intuitive and responsive. This was a fortunate find for my on the go video projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really Awesome, i highly recommend itüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use but powerful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Won't import video clips on my Pixel 5. Would love to be able to clip down short videos and save to my CC account, but nope. Doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"amazing, both for pc and mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Would not say its a perfect app, screen goes black during editing, i have purchased subscription, but dont think its worth it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please enable import from Google Photos and Pixel 4a 5G compatibility."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't pay for it! -1 star"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good app but super limited. Gets the basic job done."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and Easy instructions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Many audio issues"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't sign in, app busted"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very Nice App For Video Editing This App Is Help Me For Edit My Video I Suggest Everyone For Download This Wonderful App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app. You can edit profesonaly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant run the application vivo y15"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty easy to use, but don't expect to be able to render and output any videos. Just crashes. Free version errors out during rendering; paid version errors out during rendering. With time wasted editing with no output/end product, Adobe should pay me for my time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, much better obe out there including one that are free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Corrupted all of my projects. I can't change the clip volume because if I do it makes it very crackly. Need help."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic works great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"the video won't even play after cutting. not great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I am new to video editing and this app is amazing and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I was very disappointed by the fact that usually after aproximative 5 minutes it freezes portions of the exported video. I cancelled the subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Theres no option to reduce the quality of the preview showed while editing and that is probably the cause of it not working super glichy app and slow and the exported version has a lot of glitches (my phone is a one plus 7t with a 8gb ram and snap dragon 865 so my phone is not the problem)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I am able to edit while at the Gym. Can't beat that!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app üëå eva"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Auidio loops at random spots and videos delete themselves"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty dope so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seriously love it There is a learning curve to it but I'll keep on going"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just download the app and paid for a 4.99 subscription just for the app to crash everytime I try to create a video project. Regardless if it's 2 clips or 40 clips, the app crashes right after it prepares the media. Fix your app adobe, I though this was supposed to be quality and it's not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'll always prefer Premiere over this, but it's good for quick edits and small videos. **Update** If you're using the pixel 5 and cannot download this app, I'd reccommend you download the APK from a reputable source to continue editing videos on your Pixel 5"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's showing Blank screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Do not use This app has caused me hours of work to be lossed it is not worth your time do not download find something else that works better garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's rad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'm missing the ability to have more editing options. Particularly considering this is a paid app. For example with the format tool you can edit off the bottom of the video vertically but not from the top. Little things like that make a huge difference in creating a final product."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a handy little app for adding titles and transitions to videos. I use it a lot to stitch different clips together. It's very helpful to have on my Galaxy S8+ for producing up video segments on the go, when I am away from my laptop. There's a small learning curve but it isn't too hard to master. It comes with lots if different transitions and titles. Overall, I am impressed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No abi support."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need some additional capabilities"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice but I can't see my project video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I've got all the bells and whistles on my desktop for editing videos but it sure is handy having Rush on the phone for the quick phone Video edits. Works great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its good when it doesn't crash constantly :/"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The Rush app is slowly getting better and better. I think they are taking a long time to add new features but when the do, they are welcomed.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Dead simple, great quality!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great, but it would be better if there is audio transition feature, at least having a fade in/out feature"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best free editing software it does everything you want it to do to the millisecond. The only complaint I have is when you have a voice over their is lots of static in the background. Other than that, amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and Simple to use and no annoying watermarks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is so terrible. Audio glitches on playback and the app causes system UI crashes and freezes my phone. Totally unusable. I expected better from Adobe, what a shame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Worst experience app automatically close while rendering please fix this problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Do not download the app unless you want to pay 11$/month. It is NOT a FREE version its a TRIAL version. After 3 videos you WON'T be able to make any other video unless you pay a subscription. It's a great app but inaccurate information about the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app & user friendly also. But most of the simple sound effects are available in premium catagory only. Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Basic, but still good for very simple edits. I like that you can easily crop, resize, and rotate. I wish there were options to change clip's speed and direction."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing and videos are exported with a lot of errors."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and good quality always saves"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Realme 7 not working properly Video not showing editing time line"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is no use only make us fool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Grate aap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app was good at one point, now I can't use any of my adobe fonts, it glitches and restarts every 5-10 minutes (with minimal editing), and I cant export anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"for sure is one of the best free app for simple edditin, it is easy and fast! but sometimes I faced some problems and lost all the progress with the eddited video and had to start again"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really good app, it gets 4 stars due to lack of options. I wish we were able to do a little more with transitions and key framing. But it is super handy and easy-ish to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ottimo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sound is terrible getting crakely audio other apps are fine so definitely the app and not my video??????"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't see video on preview screen, it is all black"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is Very Helpful and Simple video editor But so many Bugs and Glich."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb start, very impressed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps stopping. I would like a credit for last month's service as I have not been able to use the app in a month."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic video editing from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"All great! But would be greater if you could provide just the reverse clip/ -100 speed option."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pixel 5 now compatible, thanks for adding it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Been really enjoying it so far made my first video with it and was very easy to use no restrictions yet (besides a few minor features)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I was very happy to see that the non premium version can do more than 3 exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Chopped of the beginning of my video and I didn't even edit that part. I edited out 6 seconds in the middle of the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good, but not as priemeire pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app! The interface is so simple and easy to use and it works flawlessly most of the time. Unfortunately it does lag a fair bit when you add cuts and transitions and I'm certain my phones processor can handle but I feel its something software related."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Even not smooth in samsung S20 phone I ü§î Adobe gona launch its own device for this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. A most have for content creators"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty easy and fast to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"For very small videos,it's good. Got oneplus7 pro and trying find few photos and videos. It's hanging my phone all the time. App is not even crashing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I really like this app but it is forever crashing if it did not crash so often I would give it 5 star I still use it as it is the best one but it is also the app that I swear the most at ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It would be nice to have a few more features on the free version. Lightroom has so much to offer already without paying for it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tati app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Imported audio is slowed down, tried new project clearing cache, reinstalling, all audio from Imported sourced is not at right speed even though tool bar show 100%"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app on mobile devices, no one can come close to this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cant play video in it i have only voice no video the screen is black pls fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"My favorite app.its the best"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It does a fair bit, but still annoying in ways."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app i always use it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tried to open the app but could not create project error showing simultaneously. And yes I am using a last year flagship phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just amazing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Smooth easy to learn"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent but have bugs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is an app with some really great potential when it works, but it has become so buggy, it is unusable. I already ran into problems with the app freezing or crashing regularly while working on projects. I also had issues with audio glitching regularly, even in the export version. The final straw was recently when Rush has now started distorting the audio on all my clips and music, making them lower pitched. This has unfortunately made the app unusable for me, even after a reinstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Controls are a bit finicky, and it would like to adjust the size of the video preview, but otherwise great app for quick edits."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I add music it slows it down and it doesn't play some of the parts when I'm trying to make an video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pedha boka Moda"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for editing when you get used to it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great video editor"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy and produce high quality result."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Also please add animation of like & subscribe button for free ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A dismal Effort, I'm using a Oneplus 7t, a highly specd phone. Often in timeline the play feature stops working, I spent 3 hours restarting the app to create a video and on rendering voice was out of sync and video choppy. I wasted a 1 month subscription and 3+ hours of my time. Do not recommend"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The video editing is great and super convenient. However the audio is terrible for adding music or doing voice over. It crackles!! I had this service over a year ago and canceled just because of that issue. And here i am a year later, back, still the same problem with this app. Smh."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Continual poor performance. Frequently hangs and locks up device."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app. Only feature I wish they would add is reverse video (boomerang)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Hello I have a problem with the app! When I open any file, even the totorial files. I only see black.. Please respond soon..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Just stick to making Windows softwares if all you can manage is a buggy and terrible android application. It literally wasted hours of my life and still hasn't rendered one video properly. Don't use it, it sucks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful for being a free app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"One of the best in the market without watermark üëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wast it has many bug"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Heads up for Android users, it wasn't working/loading until I Rolled back the updates for Android Webview. (Go to Settings, Apps, Webview, and tap the 3 dots to undo updates)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Would not open"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I think the app is decent. I've got the paid subscription and had some issues with customer service. They wanted me to jump through hoops to solve my issue and aint nobody got time for that. I expected better I guess. The app has some glitches when trying to download to YouTube. I usually have to wait several hours to post once my videos are rendered. It won't always open my current project either. I just tap 10-15 times on my project before it opens. All in all it's an OK app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's amazing when it works! But unfortunately this app only works about 50% of the time. Today, I tried to make a video and the color is totally desaturated. Very frustrating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A great app overall, has everything you need to edit videos, except it bugs out and crashes all the time. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get it to even to open up."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I loved this app a few months ago. Now it won't even play my video without the visual and audio skipping like crazy. I can't work on anything because I can't tell what is going on ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app to do editing on ü§ôüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is my first time using the app. It seems quite easy and basic even for the beginners."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Cannot import HEVC format from Google Cam, disappointing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"it amaizing app for video editing like a professional video but i small bug in pause video but it's not a big bug it's very nominal bug 10 out of 10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just wanted to mix 2 clips together, first one was 5 mb and other one 4 mb. Without doing any extra job or any effect, minimum size for the final output was 46 mb !?!?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Za Best üëç‚òùÔ∏èüîù"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Overall the app is a great editing experience with terrible flaws. It has many glitches including random audio cuts and app just freezing sometimes and it doesn't have as many features as other editing apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for video editing on the phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's obviously not as good as Premiere Pro but as far as phone video editing apps, it's pretty great. Love being able to speed up video while maintaining pitch."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well for video serious video editing on a mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"nice logo . but total waste app."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent mobile app for video editing!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It work very good for a while then everything get glitchy then it stops working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app was good for a while but then I started realizing the glitches were ruining all my projects, the audio glitches are constant and make this app so difficult to work with. Please fix all the glitches, thank you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A great tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing tool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I tried over five app, this is the best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app chopped up the background music for no apparent reason, leaving some 1 second sections to play twice, while others were skipped. Any video you create with this with music in the background will be completely unusable. Reason for 2 stars is that it was easy to learn and worked fine creating silent videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Solid 4 outta five, only if it wasn't buggy haha, or laggy i guess, its still great, I loved itüíØ‚ù§‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I don't what just happened, it was my issue or a technical bug i freaking don't know but nothing was being displayed on the preview screen and made me disappointed. üò∂‚òπÔ∏è"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app very easy to edit and this is the best user friendly app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Another great Adobe app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I pay for an Adobe subscription that says it includes premiere rush and storage on creative cloud. But it wants me to pay extra each month for features in rush like syncing my projects. Given how buggy this app is, don't ever pay Adobe to use it. Just buy a better app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor I have used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Honestly,, its great. I've been using it as my go-to editor..there's alot of bugs holding me back from going premium but i hope they manage them soon,, been seeing improvements as well,, so im hopeful they see the room for improvement."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I love using it. Rendering is an issue. Sometimes it works and sometimes not. Still a fan however ü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Free to use.. No watermark.. The perfect app for extreme budget video editors/video creators"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Im trying to export a file and continuously it fails , one in 50 times the files get actually exported"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app freezes waaaaay too much. Definitely not worth paying for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I am a premiere pro user. I expected rush to do more."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have downloaded it for the fifth time and the display screen is blank and I am not able to seen the video I am editing.....and I have tried logging in with different account but it doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very slow and video's dont always render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for mobile video editing. Producing content ont he go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to render.. sad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad apps dont Download."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Smooth, intuitive, lots of functions for free app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's crashing.. please fix. Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So much of bugss in this app waste pls fix this issue and release this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App!!!!! :D"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've used this app on and off over the years. After all these years despite the buggy and laggy it can be it finally allows me to export me videos for free. Unfortunately the new update messes my audio up making the video audio really bad. Now it has crashed and I can no longer use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really helps pretty well to edit videos if you are a beginner"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"app experience is Good , as it is a mobile app it lags some features which increases more productivity but for normal editing it is fine."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Unfortunately, it has too many glitches. I was hoping to work seamlessly between my computer and my phone, but it syncs super slow. Also it renders terribly on my phone for playback making editing difficult and inaccurate. I like the interface and the music options, but they have to make it work better. For a company that can build editing software like Premier Pro, I don't get why Rush is so defective and mediocre. For the steep price I pay every year, hopefully they fix it soon."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Total paid aps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not user friendly at all. Hard to figure out how to clip a long file down. Unfortunately I pay a subscription to use these apps and they all seem to be hard to use or are incomplete in needs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just did more in 1 hour than I ever dreamed. This may save a business. Thank you!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelent!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Exported video's jitter, no matter the quality settings. avoid."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I want to be positive but I'm literally editing and my sound cuts out How can I edit without sound? This app is killing me right now!! üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app has many bugs. Whenever I use any pictures or video for editing. It's showing black screen. I tried 4th time but always wasted me time or data. My request to anyone don't waste your time to install this worst app of Adobe . Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Compared to other apps when it comes to trimming, Adobe premiere rush maintains 60 fps quality if available. I tried like 7 others before this app solved my problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not process projects. Gets to 90 percent then errors. Unusable until fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing , love it‚ù§ü•∞"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best editing app. User friendly. Top quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Love the app except for the sound can be real sensitive. When you try to adjust volume levels and add music it sounds terrible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm on a pixel 3. I spent an hour on two occasions making a video for my kids. Both times, the software had glitches, screwing up the audio from the video. I'm not wasting any more time. This is very buggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Wow! I'm really surprised by this app capabilities, kudos to Adobe! So far the only feature I'm missing is resizing (changing the resolution) the videos. Otherwise, great job!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'd like s refund please: the preview is black 50% of the time and the other 50% it's lagging. Also the texts are beautiful but they're so difficult to edit because the preview is so tiny I can't pick what I want to edit. Such a shame these problems make this app unusable because it had good potential... I bought the app because I generally trust Adobe... But this is not a funcional app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Luego de renderizar el v√≠deo se traba constantemente"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's pretty much unusable. All settings go unsaved after setting them up for a video you can't even preview. Do not recommend for lower end devices"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"epic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Stable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and play!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love this app but this need to be for devices 6.0+ bc my bro wants it and he doesn't have it. So if u guys don't do that I will give u guys a 1 star! Thx."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very clean, very easy to use, very useful. As always thank you adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great for basic editing on your phone. A few effects could be added to make it so I don't have to transfer clips to my computer to finish the edits but it's still good for a free mobile editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"As it says its rushed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Does what it says. Editing high res videos with speed and clarity visually and sonically. Easy u.i. to figure out. I'd like to see better text options and themes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mini primer. Works good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sooo buggy... Projects screen hangs most of the time and seems to take several minutes before it becomes responsive. Editi ng is the highlight as it seems to work pretty well. Rendering is hit or miss on whether it works... It will often hang mid-render or generate corrupted files that dont play properly. It's been this way for the past several years so I wonder if anyone at Adobe is paying attention to this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app just gets stuck at Turtorial screen. Who needs splash screen or turtorial. When you need to simply join two videos quickly unreliable app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's alright. I use it on android and it's inconsistent half the time the clip just freezes and I gotta restart takes way longer then it should due to this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app smooth slowmo ya nice üôÇ I rate this app 5 stars ü§© and I have purchased it so more effecient. Wow thanx"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App. Just a need Master Volume for Audio Track (like on Pre Pro). Otherwise its pretty perfect. Thank you to all behind this app. Much love. God bless you all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I would leave zero stars if I could. This app is tragically awful in its execution. It is incredibly difficult and unintuitive to use, with choppy, terrible transformation controls, absolutely disgusting audio encoding and a whole host of other issues. I've professionally edited videos for 8 years and I can't think of a worse product I've used. I'd seriously recommend Windows Movie Maker over this. Do yourself a favour and find something else. A waste of time and space on your phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible. App keeps crashing durring rendering. Waste of my time üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Nothing but problems. Choppy audio. Frozen frames... Now I can't even export!! Terrible. Billion dollar company, can't figure out an app. I know guys who has 10 dollars to their name create much better apps. Shame on you Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"There are a lot bugs regarding this app, although it's still very reliable to use. Video freeze after several cuts or effects = it simply freezes or takes a very long time than usual to play clips consuming a lot of time than it really should Eg. Playing the video typically takes .5 seconds but for freeze it plays after 5-12 seconds = There are other edit bugs but they are removed after the rendering, it's fine but can really make it difficult to edit tricky bits Please try & overview the bugs"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Save yourself from headache, use youcut , filmora or kinemaster instead. Why? (Im using s10) 1. Bugs 2. Need to pay to render 4k (i would) 3. Audio..üò§ 4. Audio & vid are out of sync after render most of the time, but not during post work. 5. Glitch after render. How to get rid of this? Redo it multiple times. 6. Slider (no option to type in the number) 7. Fix the transform option 7. Why would I pay for the premium when all the above keep happening? (I can't believe this app made by Adobe)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Keren"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Brilliant features love it. I make my Instagram art reels on here much easier"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for quick video editing. I just dnt wanna edit all video in laptop and this app is perfect for my phone editing jobs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Way better than what I'm getting with my resident Android App. I'm not a professional but I really like it and found it easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i spent hours making a video that I can't download and it won't even play when I try to screen record it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio glitches after exporting. The transitions between clips is also not right. I am unable to import some media and it doesn't say why? I love using the app, it is very user friendly but I don't get a good final product. Thos problem is still not fixes after the latest update and Adobe does not respond to reviews."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it! It's my go to for creating social media videos and other creative projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Ok but not great most of good features are missing and most of are paid"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Preview not working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is so buggy. I was frustrated almost to tears. It crashed my computer and phone multiple times. I had to give up and just export my work and finish editing my 1 minute video on InShot. Adding a simple caption is ridiculously difficult, without it having some goofy animation to it. Ill be happy to use it when its better, but for now its awful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome üòé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My phone crashed the other day out of the blue. I had no function of my phone, so I was forced to do a factory restart. But luckily I backed all my files and photos 2 days before this happened. And I googled what could be the cause of this, and it states that one of the causes could be due to a third party app. And this app was the only app I have recently downloaded. So when I was able to restore everything. I quickly uninstall this app. And since then no problems at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's a little finicky. Trying to edit anything takes a very precise finger. Fonts don't load well, either. If you add fonts from the desktop they will sync, from the phone -not so much."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The editing and UI are fine. It is easy to edit things, import clips, adjust speed, trim clips, adjust volume, etc. It seemed like audio got worse after bringing it into the app, but that could just be the preview, not the finished project. HOWEVER, there is one major issue. You can't export the videos. I have tried to upload these videos to Adobe Creative Cloud, to YouTube, and directly to my phone. The only export options you are given are to several social media apps, none of which work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app may have SINGLEHANDEDLY destroyed my vlogging career. It wouldn't render a project without MASSIVE glitches, so I decided to get a new phone. I RE-DID the ENTIRE project on my new phone & it had the EXACT same problem. I'm glad I pay $50 a month for the PS Suite so that this garbage app can jerk me around. I get to lose my audience, have to re-do this project a THIRD time AND learn an new editing program, but at least I spent a fortune on a new phone I didn't need... You had ONE JOB!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app needs improvements like LITERALLY!!! The app is pretty laggy which is annoying this is the only editing app in my phone that lags and when I edit something the image/video doesn't shows up the screen it does play music but the video doesn't appear ü§¶"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really great was made good improvements"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can't use any of the features such as speeding up clips or slowing them down which makes the app basically useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"But.... can't rendering!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've used this app before without issues, but I guess it must've updated recently and now it's buggy. The audio is not properly synced up with the video and it also lags, meaning it's as though the audio is playing at a slower rate than the video, to the extent it even lowered the vocal pitch. I'm an adobe subscriber so it'd be nice to be able to use this but it really needs work..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good for transforming gifs into videos for Instagram"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"We'll, I'd love to use this app because I'm a subscriber of Creative Cloud, but it's not usable. The most important feature -- cutting, is not working properly! It lags and deletes chunks of the footage randomly. The playback stops working randomly. The volume histogram doesn't show randomly when scaling. I'm sorry that I have to leave a bad review! But I'm forced to find another app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not video showing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worked solid for a couple of weeks. Now I can't edit or playback videos without undearable audio glitching and freezing playback."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple without all of the extra gimmicky features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"For some reason the voice over quality on this app really sucks. Also the app crashes quite frequently and needs to be completely closed and reopened to work again. Videos start to lag at the end and I haven't figured out a way to fix itüò•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What's the hell video screen is showing black always"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love this app but would love it even more if it were available on my Samsung Tab S8 so I can sync and edit on a bigger screen on the go! I bought the tablet for that reason, assuming it would be available...but it's not."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I use it for editing and it works beautifully!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"l lovet"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fun"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's too slow for my phone. When making a video that's not even a full minute long it lags. I have a high end phone but still."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Osaam"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really good and user-friendly.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good pc type"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Disappointing for and Adobe product. No matter what I did I couldn't adjust the sound without the sound being corrupted. There are no sound fade in and out options and no video stabilizer. What!?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it is a waste to use it asking 2565 fees to export the video please don't download this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App is good but bad for master.... Aap iss too slow ü¶•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I would have given it 5 stars bit now what ever update you gave to this app is causing it to do trash. 1080p 60fps renders are freezing. It doesn't even render the entire video. I paid for the subscription and after this I unsubscribed. This is so frustrating. Fix this please."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why can't I export video?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have Installed this on my device. And it sucks.... The video is not visible only the audio track is playing and I have uninstalled and reinstalled more times and same continuing over time.... Please fix this problem otherwise this app is awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Totally not very good app,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very Good Experience With This App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adds a very slight amount of distortion into audio. Makes louder deep sounds take over quieter deep sounds and can completely destroy vocals in songs with loud drums. Basically unusable for what I'm using it for. UI is pretty alright compared to the other apps in the store."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Notably promising with lots of seriously cool features, but unfortunately to buggy to use. Just navigating around the UI things were unresponsive, opened the wrong place and so on. Really hope it'll get better though bc damn the features in here"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Needs works. Not being able to change clips in the time line..adjusting the position of the clip is frustrating. I finally just took the video clip off and booted my computer and used premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Does what i need it to do and then some"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"VERSATILE!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm glad to finally have it on my Samsung S20! Took long enough but I am very happy now that it's here"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app but some times it gives problem deleting audio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Works, but not without flaws. UI isn't too intuitive for a smartphone, and there are other apps which are more limited but simpler to use to good effect."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"omg, the sounds really terrible... before this, it's really nice. after update, the sounds broken."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Intuitive and well functioning. Would be 5 star but it's missing a few extra effects that would be nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When I open the app and select the file the screen come black"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's simple and easy to use. Very intuitive. Love being able to edit videos on the fly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sublime"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its running better on my note 20 uktra but it kept on crashing on my pixel 3 and samsung s8"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Please fix this app...it's exporting process won't work properly with videos that are more than 20 minutes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't export my video, app keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Muito bom, eu dou in√≠cio na edi√ß√£o pelo smartphone e termino no desktop, deixa a desejar quando tento fazer um v√≠deo inteiro no smartphone s√≥ que n√£o tem como eu colocar uma m√∫sica que est√° no meu aparelho, tenho que mandar pro cc, muita burocracia, uma coisa simples que economizaria tempo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing aap I love Adobe ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Would be great if it wasn't so glitchy. I was using samsung s9+ Tried to purchase so I can finnish on desktop and was not syncing and purchased was not valid on desktop. Why is syncing even advertised if it does not work! I was never able to speek to customer service so I ended up downloading another editing sofware and had to start from zero. üëéüèº"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just make it a bit better for mobile, everything is good but could be better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"There is a problem with audio. Please fix that Adobe. It's like when I import a video and start playing it the audio gets 0.25x slower. Please fix that Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing on the fly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just horrible. In Samsung S8 the video monitor freezes at a standstill while the audio and timeline continue to play. This makes it impossible to use. I expected more from an Adobe in product."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love it just wish you could add music from your device on the free version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Beware all who have auto update turned on. At least for this app, TURN IT OFF! It mercs your projects like none other wherever the littlest thing happens. I have to put my phone in airplane mode to export, the sound is incredibly quiet for the preview, the colors aren't accurate to the exported project, and now the app auto update and it makes ALL the audio sound like it's peaking."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Junk. Was a pain before with glitches and bad audio, choppy edits but now more than half of the time its having to restart or it crashes. Smelly garbage is a better investment since at least you can see what you're actually working with. If you can't make an app that works then don't with the subscription service model this is ridiculous especially for such a heavy in the industry. The whole big bizz not playing together is old as my Samsung tab s6 is worse than my note 8 (and not supported)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for quick gopro and dji drone editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely unfriendly user interface, missing a lot of features available in free apps. This app is WIP, I'd say early alpha. Not sure why Adobe thinks it's worth paying for it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Speed ramping is not useful as it should be. Go for VN friends."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Downgrades video quality and video flickers after rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent mobile video editor!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app worked for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app; Love the video flip"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Was using PowerDirector for awhile *doesn't suck*, but the features on here blew my mind and making the adjustments to editing my videos is alot smoother"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesnt want you to export your work Just some money app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I keep coming back to Adobe Rush thinking ""it can't be that bad"". But it really is. 1. You cannot easily delete a video clip you have just captured. If you are like me, you have to do multiple takes until you get it just right. In other apps, it's EASY to delete the clip you just captured, and try again. NOT ON ADOBE RUSH. You have to go to your file manager, find the damn files and delete them manually. 2. The responsiveness can be RIDICULOUSLY slow. Totally unacceptable. Not worth 1 star."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"confusing as heck it doesn't make like any sense it doesn't have a very good tutorial and plus half the time it makes you zoom out when you're just trying to put photos over your video. it still works but it's more of a work in progress they need to help design this at better and make it more user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app continues to get worse, video files does not show up, the video/cropping is janky and the navigation for the files is a nightmare. I'm gonna have to uninstall this app because it's completely broken, you're better than this adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Poor. System crashed projects won't export. I uninstalled and reinstalled to try to help now I don't have access to the premier tools that I paid for. I sent an error report and heard nothing back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad apps cannot run well in s21"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best ever experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Would have more star if it would support newer phone like a samsung s20 that as been out for 1 year now.... same for note 20.... doesnt work. Adobe support minus zero star for scripted answer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Idont find music for kids videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Poor performance, freezing, and unusable for anything other than the most basic editing tasks. OnePlus 7T"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Massive rendering issues and even playback! On Powerful Note 10 plus and a user of Premier. 7 minute clip with 5 videos and 10 pics and several transitions, 2 overlays and some colour filters. ü§ìüò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, best mobile video editing software I've used so far."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app no longer works (and it was barely good even when it did). I select the files for import and it just shows them being loaded and then.... Nothing. Trying to import them again leads to an error message. Totally useless!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great easy basic tool to use & edit videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best ever app everyone is not saying right because the video exports but takes time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app ever found I tried many editing software but it's the best and I use it free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't want you farming any of my PRIVATE information like what browser I use on what device ETC. you do not need that to edit a video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash, it can't find media and it can't brows for media too. Not worth paying for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not bad not so good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The cloud sync is not working on my new project. Another device can see the project but doesn't have any of the media. It says to wait for upload to complete, but it never does."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Decent Basic app. Does a nice job on what it can do but: 1. A clip cannot be reversed. Forward only at whatever speed you want. 2. Does not support Galaxy Tab S4. I was getting ready to purchase, but then discovered these fatal flaws."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just awesome and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App crashes when using speed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Intuitive but with an audio issue. Every audio background chosen from the library comes with a noise, so it's definetely not possible to add it tho the project. And at least for me, this is a necessary feature."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have Samsung Galaxy Note8 (android version 9 & security patch & software are both up to date). Just installed Rush, I tried adding 4-5 less than 30 sec video clips from my phone to the app to start a project. As it was ""preparing media"" it froze then completely crashed my phone & restarted my device. Usually apps that have bugs crash the app & has a pop up asking if I want to send feedback to the developers, but my device crashed not just the app. Please fix this issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Glitch occurs while playing the video...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is comple garbage. I could not export a single project. Some audio playback stops and you have to restart the app and finally if you try to export it crashes. Wonder who would buy the pro version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, it's easy to use. Good for on the go editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app for video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not support HDR fottage at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps on crushing. Grrrrr!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Playback is having lots of glitches."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Went from a potentially enjoyable experience to buggy and frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Utterly useless If it wasn't in a package deal I'd cancel rush in a heartbeat. Add a video to a new creation and it just disappears. I wish I could post a video clip of it happening."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Heavy for mobile phone. Better edit on adobe premiere on computer. Way better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Usability is great just crashes every now and then"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible...This app was good but lately it's been having alot of glitches. The video & audio is out of sync freezing and making a crackling sound. I'm paying for something I can't even use & I'm upset about that! Reached out to Adobe and NOTHING! Please fix I'm unable to upload my content"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very friendly, congrats"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Lots of great editing features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"King of the bakwas"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's option are free very professional and neat."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"everytime I try to edit my video, only the audio that appeared, no image"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why i can't see the video when i edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very good app for the most part. The app works flawlessly when it wants to however, I find myself having to close and restart whenever I want to get started on a new project. Also, it would be great if it contained the ability to blur/track objects. This app definitely needs to be improved before I update my rating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app for video editing!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't download it. Freezes. Useless. Please update."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have galaxy s10 plus and it didn't work on my phone -_-"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"*DO NOT PAY MONEY FOR THIS* I've been in back and forth with Adobe and Google on getting a $35 refund for this non-functional app and they both keep telling me they can't do anything, and to contact the other. I love the app, it's a nice editor for simple video tasks... if it would work. It messes up whenever I export anything beyond 10 minutes in length. It'll say ""successfully exported"" but when you play it back, the video freezes and is glitchy, usually around the 10 minute mark."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"WON'T ALLOW ME TO EXPORT WHAT THE HELL"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Decent app. Recently every edit after export, file is complete trash even tho it take 42 mins to finalize and export. Wait all that time then go to play the file and its trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good editing app. Please add some more transition effects and search option for the video/audio by name"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My experience is bad with this application but looking forward for good updates on this application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Im kinda in between. On one side, it has helped me with my YT and is easy to use, but the other side is that its glitchy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Unbeliveably Good Please increase the android suported phones in your list. Fabulous app üëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I can edit anywhere, and plug into my computer and edit with ease using samsung dex. Totally recommend!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Dont get me wrong im a fan of Adobe. But this app crashes and freezes way to much, and improperly renders video. Using OnePlus 8T"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad üëé app this app turn off when we export video..... I never can give 5 star ‚≠ê in this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Full of glitches, I only give one star for being free."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing. THE editing app for Adobe Pros"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Using a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I use high performance mode and close all other apps but I still get frequent crashes, especially when doing any speed ramping and working with 4k clips. I also have issues with the export just stopping at 9%."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have Android 10 ..But when i select a video for Editing ..The video is Black Why ?? Any solution ?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"In theory a great app, but its barely functional. Doesn't open projects 75% of the time, Doesn't play when editing half the time, no sound in project half the time... very infuriating. And impossible to use if no sound and video Doesn't play. Adobe's prgrams get buggier by the day."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Reasonable edit quality and ease of use, add free too. but all good features needs payment. There are other free apps available which offers the Rush paid for features for free, which makes it difficult to give more than 4 star rating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Well, this is disappointing! I can't see the preview."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice on the go app..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sometimes it works damn awesome but sometimes I feel like destroying my device It will show exported correctly then the video would be completely blacked out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So I pay for adobe and I can't download this app on the words most advance and expensive phone? The galaxy note 20 Ultra. Fix this!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unstable. Loses assets during cloud synchronisation. Looses audio track synchronisation. Continuous crashes on Android and Windows"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It works. Premiere Pro on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super..... App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The playback is glitchy. The audio is scratchy and out of sync, but worst of all the videos won't export. I've spent countless hours of filming and editing all to be left with no product. Adobe please fix this immediately! My video upload schedule is completely messed up because of this. People pay a substantial amount of money for your apps for their business and it's been days with no response from your team about resolving this issue. A video app that does not generate videos? Unprofessional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It opens but whenever I import any video it just shows black screen and only audio comes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If I could give negative stars I would. At first the app was amazing but now all audio becomes blown out and distorted and final products became choppy. Save your time and money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The app gets my job done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"User friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Changed the way I edit videos on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Too laggy on my Galaxy S10+, and after I export a video and watch it, some audio was missing. Hope the Adobe team will improve the app soon."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Veryyyyy slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just like every other Adobe software.....it just crashes, haven't been able to export one video yet"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it takes 5 hr to rendering 10-15 min video an due to some errer randoring is closs automatically again and again. it litrally takes 2 day only in rendering. you have to on screen and wait up to hrs and hrs if you want rendering in first atempt. terreble expirience üò≠üò≠"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video is not visible only black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"is there any way this app can be updated to work on newer versions of Android devices. I'm having to go back to my old Pixel 2 to continue using it and RAM and processing power are just not the same anymore. I don't want to switch to a competitor because I think the app is awesome but I'm using a Galaxy tab s6 and the LG wing and this app is not available on both of those devices."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful and very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"You need to add galaxy 21plus. Sucks with my new phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Totaly useless. All projects are loading, it doesnt let me create other one, just shut down this app, and anyome else - do not download this peace of garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Media does not import and the clips that were given are playing as black"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bought premium - no support for Arabic. There are 430 million arabic speaking people around the world. More than US population. Why don't you support Arabic language. I paid and upgraded for nothing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Noice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Crashes. When i upload videos to edit, my phone restarts. Then when i finally upload and edit, i get a production error message. Not good. Looking for something else."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until recently. The sound and voiceover is a mess now. It sounds like it's crackling all the time or warped."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pay a lot of money for a poorly designed app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best editing app but the thing which I don't like is premium thing like most of the things are premium but otherwise it's a very good app for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Please fix the Arabic titles its not working properly !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disgusting app. Don't install it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seems legit so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not export videos after rendering. The file just disappears. You can't even preview it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great tool for content creation"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ok yes ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Graphic glitch and last update was horrible, I'm using note 10+ and still this thing after last update giving some dropping in Fram and all, One request just bring back that last version used to before this update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cannot export my 4k video... I paid for premium and it always says error at the end lf waiting for so long..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's like having a slow Ferrari. All the gadgets and no follow through.. My first app review I'm my entire life. Made me want to shatter my phone. Gives you just enough to want to use it, but won't stop glitching files. Can't wait to change my review ADOBE. If fixed, could be something great. For now, I couldn't give a zero."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always failed to export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than kinemaster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can upload file or media but it shows black screen every single time üëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it! Easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A simple task like removing video audio will distort your video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good for short videos but you can't add Long videos like streams and stuff so it's difficult to make vods, etc overall good for small things like tiktoks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not working on my realme 7 phone please üôè can solve this issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I really tried and it's very very frustrating to use. Specially if you want to reframe a clip. There are many other apps that have many other more powerful effects and tools. This is just upsetting even if I'm a big fan of Premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Op ch,,,,tiya"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to import 360 photos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very very very good app for youtube"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT üíò"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to edit üòÉ I love this App ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It starts out good but gradually there's more and more problems every day. I've had to reinstall 39 times because it kept bugging out."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice App"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"There are so many glitches this app encounters."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Everything is better than kinemaster except the export resolution is so bad. 480p video 22sec had to converted to 720p with 14mb? It's 22sec ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Does the job well. Only wish is transitions seem to apply to all cuts rather than one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Low quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best there is"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just installed it and had to uninstall right away, its so glitchy didnt even get the chance to edit properly. Glitched right from the very beginning"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This program crashes my phone when I'm trying to render my videos, very annoying please look in to this immediately. Not a satisfied customer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horribly laggy and non responsive such that just 2 minutes into simple edits, it'll just stop playing the video altogether."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing app however there is a big problem the playback screen is always black and is not working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's absolutely amazing üëèüòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was working great, now voiceover keeps getting worse and worse. Every voice over sounds crackly and the video is jerky during playback, now I also cant export a video that's over 20 minutes, the whole video will render, but during export all of the videos stop at 20 minutes and I lose whatever was after. This sucks since I pay 10.00 a month for this, it should work better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing when I upload a video. Im a film student and used to like this app even though it had problems now it doesn't even work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video fails to edit in Android 10 with an 8GB Ram, stupid app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very weak video editor. ... Simples looses the name of adobe...Not even close to the pc version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My videos are coming out pixelated and missing frames. No support at all from developer. The email they provide doesn't even go to a human being."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I add Audio to a video the audio speed changes automatically to a lower key it is so annoying the audio sounds nothing like what I uploaded serious disappointment"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't even let import audio files. Nothing better than a video trimming app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need easier way to get plugins and more audio options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Few controls make this app mostly useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I can't reverse the video ? You kidding me üò≥üò≥üò≥ .. such a great app but they don't have this normal function .. poor tech options :/"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Useful until it's not. Extremely user-friendly, and you can connect to the cloud to access your videos on any device. But the app crashes, the audio becomes warped or disappears entirely, and the rendering is terrible. So while you get great editing tools, adding audio and actually getting the video exported somewhere is awful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Apparently no longer compatible with my Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 or my Galaxy Tab S7, both of which running Android 11? Get it sorted, please!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Likely Premiere but simple"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing product, I love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Damn that is good and fast. Adobe never disappointed me anyway... ü§ü"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great on my Samsung Note 9. Just got my new Galaxy S21 Ultra in the mail today so it should work even better (faster) on that one!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app , always update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing program, but since the last update, any exported video fails 20 min in. I used it in the past to seem together long videos recorded on my phone that get saved in segments. Never had any issues before and love the tools and navigation, but now the end product is rendered useless. So whatever happened in the last update completely destroyed the usefulness of this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great Work Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need to try full app to rate 5 stars"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Would have gave it 5 stars but I want to be able to write on the picture I upload."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"In one word just bad editor. Whenever I edit a video it always end up laggy and choppy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best mobile videos editor I've used. But that's not exactly a high bar. As long as this stops suggesting automatic cropping and stuff like that, and let's you chose some other aspect ratios than 16:9, 1:1 and the tall Instagram one, it'll be great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mind blowing superb febules"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like it. Does what other mobile apps don't"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Saving videos with media uploaded from the camera of my phone is so glitchy. Terrible software. Doesn't save the video FULLY. Only 30-80% of the video is actually there. Using Samsung FE"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't allow you to pull footage from.sd card"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Ill give this a three because its a really good bideo editor but i try to load a video that was downloaded and it says failed to load so can u guys fix that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is really nice for on the go when you need to edit. As for me I'm a Youtuber :p"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"You guys are geniuses. It's amazing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I've given up on many projects thanks to this app. Not only is the noise messed up, but it will randomly freeze your phone and force you to restart."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Realtime preview did not work at all in samsung s10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Premiere rush? More light Premiere GLITCH. Every time I create a project it works the first time and then when I go to add new media later I can't get the damn project to synchronize. I prepaid for an entire year and I just spent seven hours, seven damn hours and still can't get the stupid thing to synchronize so I can finish editing it! TBH I want my money back or my year of prepayment to cover premiere pro instead."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice, like it üëçeasy to use friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Hope in future 4k options is open for rendering and glitch effects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I expected a lot more from Adobe, especially for the amount they charge to subscribe to use their software. An absolute steaming turd of an app, if I could give minus stars, I would! Avoid at all costs!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When it say rush but clicking the text is hard i must forward a bit and be edit again ilove adobe but this makes me waste some time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app full of problems üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First initial download and use had been super smooth so far! Hopefully the upload is niceüëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editor shows black screen instead of video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Recently been failed to export while 50 min vid only show the first 20 min"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad and didnot work goodly also lose lot of mb. I think it should be offline"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Almost similar to premiere Pro. Just that still less convenient compared to the premiere pro. Recommended for everyone!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I gave 5 stars when I first used it, but now I am giving 3. At first, it was the best app for editing my vlogs and videos. Now, I add an intro that I created in another app, and the app freezes, crashes, and has to restart. Spent 2 hours trying to find out what the heck it keeps doing this. It's looks are good, but it needs to be able to handle the load."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"this app sucks so hard for appearing like it's a quality product, but can barely function at simple tasks. it's ridiculous that they push you to buy into the premium features when it's so buggy in the first place."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Does not support Arabic."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Soo complicated to edit videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app used to be amazing, with the power to limitlessly edit my videos at the expense of my phone's battery, but the day part is that those days are no more, and it has become nearly impossible to use, with such long loading times that it no longer works."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad experience, app freezes once I add audio. Can't do basic editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever üòíüòíüòíüòíüòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Trust me the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Still having issues with crackling audio when trying to record voice overs on Samsung"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Reduce Timewaste"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Video preview blank"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Started out great, then all of a sudden my videos after I extract them and put in gallery they start getting choppy between 6 and 8min into video tried several different videos from different dates and no luck. Even Uninstalled and installed again. No luck. Not with the money"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Oh my goodness, I have the best editing app to work with, it's a great experience and so easy to work inside this app for photo's and video's, I have fun now when I am trying edit a video instead of getting frustrated a lot. I love Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This the best editing video app ever! Here I can find most of the resources that I can find on the Desktop application."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Reported issues with audio and glitches many times but still hasn't been fixed. I pay for the app, and it seems to get worse everytimr I use it. Everytime I want to edit something another issues arises that requires me to choose another video editor. Uninstalling"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"He is best app for Android video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Need my money back!!!! This app won't export videos, they all skip and have frame rate issues, terrible app, the subscription is 5 dollars for an app that does absolutely nothing positive!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"As soon as I edit audio the video starts making crackling noises, takes forever to render, is not usable. Looks like it would be great if this was fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for video's editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pathetic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened to this app but whatever problems it has are also present on the desktop version, constantly freezing and crashing, too much time wasted trying both versions cause I needed to finish a project, at the end had to use another software."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great solfware"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app . Them I realized you can put your own music in the background ‚úäüèæ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Issue after Issue. Audio is funky when you edit, when you finally finished with editing, it doesn't even render the entire video and it chops everything up. Finally, it WILL NOT load to YouTube. Adobe's always been my go to, but this is a huge disappointment for me."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I never write reviews but to save you the trouble I thought I'd communicate this. This is the WORST app ever (atleast for Android) you will spend HOURS editing just to find out that your content will not download properly, it'll either download very glitchy, or a text will be missing, its absolutely horrendous even if you pay for premiere which is what I have. Dont waste your precious time please! You have been warned. If I could give this 0 stars I would."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I take the vedio from the gallary but vedio is not coming only audio is coming . Please fix it soon"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and familiar to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to quick edit content for social media üëè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a great tool for editing videos. My only issue is that the video will stop playing after making a few edits. I'm not sure what the issue is, but I have to close the app in order to start editing again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I normally edit with either Adobe Premier Pro or Final Cut Pro and this app is more than what I expected. Very easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love how easy and fast it is to make videos!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Id much rather be able to use this on my galaxy tab s7 plus"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Full of bugs idk what to say! üò°üò°üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely awesome, the most professional and advanced video editing software for mobile, HANDS DOWN! Everything you could need at your fingertips."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice its like adobe premiere. I have upgraded but still can't use the premium version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't even edit a single clip because it's all black. Nothing to show!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stupid apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video not show"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Make my audio low pitch, Solve this video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I understand the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please don't use . It is the worst app I have used ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's a waste of time! It used to work but was complicated to use. Now it doesn't work at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Please add reverse and green screen. Also I am waiting for the note 20 app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am having issue while rendering..I tried so many times to render the video but after 90% it automatically cancle.... frustrated because this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Maybe this app just isn't fully compatible with the Galaxy 10+. I can never just edit a video, I have to restart the app, I have issues with the audio, the videos freeze. Amazing on my laptop, but I would think Adobe would have a better performing product for the mobile app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Dope"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I am a regular user of Adobe premiere cc and was excited to try this portable app, the app is great more features can be expected in future the only problem for me is when I try to edit a little heavy video it freezes alot."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Need more features like color filters, new effects and transforms and audio quality adjustments"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need to add a reverse speed function in the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why the hell it's not available for my OnePlus 8 pro while I'm using it in a OnePlus 6"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Extremely buggy. Playback is laggy and I don't know why. Sometimes has loads of visible glitches on my videos when playing back or saving"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Used it once, did the job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is kind of buggy if you do the trial version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App is meh. Exporting on my Samsung s20 Ultra doesn't come out so good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am a regular user of Premiere Pro CC and was excited to have a portable app that was even a fraction of the full size program. The UI is solid and once u learn to navigate, it's pretty functional with decent options. But when I perform simple operations like resize the video for diff platform formats, the video goes crazy with movements! Have also had issues with the audio after inport. Ugh... With how much I pay for Adobe CC, I was hoping this would be a winner, but it just falls short rn"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Nice works good, great product considering its free, but why can't I edit a video thats 21:9 or other aspect ratios?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app would be great if it didn't crash every 2 minutes. Very good quality editing tools. Awful it doesn't stay running long."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"User friendly and easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rending has become very very slow. So it has become impossible for me to upload my video. It is very annoying."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing when I export the videos......what I did is putting together some mp4 files and adding a few effects......"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app, needs keyframes and reverse"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This ""APP"" is COMPLETELY unusable, period. No beating around the bush. Just to put already pre cut clips together is a HASSLE it crashes CONSTANTLY and some days it just doesn't even work when you open it. Get it together."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stupidest video editing application ever made."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm a beginner in video capturing and editing, but this app feels simple and more or less easy to use. I'm really impressed with the quality of the video capture by default. The only problem I have is that focus lock doesn't work. As soon as I press record button the focus goes back to auto (or maybe default value). Please, fix the focus lock issue. Thank you!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome yet simple"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bom"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pranoy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good appüòÅüëçi really enjoyed this app for edit and rendering my youtube videos :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app is fine, but includes consistent bugs. Many times it takes a while for project selection to respond, or you need to update projects before selecting. Often audio is not in sync or will skip during production if edited too quickly. Videos can yield the same issues, especially if working with higher quality videos. Exporting can halt and seems finicky as well. This app works, but these issues should be fixed for it to actually be worth the $9.99/month..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing and free and easy to use"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot use rush to edit photos from my phone on my surface pro.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't get this app to work properly. The sync function is not working. Created a video on my pixel then synced everything and on my pc or mac it doesn't restore all the media. Plus on all platform it can't export the project with 4k content."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect! üíØ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best solution after comparing filmorago and quik. Not as cut and paste as other programs but appreciate the flexibility and functionality of the available features to do some quality editing on my pixel 2 without exporting to a different device and taking too much time. Great job!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i need refund its not helpful so many bugs after subscription"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful desktop like experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Why does this app not have keyframes effects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far it's the best phone video editor. Anyway I didn't expect anything less, it's Adobe we talking about."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good App to create awesome videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Friendly Video Editing App ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Still can't upload to YouTube, stopped using it because I kept getting a message after doing all the work and rendering my video to publish only to be told, Rush can't upload to YouTube at this time!! This has been going one for months (since July 2020 for me) and so I just tried again and STILL getting the message. So basically Adobe Premier Rush is useless. Can't even save my work to my own devices because I haven't upgraded and paid more money. Might have upgraded if the app actually worked!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love üíò it it is so simple to use!!! But I would love that you can add an effect to rotate images or videos besides the slide left or right and also to invert video like playing backwards."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Slight distortion in audio"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"suck"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"NYC app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's good for mixing photos and videos but I just wish I can add my music from my files otherwise it's okay."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Such a poor app, impossible to edit anything on mobile device, controls unresponsive. Don't waste your time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Audio recording is not good I face noise when I edit video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like the app. But the PC version is too heavy to run on small pc and laptop. What makes premiere and rush defferent is that rush is used my people how need flexibility and can edit a complete video even an web browsing laptop or any smartphone for that matter. Hope you would understand and make the required changes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have a Pixel 4 and this app is showing as not compatible!? What's going on Adobe? I pay for creative cloud and would love to use this app but I can't"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe did it's worst and gave this to us. A big disappointment. Please fix it and do fire the developers who developed it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best way to use editor I have found! A must try for anyone!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to edit any clip. The video becomes really jiterry and it continues even after the export. Please fix."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good rendering support"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple, perfect, easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely un-usable since the update. Every single time i import a soundtrack and lower the volume or enable auto duck, the audio pops. And I've lost my edits on a video twice in a row. Like vanished. I still have all the raw video on my device, but the edit on the app just vanishes, so I've had to start over twice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great potential, Terrible User Interface. I like the features Premiere Rush has, but the user interface is just bad. Why can't I hide the timeline? Why can't I maximize the view in portrait mode for 9:16 editing? Trying to add text, or change pan and zoom in 9:16 mode is like trying to thread a needle with a hammer because the window is so small. For a company that dominates video, photo, and graphics software on computers, you would think Adobe could make decent mobile apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Bad user experience (too small screens for a smartphone), crashes when exporting larger videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty Legit if u ask me. Simple..u can tell its the updated 2020 version. Nice and modern"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very very very slow the opposite of Rush.. Glitches all the time. The cross platform doesn't work well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why this is not working in real me 7 it is not displaying the sequence to edit reason"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What everyone says about this app and it crashing, is true! I was deceived because it worked one time, but never again! Do not get!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"great app to learn and edit but it has few issues after the recent update the rendering is too slow gets stuck almost everytime while playing it after adding effects it shouldn't be happening while using it in smartphone like 1+7t"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Video best Tranjection edition"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app was working fine before with minor performance issues but now when I try to export any video file it is just stuck at 3% from last 30 mins (export file size is 230 MB) .. I have Restarted the app and device multiple times, cleared cache but still the same."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A lot of bugs surprisingly. The app crashes in between even though I have a OnePlus 7T Pro. The video doesn't play in between editing. Other than that I just don't know how to trim an audio file or a video file or extend them like keep the audio on loop. Btw the audio isn't from the app but from my own device. Please help"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Really great UX, but every audio file I import gets screwed up. Mp3 and wav. It adds crackling sounds. So... not sure if I can use it. Oh and it adds clicking noises with mp4 audio too. And if you change the volume of any audio, it gets really screwed up. Just found that. I really want to give a good review, so as soon as they change this I will change my review. I'll check back in a little while."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lame features on Adobe Rush, Power Director is way better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great mobile editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy. Awesome. Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"With every update new bug is introduced"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very simple and straight to the point I like it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why is the video all black? The only thing that works well is the audio. This is nonesense"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing everytime I try to export. Takes several tries before I am able to save, currently I am not even able to save one of the videos I worked on. I cleared the cache and that did not help initially either. Cancelled my subscription, such a shame as this is a pretty decent video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Idiots made this app and nothing works. Audio is ruined when importing videos, video playback speed gets messed up, export looks like trash, glitchy, buggy, as usual with all adobe products. Trash. Uninstalling. You idiots should be ashamed youre paid so much to make apps that don't even work. I hope adobe dissolves this trash rush project."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This app would get 5 stars from me if I could add music that I created myself."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"IM IN LOVE WITH ADOBE CREATIVES...OMG SO WOW"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lagging like crazy on Note 20 Ultra 5G."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm still checking"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Too many crashes are driving me nuts!!! Even that being said, I really like it, simple and efficient, however, 1 out of endless exporting attempts works, that is really BAD!!! U GOTTA FIX THAT UP ASAP!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I loved this app but the last update, don't let me to upload my videos, it said that something is wrong with the app, fix it please ü•∫ because I loved this app.."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Clunky. Freezes up on galaxy s8. Can't open projects at top of list. Have to OPEN and close projects at the bottom to get the newest project far enough down that it will open. Sound handling leaves lots of blown out artifacts. Overall worka for creating my janky videos I am known for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not support"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I had to delete it to get past it trying to load projects. Then after finally being able to work on something, it refuses to render a 58 second clip where all I did was remove some time from the beginning and end of the video. Gets stuck at 1% and now it refuses to load the home. I am paying for the sub specifically to be able to use my phone to edit videos on the go, but apparently that's not happening. I hope this is fixed soon."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Unable to render my project, it freezes at 7%. And it's a monthly subscription"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app for Instagram Reels"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very impressive app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I have paid for this, use it every day, and I am deeply disappointed in the performance of it. Sometimes I have to turn on screen recording to get it to work smoothly. How does that even make sense?! And that's just the tip of the iceberg for issues with this app. It's got nice features, the end product is smooth and borderline-professional, but there are just too many issues with reliability and responsiveness."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple app but WOW! Amazing dude..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app is one of the most powerful video editing apps for mobile, and there is no watermark in the free version. But it is also the most unintuitive and hard to use app on my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Long time user of Adobe. This app is a fail. Crashes, glitchy, Audio is the worst. What a shame. And a waste of money"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lag on playing video while editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I only really use it cause it doesnt have a watermark, it's very limiting and often crashes and deletes all ur progress when moving video or audio files small or large"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Deeply disappointed, even crashes with a brand new phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bugs"

Please fix it and make things easier!"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app is everything I've been looking for in a mobile video editing software, except the voice-over function does not work properly and leaves my audio sounding very broken up and crackly. I tried using an external microphone on 2 different headphone sets and surprisingly the audio came out even worse. This just creates more work for me as now I have to export and record a voice-over using a different app or my computer."

There isn't a single feature that Inshot doesn't have plus every feature adobi au had was worse. I really hate to be rude because adobi is amazing... but why wouldn't you have extra features like glitchy filters, reverse film, easy trim, add your own track, mirror effects. and please fix the touch screen code or whatever it is... Gigapets from my 90s were more ergonomic on the hans... im sry for the grammar or whatever"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works great from the get-go for quick crude videos from my pixel 2. Old phone works just fine with the software. No glitches or hiccups from my experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I did about half a video with this app, but then it deleted all of the things on my account when the app glitched and the screen went black. I had to hope that my stuff was still saved, and fortunately, it was through another account. Downloading the video took a very long time, maybe an hour to only go halfway and tell me there was an error. I tried two times after that with the same results."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not at all good vita app is better and free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whenever I use this app, it usually crashes. Just pausing the video would cause it to bug."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience in rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A pain in the butt. Couldn't import photos from Dropbox but finally got all photos uploaded, made a stop motion, now video wont render and cant share. This app has ruined my week."

I've really been getting into the app and absolutely love it but I cannot have it crashing my phone everytime I try to create a new project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Impossible to import video from my device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I love nearly 90% of Adobe products, but what is this trash called Adobe Rush? It should be called Adobe CRASH! That's all it does when you import video, when you edit it, and when you export it. I have never seen such poor quality from this company."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great editor when it works, but frequent crashes and annoying bugs are holding it back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best mobile vid editing app out there"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Need more transition"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"WORST App EVER !! Never ever install this app. I installed the app started working on it and all of a sudden my phone got hanged for few hours then I had to reboot the phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need some more features like adding text, croping video etc.. after that i will definitely give u five stars..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"bad apps not Download anyone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Only edits videos taken on the phone. If I transfer videos from my camera onto my phone then it doesn't export the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"the worst I've ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing app that lets me edit videos like Premiere Pro, but its in my phone, like that's- that's just-ü§Øü§Ø Absolutely convenient and useful. Even though that subscription price though- yeaa. Still, great app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I really want to like and use this app, but it is full of crash bugs and missing features(like reversing a clip)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes and freezes like an app made by an intern developer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice work!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App freezes for every 5 mins. Need to close and reopen the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I like the program but can we have a search bar when looking for things to add? I hate scrolling through my entire music list of 1000+ songs before adding it to my video because there's no search bar"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not working properly every time I start the app and it got freeze"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Doesn't even do flip for mirrored selfie videos. And the UI is about as unintuitive as it can be. There's space for icons to get options that you have to double-tap, etc. but no, they expect you to just read their minds as to how you get rotate etc. But still no flip. Useless for a mobile oriented app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app üëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Very very impressed. Thanks to the dev team. Yall keep doing this amazing work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I like being able to edit longer clips but spark is still easier and more intuitive to work with. Might just need more practice but still way easier than full Premiere."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app is so buggy. I worked for a project and the video won't start playing after doing editing. Time wasted. The features are really good but if it is unuseable then it is useless. Who is testing the app before release? Really sad to see such a buggy app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good no adverts until now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"New layout is unusable why would you do this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I have basic understanding of premiere pro, this is very handy to have as sometimes I do not have access to computer to do editing. Would be great addition to add a few extra effects like blur, zooms, key frames to emulate zoom and other cool effects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great ‚ù§Ô∏è ty adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice editing software, I like it"

I really think this app needs a lot of updates because this app is getting hard to work with."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing. I love this app and Adobe so much! Makes my life incredibly easy!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App crashing while rendering on my Oneplus 7T"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app was working fine until the end of October 2020. Unable to export files and crashes now between my laptop and phone. Unless these issues are fixed I wouldn't recommend paying for this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's crashing a lot from 2 MB videos !!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's very slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This apps pretty good. I was away from my PC and couldn't edit in davinci resolve so I used this and had no problems."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When u insert a video u don't see it's video content u only can here it's audio how can we edit like that and it's also super slow compared to others"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"UI feels good. Errors in playback in editor, very stuttery. Freezes when trying to export large videos after editing. Errors in playback when syncing alongside music/imported audio over clips. This app is in desperate need of attention. Very buggy for its price point."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Simply, clean, and productive. Just what the doctor ordered for a social media creator on the go. I do wish you could do more with the color editing like an s-curve, color isolation, and black and white scales with a histogram. Other than that, great so far for a mobile editor on the go!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app üëçüëç"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great in the beginning . After about 3 uses it told me there was an error with every video I uploaded."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best by far but its a shame you can't put in marker points on the music which is such a simple and effective way to keep the video correctly allined with the music. When are you think about putting this feature in to Rush?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The app has always been great. But all those easy-to-use options are only useful if the app works properly without crashing and without constantly restarting my phone. Unfortunately, that's not the case. I seriously am disappointed because this used to be my go-to app for editing."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a pretty cool app. It's got a lot of features for free, including filters, transitions and several others. Too bad it won't allow format conversions, but hey. It's overall a pretty intuitive editor. 8.5/10."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works better than expected"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Incredible video editor. Keeps it's promises."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have installed but I can't sign in into the app. Why is it so? What's the solution?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too many lag...Inconsistent app...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't install. The program frozed my note9. Don't risk it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not ideal if your new to editing and unable to cut out unwanted bits from the video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Now it keeps stopping whenever I'm exporting üòÇ this is just too much."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's freaking complicated ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best vdo edit app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Yeah these bugs and glitches is a bit annoying and I have low patience so its actually EXTREMELY annoying to having to wait more than 15 secs for it to play the video I'm editing or even open the project itself. Good update but might need another one for the basic technical stuff. Great app overall. Been using for a couple months for my YouTube."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app have some bugs. It will getting force close after 15 minutes editing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT, THANK YOU SO MUCH!‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whenever I just try to start a new project I can't see the uploaded video while I can hear the audio ,but can't see anything!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"A great move from Adobe but it is really glitchy as of now also if a colour correction option was available it would have been good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Professional!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Rendering freezes and takes over all the resources of the device. Sometimes even makes the device reboot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Features didnt always work (starting graphics tool, editing test, moving playhead, applying color to text)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super B....!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When editing videos it just shows black screen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for editing light vlogging, can add some motion graphics and effects. No key framing that im aware of just sliders and overlays. Quick processing and loading time (depending on which device you're using, Note 10+ seemed ok) from the 5 minutes I needed this for the app has done its job well."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome features. Easy and simple. Better than any other app on mobile I think."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using Rush for my on the go projects. Very powerful editor with great features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The program became worse overtime since the initial download. My videos take multiple attempts to export, export time is super slow for a short 2-3 min video. I like the app because it's nice to edit quick videos on my phone but what's the point of i record something and almost take an hour to be able to upload."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashers. Unusable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing. All the time. I have a pixel 3 as reference."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best regards"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Update: you can now export unlimited video edits. Thanks Adobe!! Changed my review to 5 star. It is the best of the video editing apps I've tried."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was OK. I have a full creative suite account via corporate email but can't log in. Clunky for phone use. Limited titles and overlays. Avoid unless you have no choice. 50$ for something so limited not worth the time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't have access to a computer to edit my videos right now, so I've been editing them all on my phone. Unfortunately, most of the features like the graphics do not work for me, before and after the update. They look really nice and I would love to use them, but they simply do not upload or show up after I've selected the one most suited for my video. It's really disappointing and frustrating when I see the options available, but have never worked for me. I've uninstalled, still doesn't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"After the Adobe MAX 2020, I am so excited to make my first video clip. However after I rendered it and try to play the video, it glitches all the way (like the camera is blinking eye instantly). Not sure is it because I'm using Android phone.. I see all the speakers who doing the demo, everything is so smooth... Hope this app could fix all the glitch and lagging and app crash issues in coming updates.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"No option for high frame rate recording yet in the inbuilt camera"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Easy UI to edit. Simple on the go. Love it. However. Can't export anything. I've tried re encoding original files to various file types and retried exporting with no success. Using Samsung Note 10+. I've taken a screen recording to send thru the app. Unfortunately when I try attaching the file it also gives me an error that the file type is unsupported and it's only 20 MB file. A few things broken. Hopefully it gets updated and fixed. Would love use it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good one for fast edits"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Feels like a mobile version of Premier Pro which is great. I have a lot of experience using that program and so this was easy enough to grasp. Even for new users I'd say it's just as easy if you follow the tutorial they give you when you first open the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If you want to edit a video to lose its all quality and details after rendering choose ""Adobe Rush"". Shame on ""Adobe"" to launch this garbage application under their belt. No 4k rendering, ok can we render videos and keep the original 1080p quality atleast??? If I do render a 100MB video, what I get after the render is 5-8MB video (no crop, no corrections), ""Adobe wake up"" this is 2020 and people aren't using VGA quality camera or 3.5 inch square screens to watch 8MB videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This is great app for creating video. But some times video playing has stack, for recovering need to restart app. It doesn't have filters in music and audio effects library, do not understand how to find what you need for your project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good for basic video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Never edited a video b4 & I'm old and I got this on one try."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It keeps not loading my projects until i uninstall and reinstall. This is the second time I've had to uninstall it. Please fix this. And when it doesn't load it doesn't let me create a project either."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't use after update"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Please make this app with more features even Power Director has More features than this app When I downloaded I hope it will a Killer App Of 2020.but made me unhappy.this features are for just beginners please try to Upgrade with more exiting features like Your Primiere Pro (My favourite desktop Software)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling because the app sends notifications with no ability to turn them off in the in app settings. Other than that the app is good. But one star because I hate unsolicited unremovable push notifications"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful! No words for this app! Extremely helpful and the best it there"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app and very easy for use"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"nothing loads won't let me export or import overall garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great option to make great videos on mobile device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Sound and Fury. Basically tried to create a 15 second clip and after 2 hours and too many shutdowns, I never finished. Best bet is to get Video Guru. It's free and it WORKS!!! This app isn't as good as you'd think from Photoshop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It keeps crashing:/ its really easy to use but it keeps crashing and its annoying"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Truly awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"GAMEPLAY LAGS DURING EDITING .PLEASE FIX THIS."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When videos are processing, Rush is causing my Garmin Fenix watch to continually get messages from Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Im still installing but i see the future adobe is the best trusted developer ever salute to Lightroom"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"MAJOR POTENTIAL ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This App has the perfect number of options and actions but it CRASHES!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"i would love to give it 5 stars. the only problem wchich occurred with me is audio problem (i tried to uninstall and install app several times) after exporting the added audio (or song) feels cutted or it jumps for between frames. really annoying"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Honestly pretty good! Nice transitions and overlays you can use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Everything is fine, except voice recorder. It creates some tic tic noise in background."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience.. Once imported, it simply cannot play videos captured on 720p or 1080p. It crashes multiple times. Using this app to apply filters and adjust video aspects is a painful process. I cannot believe adobe made this app. Apps like youcut, kinemaster, vita are way more simple and useful then this one."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The installation fails even after clearing the Play Store cache and data files and rebooting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mass"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't even finish the tutorial: Error: Couldn't create the project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is terrible how can I edit a video I cant see? Broken app, har to use and a waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No blend mode, i update for 5star once have"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No mobile Video Editing apps are perfect without Ability To edit in Landscape mode, editing in portrait mode makes my both hands and fingers Cramps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Always system storage is low and things don't work."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worse app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"A like the software alot and i use it to make vhs edits but while making edits it messes up the audio all of a sudden and starts lagging and also doesn't have alot of transitions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best easy to use on the go video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not stable for Android 10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This tool helps us create meaningful sequences of video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe is the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good, but no super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unusable, even worse than Clip and that's saying something - preview window freezes on Samsung Note 9"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cannot express how disappointed I am in this app. If you try cutting an audio file too much the beginning gets completely corrupted and unusable. It's like the sole purpose of this app and it can't do that right. It draws you in with false promises and then doesn't work correctly at all"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect! Only issue is that some combinations of filters cause it to fail to render. When it does render, it's a great app! I use it to quickly edit together multiple clips from drone videos with an SD card adapter."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot render video I edited."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"THANK YOU FOR 60FPS EXPORT"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app for smartphones"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is too heavy and takes too much storage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy uploads for social! Quick edits too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for beginners I like this app. Would like even more if you add some animated tiles to texts and a PIP mode in the near update. Regards"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptional please include stabilization also"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I'm not able to export my video and I have spent hours on it. You better get this fixed. I have even paid for the stupid subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Everything is fine bt plzz aad crome in this aap..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not that great. Every time I go to ""render"" a video, the app gets about 25% thru and crashes. Even shortened the video in half, made no difference. I've tried about a dozen times and it has yet to change. Restarted phone, done everything I know to do but it continues refusing to work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Take to long to load the homescreen"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's a lovely app for editing videos but I have a RAM of 6GB and it still stops responding. Every 10 minutes I have to clear my cache and residuals to make sure it restarts. Luckily the project autosaves but it's super inconvenient"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It is a good app but the audio stutters when I export it need update asap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very happy with this app. Super easy to learn."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this apk!! Its help me to show my game play to my followers!!! Best editing apküíØ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You know what would be really cool? Being able to download the freaking app. Play store let's it download up to 99% then says ""can't install"". YOU'RE ADOBE...IS THIS A JOKE?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"THIS IS EVERYTHING I NEED!! Its such a good video editing app and honestly once you've mastered the features its really fun to use! It crashes little bit and I wish the speed feature had a higher capacity hut honestly whos perfect ya know? Its worth what I payed for!! If you have an Adobe subscription and you need a video editing app for your phone/tablet and imovie isnt an option! Get Adobe Priemere Rush!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"very easy interface, liked it very much"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Reverse option will be highly appreciable. #needupdate"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"No more than 30 fps or 1080p resolution"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Instagram : reza_aziz.31"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering speed to slow. Like really bad."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm pretty upset with this program. I paid for the full version because I thought it would include some good stuff. Waste of money... First: Transitions suck. No way around that, get Vivacut full version if you want transition options. Second: There is no benefits to this program over other options on the market. It's editing capabilities are subpar, and there is no special features that stand out. Third: I lost several videos that I can't refilm. They are just error messages now.. RIP my work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Can I edit a pro gaming video from it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"As a free software it's okay. No way I'm paying ¬£35 annually for it though as there are no additional transitions or motion effects. I don't even get the option for a Pan and Zoom on Android. That's such a basic tool and isn't available."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is very good for editing and graphics thanks Adobe for making this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app would be great if it actually worked. Constantly having issues with it not responding. When I try to edit my videos, they have a weird lag to them. Literally the worst. It's such a shame. I was considering buying the paid version but I don't trust that it will work any better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nothing better than editing videos on the Go!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The simplest actions is extremely hard to make. Barely usable on mobile device"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App wont load my current project... great...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes very frequently"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sexy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"If I could use it in landscape mode like all the other editing apps, I'd buy it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering takes forever and the final video glitches and skips frames."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"app crash, Export Problem, Colour Blink,less Touch Response. Help out !!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Some time it does not respond ü§îü§îü§î"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple, gets the job done, perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i love imovie because imovie is free but Rush is not free and now i'm study i don't have money üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"More feature is needed for free version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless app, the video does not even show up, this is such a horrible app it does not even work,"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lovely features But every time app crashing every time not working properly loading loading loading ........in the end same loading whatever you do loading Do something na plzz üôè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Premiere has some lags and not fast"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At first works perfectly but everytime I try and export with music attached the music it glitched in the final product??? Plus due to its price for the pro version isn't really worth it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"First review I've ever left on G.Play. I have been using the Adobe Suite for over a decade and this is easily the worst product Adobe's ever released. I have constant problems using the software on my Google Pixel 3 XL. The phone has plenty of RAM and disk space available. I hibernate all other apps. The Pixel 3 and Rush are up to date. Still constant crashing. If you can finally finish a 'project' and by that I mean basic color corrections to a 4 second clip, the export fails 100% of the time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb editor for video editing.....lots of options in editing.....love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Love the easy and simple intuitive editing and features. But this app crashes so much while editing and quite often while exporting! I've got a powerful new phone, tried all the suggestions to stop it from crashing. Really frustrating, been trying to love it, but looking for a new app right now! What's the point if it can't export a 25sec video üëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All I wanted to do was drop the audio off my video half way through and couldn't even do that. Also doesn't export in 4K unless you purchase. what's the point."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't install this app how I install"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's a shame adobe is not able to make a good phone app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just wanna say thank You"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Extremely laggy on my S10+, very slow. Even Inshot works better than this (No hate on Inshot it's a great app, but this is Adobe we're talking about, they're supposed to be superb with these editing apps whether it's on PC/Mobile)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly using a Samsung Tab S7"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Impossible to sync audio to video or to make semi-detailed edits. Those are two very basic needs for editing video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.üëçüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"intuitive and convenient"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App is crashing again and again"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even create a project. It just keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"poor video quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best üíØ no adds app for editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like this software. In my pc I edit video with Adobe Premiere PRO."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Where are Effects!!!??? Just 3 of them no more"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app has become even worse. I can no longer export videos to my phone, I was trying to export a video that was taking over 20 minutes, and when it finished I checked my phone and it wasn't even exported to my phone. üò° I also have to tap on my video 50 times before it will even load up the content. The desktop app is amazing, I don't know why the mobile version sucks so bad!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's waaay better then any other app forrr reeel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app has crashed 3 times by now... I had to reinstall in 3 times with all my previous works gone!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best mobile phone editor yet. Definitely worth the extra money for premium"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crackling noise in voice over, using z fold 2. No issues with kinemaster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant do any edits in this app. When i import my video and hit play, only the audio play. Video is black screen. I have 3gb ram. I have tried uninstall. And install. Restart. Still same results. Pls fix this. This a good app in mobile, if it only works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Selecting media could be improved. Sometimes the audio clips in the preview. Add a search function (for selecting audio at the least)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"What a disappointment. I bought this for $9.99 a month and it behaves like a free program. On my phone, a Samsung S10+, the videos upload EXTREMELY SLOW and there is no touch response many times when I tap my screen. On my laptop, only 2 years old, my video had severe color issues. I downloaded new video drivers from intel that fixed the color problem. Now, my videos and audio is so jerky it can't be watched. I've spent 6 hours today trying to make this work. So much for easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No ew gross"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This free video editing app is easy to use & does gives good options for editing videos. The only problem is that as far as media content, it only likes Apple content but not Android. I created/edited a video w/ videos taken w/ both an apple phone & Samsung Note 10+. The videos taken w/ the Apple cell looks fine but content taken w/ my android phone is downgraded drastically. I upgraded to the paid version & it made no difference. Do not recommend for android users. I contacted the developers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and has everything u need if you just want the basics. It's really saved me with the online learning video assignments."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful Application 5 star"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"it is slow to render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty buggy once you upgrade."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I have a samsung s10 plus, sometimes during the edition the video won't play, i have to wait for several seconds till this happens. Why dont you include a 24fps kn the exportation window? It would be great ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best in the business"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I got what I need"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app will not even stay open without crashing on my Google Pixel 3"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I used a little bit √†nd I liked but there is one problem with my edit because this app does not have frame chapter like tacking a frame √†nd using √†s image for the edit and over all its good and b√†d"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe is at the top of their game üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Let me do everything I wanted to do, including precisely rotating and resizing a video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Waaaay better than standard editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It crashes on both my iPad and phone. Especially when I'm working with larger files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"If it worked it would be amazing (Pixel 3 XL) Adobe... What is there to say other than I hope future of creative software is not this frustrating. It will not complete rendering. Editing is buggy unless you allow the program time to syncs your clips. Once it says it has they aren't available in the cloud. Rush Is every bit as buggy and frustrating as other CC software. 2 stars instead of 1 because there's nothing similar on market. Hopefully time will change that as with the rest of this suite."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awsm app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Rendered video doesnt play smoothly. It doest skip some frames and also color correction flikers and spikes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Yus but how do i get Premium it's not letting me get it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Way more intuitive and capable than earlier versions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Needs improvement"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Has suddenly stopped exporting to my gallery. The app says it's exported but it's not there. S9+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ek number"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works flawlessly, easy to understand."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video not playing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It doesn't fetch my previous projects neither creates new"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app for making quick videos. A unique complaint: the app name itself is simply titled ""Rush"" which made me have difficulties searching when I downloaded it. I had typed ""Premiere Rush"" in my app list but it wasn't able to show up. The iOS version has the full name which I think is much more intuitive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It works really good. Would be better with a few more cinematic aspect ratios."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bar none, this is the WORST app I've ever used. Convoluted mess, even for the simplest actions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and pretty powerful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DONT EVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP I DID AND MY PHONE DID NOT WORK FOR 32 HOURS BECAUSE OF THIS APP IT WILL ALSO FREEZE AND HEAT UP YOUR PHONE"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent processing speed (with a well equipped phone) and very user friendly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Starting using now only. Just feeled exited and Awesome guyz"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes very frequently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very convenient but freezes up alot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Glitches in exported files"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly powerful video editor for phone. Feels like Davinci Resolve (my usual editing app)."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app I have ever used."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The projects dont load sometimes. The app has some pretty good tools for editing and I enjoy using it to edit my videos. The only thing I dislike is the app doesn't load my projects sometimes! I have never written a review, but I just couldn't take it anymore and so I'm here to vent! There's a bug where the projects don't load unless you close out of the app a few times and reopen them. Beware! I would be giving this app a 5 stars if this wasn't such a huge issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good video editing software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Soooo cool I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Way too many bugs make it a nightmare to work with. Need to be polished bit more."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It says there is an error after I finished editing my video and I am ready to export !!! Idk what's going on with the app! I don't want to loose the hours of work spent on editing my video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and very helpful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crazy permissions"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes every 5 seconds and finally finished a video and trying to export but crashes so cant get final video üòµ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You have to have a profile to use this app. Automatic 1 star."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Not up to Kinemaster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just started the app and it has been ""fetching projects"" for a minute and won't load. POS."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Occasional saving of exported video issues. Infrequently, but it seems to misjudge storage on the Pixel 4. Other than that, it truly performs as well as id like it to. A few minor sacrifices on the mobile version, but that's to be expected with reduced hardware. I use this regularly to edit videos and haven't looked for another app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Idk how to use this but people know üòï"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Basically, you try their free trial and automatically they sign u up for a $22 monthly fee. When u try to cancel they charge u a $40 early fee- so the free trial has u paying $62 HUGE SCAM. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It has been the best app for video editing since it released. Not recently it is causing some issues. My phone has never crashed in the last 3 years. But something has changed in the recent Rush updates and it managed to give me that experience. Even when editing very small videos, and with 5gb free ram and 835 processor, this app is now not able to give a good experience. It ain't reliable now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love being able to cut pro quality videos right on my phone. Exceptional resource, thanks Adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"My favourite tool to edit videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great and helpful app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Waw"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The layout looks awesome, and it's clear. The only problem is that I cannot cut the clips or change the speed. I have a Pixel 4, I really want to being able to use the app. I am pretty sure I could love this tool if the icons were in place."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really complete"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent editor. I love the intuitive interface and range of options. I especially like the color settings, as my dumb videos are far from professional :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Takes alot of time to render, pretty useless, not expecting such services from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy and convenient to use! I love this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Can't change font colors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super cool smooth no bugs nice features thank you adobe and its free to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The audio lags ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Videos don't show up in device folders! I try to upload a video but with the rush app the video doesn't exist on my phone! Ridiculous!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app deserves no stars. Edited one video. Can't get in now or edit again. App just stalls on start up. I read the reviews and couldn't believe that Adobe would get such terrible ratings. I understand why now. I had a small lump some of savings in Adobe stocks... Well I'll be selling those too. Good bye Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy app for quick editing, just note, it's just basic things you need for short clips."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"What a great app. Helps to edit on finger tips and sparks creativity. Love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The editing on this app is exceptional. I wish it were a bit more intuitive when it came to adding media to the project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Yee fun"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrifying app. I imported a video with audio completely out of sync, spent an hour fixing it manually, and then exported to find that the audio was out of sync again!! There are tons and tons of complaints about this online and Adobe has done nothing to solve the issue. Super disappointed at how much they don't care. Don't pay for this app. I know I won't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This does exactly what I wanted that others couldn't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it should give color mix option like lightroom. video reverse option. and audio fade in-out option."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"very difficult to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pure disaster ... Crashing on 8 gb phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A rendered video can turn out a little glitch at times but if you just render it again things should be fine. Overall a good editor for in the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great!!!!"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app feels like an abusive relationship. Don't use it if your going to have strict deadlines, it's just not worth the risk. If there's anything I like about this app is the ease of laying out clips on the timeline as well as adjusting clip length. Everything else is so horrible, it makes me boil in anger to the point of tears because you pay for this and it has so many issues. If you dont back up your work, it will crash and erase it, I swear this app is something else."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"waste of time"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Im unstall it...every time hang not respond....."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is a real solid editor for basic things you need to do on the fly. Really intuitive to pickup it you already use a linear editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"F this app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Adobe always best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So far so good. The learning curve is slow with me but I'll figure it out. There's way more here to give me precisely what I'm looking for in a video editor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have a relatively small project and on export it crashes and restarts the app. The syncing seems to be broken as well. I was hoping to jump on my desktop and export it but the files aren't there. I'm hoping to see these issues fixed."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This is a fantastic app from an interface perspective. Really easy to use and smooth. Great ability to edit the way you want. I love it. HOWEVER, it crashes constantly. I am using a Google Pixel 4, a phone that should not struggle at all with simple video editing and rendering. These day the app succeeds to playback or render even short stitch edits roughly 40% of the time of leads. This is why it gets 2 stars. I imagine this is a bug and I've sent in a bug report. I look forward to future fixes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Useless it has a bug where while editing my video doesn't play"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Using a new 2020 LG app takes forever to load and I'm not seeing any video, just hearing audio. Not happy!!! I am a long time adobe product user for desktop. Photography and video..."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's basically imovie for android which is amazing. I just wish i could animate images on top of a video like draw with key frames"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use premier on pc and this is very easy to use,very nice, this is just amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio gets glitched and not the best quality. Still crashes even though I have an 8 GB RAM and the rendering speed is so slow."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Did exactly what I needed!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Just needs to implement a seamless way of adding royalty-free music to short clips, similar to the way Instagram does it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have Samsung Note10+ and can use many apps with high performance but Rush is may be worst app in the world because it is full of the errors."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"There are a few bugs but provides all tools for editing. Super app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for me being a beginner, would recommend this app to anyone looking for a quick easy app to edit on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app sucks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very versatile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Be good if it didn't keep freezing! I own a well equipped phone that shouldn't have any issues doing some simple video editing. Every other editor I've used does that job without a hiccup! Only premiere seems to have a issue..I would've loved to have this as my editor, but I'm the current state that it's in I'll just have to keep using what I'm using. Hopefully they work out the kinks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Katil"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Son of a bug"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it üíô"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Seems good. Need to figure out more how to use it. But I was in too much of a ""rush"" for the tutorial"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am using a flagship phone with 8 gb ram. And still this app crashes after few edits and I have to restart my phone and resume my work. Any it happens everytime. Developers can work on this big issue. Rest I am impressed by the way the app is designed to match the premiere pro pc version easy and way better than other apps if the crashing issue is fixed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Why is there no frame rate selection option in the camera mode for my OnePlus 6???"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"BEST EDITING SOFTWARE FOR THE ANDROID"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The options to edit are there but when you click on filters or anything, it won't work. Not worth it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn. Great for trimming up quick videos!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pretty decent, just started to export a 700 mb file and its making my phone vibrate. Like short bursts every half second. And it won't export my video, I get about half way through and the app just fails, incredibly frustrating... Also you should make it possible to link Spotify or SoundCloud so we can attach music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just subscribed and haven't had a chance to edit one video sequence. App just keep closing. What's the use of paying for something you can't rely on!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It crashes a lot i cant even finish a video im using a pixel 3xl device and it keeps crashing please fix this"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. But need more options."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best video editor for free that I have ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing deep features to make videos professional looking. And easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Rush struggles with media playback. I'd import my 2-3 minute clip and watch it buffer for a couple minutes due to the app rendering it's audio and video, sometimes taking longer than the actual clip itself. This wasn't the main problem however, as some clips would fail to render and end up crashing the app entirely. I couldn't even delete the clip responsible as attempting to open the project again would crash it seconds later and it wouldn't even save my changes before crashing anyway."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The only problem about this app is that it crashes. Every time I try to zoom the timeline and split the footage, the app crashes and I've to restart my phone. Dear Adobe, please do something about this. Thank you....."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Better and better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Forced account requirement"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app but you know what make it greater if we can change the colour of titles templates and if it includes shapes that are made for youtube creators like thumps upüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not conclude all media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Was the one best choice for creating my creative videos on my Samsung S9+ and now finally it presents here for my Samsung S20 ultra. I am üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The features are wonderful. But, the app will always crash whenever I have it opened for a long time or even while using it to edit my videos. Please fix this constant crashing. The features are already excellent. I would recommend this as a video editing software on mobile if it weren't for the app's constant crashing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's really hard to do anything I hate it I'm uninstalling sorry"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Muy bueno, solo me gustar√≠a poder controlar el volumen de la m√∫sica"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unacceptable delay in exported video. this ruins entire purpose of the app. Quality is not compromised,which i am happy of cuz that's the only parameters other apps fails to keep up with"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just soo awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love it, quick and easy! Doesn't have all the bells and whistles but it gets the job done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Just bought the newest Tab S7 to work on my vids problem less... No way, it's crashing only so often but I managed to build half hour for... Now it's impossible to export as it's always crashing at the beginning of rendering. Waste of money ? Are you planning any improvements for Tab S7 ?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just love this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"World best Pro Camera App and World best Pro level video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Gud app for editing. But the problem is it stuck regularly while editing. This is a big issue for me. And after triming the vedio by matching with the inserted sound track the timing of the exported video and sound trck changes. This causes a mismatch between sound and vedio."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No picture on the screen while i import videos. Sounds only üò£"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"No reverse video feature. Reverse footage is one of those fundamental features it's missing some how."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nothing to say... SPEECHLESS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to edit videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lots of bug, s20+ performance is slow as a turtle. Android development team should be in shame! App crashes while second export attempt."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app in the world"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I was overwhelmed by how many options there are."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unable to fetch projects and unable to load videos. Really frustrating I was excited to use the app after researching it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's really bad. No timberline or key frames. Audio can't be keyed either. No support for chroma key either. Kinemaster is way better, and less expensive."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app amazing even if you don't pay for the premium very professional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app makes no since I hate it, its not at all what i wanted:("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"limited of course being on a phone, but even so, it's a little too minimalistic with the ui imo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't export No matter what format I used I can't render and export a 10 minute video. I really want a refund for this. I came on and paid the subscription just for one video and now I can't even export it"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Frequently it hangs on android . Features is good stability is bad."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Already done in edition part BUT CAN'T EXPORT !!!???"

I need this app... please fixe the issues. Make it bug free and crash free for all... Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APP. They use small print to rope you into the program at an annual fee, then charge you half the fee to cancel it. I thought I was getting a monthly plan, NOPE! I wanted to use this for my students but then realized we didn't have the time for it so I tried to cancel it, now I am out of 40 dollars, DURING A PANDEMIC!! Adobe is the worst ever DO NOT BUY!! Find a different software to use, because this one is built on shady business practices, and hidden fees. Never again!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As always, adobe is the best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Why does this have to crash so often on my S10E?! I love the app when it works, I love that it's basically the most full featured NLE on Android, but it just crashes or fails to load my projects so often it's silly. Can you guys analyze my crash logs or anything and get this resolved?"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Regularly experiences issues rendering. Reboots app during render, doesn't create a video file."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for editing and rendering videos quickly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"A great alternative to the PC version. But when rendering videos, it might crash now and then."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fun n user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like the old version than the new one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes every time Ioad more than one video file to edit. Never had the issue when first installing the app but in recent updates I can no longer use this app effectively. Shame as it was the best available on Android."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it but don't want to paid."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice video quality. We want more efx."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"When it works it's amazing. Most of the time it stalls out and has to restart something that should take 2-3 minutes is taking 45 mins at best. Not acceptable for an app that is supposed to be for quick edits. No issues on the IOS side of the app. Just wish the Android version would work as well. Will have to try it again after an update."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps on freezing ü•∂ up on me. I have to shut down and reopen a project. I have a Note 10 Plus."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It sometimes just wont load a video you import. Itll just sit on a black screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I think that it is a very good app! It helps with editing for putting music in the background or like a meme. But once I was making a video and it crashed my whole phone almost broke it, this isnt a complaint but after when I went back to edit it didnt let me open the file or even start a new one. I hope you guys can fix that other wise I loved it u till you crashed my phone, oh ya and there is like no add I love that too"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hangs in between editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You know this used to be my go to app for editing and it was amazing with minor bugs. I currently just upgraded to a Note 20 Ultra (super powerful device) and ever since the last update I cannot render my project for my life. I've tried 4k, 1080, even 720 and the app just crashes. So much so it's been crashing even just trying to open up my project. For a service that I'm paying for I'm extremely disappointed as to how much the app crashes now. I really hope Adobe can fix it ASAP."

When all clips are .mp4, could only render 1080 at same framerate. Didn't see a closed captions option. When bugs are fixed this is a 5 for sure."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gostei muito deste aplicativo. Pior que j√° usava o Adobe Premiere no PC, j√° queria mesmo usar no telem√≥vel para facilitar certas coisas."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its ok just laggy and eh not really good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lots of bugs, crashes everytime. Please improve this it's my humble request . Downloaded video gets delayed or becomes faster by microsecond, everything is wasted after that!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"UI is pretty close to perfect and the multiple video tracks make it a strong contender but every render it puts out is ruined by frequent video frame studders"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"First time using with no instructions, skipped the tour and the app was still user friendly and ran smooth"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super app very easy to use best video editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app used to be my go-to for video editing, because it was simple and flawless. However, I keep having problems where the app crashes and deletes most of what I've done, or while exporting the all will crash so there's no point even in editing. I really hope it can be fixed because the idea is great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app ,it's so helpful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This thing is way easier than waste money on pc softwares"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Why is the download restricted to certain phones A51 not compatible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have tried to install 4 times and it will not install. Never had this problem before. Rebooted and still will not install :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"ITS REALLY 3.5 STARS This app is beautiful and seamless. Only the bugs for it are random and happen often. I've had to re-download 4 times now because of loading and glitch issues. But through all of it this app is still one of the best for editing. I was just able to render my first project (I had others I wanted to but couldn't because of the glitches ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è) hopefully I can keep this luck going."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it cannot support on my XZ2 Premium, i will give 5 if support on Sony XZ2 Premium"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"SUBSCRIBE 2 HTX BEN G ON YOUTUBE This app is awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not recommended for serious video editors. Will just lead to frustration how clunky the ui is and how limited the features are. Simply trying to cut footage was tedious as their method for cutting is dragging handles, that is similar to the motion for moving clips around. Can't easily make multiple cuts, have to do a duplicate clip workaround. The best thing I can say about this app is cloud syncing let me easily move the footage to my desktop so I could really edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, really good for beginner in editor. Simple and clean interface to make your own videos, good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I have to say, this is an amazing app. I watched a couple YouTube tutorials on how to use it, and I was set. Still learning, but happy with the results. I will say that am am lucky to have a Note 10 with a stylus pen. The titles are extremely small and would have been a nightmare to use otherwise."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"From the start I am eager to open the application yet its extremely appalling, its very stacking when you use it on telephone (idk in laptop/pc). A few highlights are additionally gross, I UNISNTALL IT!!! it doesnt meet my expectation :(("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best vide editing software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So convenient."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"PASSWORDS ARE SO ANNOYING!!!!!! YOUR PASSWORD SYSTEM SUCKS BAD!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I was really glad when I found an app where I could type in a specific length for the clips (most apps won't let me make it shorter than a second), but way too often the audio cuts and won't play properly, which makes it really frustrating to sync my clips up with music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Wouldnt recommend it, doesn't work good on OnePlus7T"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Downloaded for basic video editing, works perfectly for my purpose. UI is great and easy to navigate."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"3 transitions, lag in speed ramping and resizing. Expected better from Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app keep laging and stop working continuously. Please fix it otherwise the app is very useful and easy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The Best Video Editing In Smart Phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app very good. I like it.but When your video editing finished after when you saving to go it's taking too much time.My video was 714 Mb but video save to took time more then 1hours. Can you fix this problem."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Overall it's a useful app to post-process videos, but has following key features missing: 1. Warp Stabilization. 2. Ability to convert 60 fps into 24 fps / Export in 24 fps. Both of which should be a non-premium feature."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice editing üëå use this apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible made my videos sound like they had autism"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"requires sign-in"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is just fetching and fetching and not allowing me to create project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Fudu app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I'm editing in oppo reno 2f phone While video on screen goes black i cant see what im editing or creating"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App rarely works correctly, has multiple hard crashes and has many problems just uploading videos to the workspace."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"How to reverse clip in rush?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"For a while it was not working. It was stuck in an initialize mode."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not bad, I'm not a picky person. Its seems to do the job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is the worst app ever. Please don't download it is a total waste of time. It only gives you 3 basic transitions and some filters that can only be unlocked if you use pro. All other features are very basic that can be found in any editing app. Very complicated and horrible. üò†üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not very intuitive, been using premiere for years and still cant work this thing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very bad...poor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keep crushing while exporting video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Is really simple and easy to use. Would like to have more features tho"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing functionality especially for mobile video editing. The best features are paid, but there is plenty of free features to stay busy with. Easy to learn and quick to use interface. Glitchy AF on my S8. Gets hung up on cloud synch which is mandatory to initialize the app. Adobe will probs fix it soon though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its actually pretty nice, im just not the smartest so it's hard for me to understand it all. But with that being said I still have made 3 videos so far and they haven't been completely terrible!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"On Galaxy tab s7+ can't edit files, it crashes while scrubbing the time line, or playing single clip. Useless and big disappointment for me. Bought the tablet for cross platform editing, but it is useless with Rush"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Why I'm not able to attach audio to clips."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"What a hot garbage of wasted potential. This is coming from someone who pays for both premiere as well as lightroom for over for years now. Stay away. Just wasted potential"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's a really nice I use it to make videos for YouTube but while exporting a video it said there was not enough space I have over 5 gigabytes free on my phone and the estimated file size is 2.5 gigabytes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"""Could not create project"" is all I see when I open this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Simply doesn't work. Several features missing, honestly the current version that I downloaded as of 8/18/2020 is unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Loved it can't use now fetching project stays on the screen forever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even get past the ""fetching project"" screen. It also won't start a project from imported videos from my library. It's a shame, I'm very familiar with premiere pro and I was hoping I could use this to edit on the go but I guess that's not happening."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It was fine until today. Keeps on crashing while exporting videos üò°"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app wouldn't work for it kept crashing over and over amd over , wouldn't save any of my work the text bar doesn't work the controls wouldn't work either just stick to the real thing in pc if you can this sucks."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used it, was amazing! But reopening it anytime after that didnt work. It was always a black screen and I couldn't see, hear or do anything"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I edit all my videos on this app. It is easy to use, I wish there was a light theme."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"In my poco f1 it installed but its not working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Keeps repeating some syllables and misalignes the audio and video when I do anything to it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A little odd to get used to in ur phone, but so far loving it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps saying fetching projects and never opens. I signed out and tried uninstalling the app. I have the paid version."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After 1st launch app shows ""fetching my projects"" (Even though the is the 1st time I've ever used the app.) It consistently spins and never finds anything. Then I tired to make a new project and kept getting. ""Error couldn't create project"" Seems like you guys have a few bugs to work out. I had to uninstall for now."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app was great while it worked, but after the last update it I'm unable to even get started as it is perpetually stuck ""fetching projects""."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love this app but I wish there was a chroma key feature"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never seen any worse update than the latest one. FIX THIS APP ALREADY MAN. IT LAGS AND GLITCHES. I HAVE A SD 855+ GOD DAMMIT.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy interface. How could you not love this app?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Standard editing experience without any irritating effects and filters. Recommend for standard editors not for show off."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Everytime showing couldn't create project so please fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Recent update killed the app. Congrats adobe on making me waste all that money,time, and. Effort. Im using a new galaxy mobile phone and now its unable to load project. Save the send your device information and fix your app. Everyone has this issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"this app is not for you with 4k footage or heavy material. i have no problem with 1080hd shorter material but not responding and freeze with 4k footage eventhough it is only 2 minutes footage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love It"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Useful, very simple but works üòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Definitely a pro mature app for mobile video production."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app since Oct 2019 until August 2020. I enjoy using the app to edit videos and very much love editing on-the-go. However, the suffers many bugs from in-and-out audio while playback, unable to fetch projects, crash when opening the app, not able load files, etc. This is very disappointing because Adobe Premier (dextop version) is fantastic and Rush is the opposite. I went ahead and un-subscribed. Hopefully the app matures in the coming months. Thank you."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My projects aren't even loading, now I'm stuck at the loading screen, nothing to do."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great easy way to edit my videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"On the go using my phone with this app I can edit videos faster and have more content up sooner for my channel @taddydigest"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stopped working. Froze."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best thing that's ever happend to adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's a pretty good and helpful app for quick video editing. But my experience was really bad with the rendering and final output. Every time it renders some kind of flaws like glitches video, cut down audio or sometime make the video slower or faster. Didn't get a good render yet."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Complete trash, keeps crashing even with brand new Pixel 3."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Infinite loop upon ""Fetching Projects"" -- could never use the app. Garbage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After download, I am unable to start any project. It just doesn't work on my Oneplus6T."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It was very good to use compared to other apps. But it started to crash suddenly deleting all work and now it is even showing an error to even create project. Worth while using but isn't working anymore."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I love premiere pro in desktop. but, kinemaster is better in android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"When the app use to work I loved it. But ever since the most recent update. I can no longer use it. Get stuck opening saying ""fetching project"" and does not load anything. I try to start a new project it says it can not do that either. Please fix it. I am also a paid subscriber so that isn't an issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I lossed my 155 mb. I hate it because when opened the app, it says that can't load image. I didn't expect this from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use! Also allows downloading!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If I import videos It the video does in it display in the screen it plays only audio it shows black in colour"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is a terrible app dont get it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"AWESOME ‚ù§üíõüíöüíö"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I think this is the best video editing app I've come across on android phones. We need more features to be added though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Damn. When I read the reviews I was like ""man they trippin"" because most of them were one star but when I actually used this thing I was so angry the app makes the video glitch to make it unwatchable the app is great for editing because it's user friendly and really simple but when you export it you are gonna lose your mind Adobe fix this it has been going on for months..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Was a bad experience for me. Been looking for an alternative while my main editor app keeps crashing. But this is just the worst. Was Exporting my hour long video, waited for 5 or 7 hours for it to say it couldn't save the video. Had 15gb of free space for 5.7gb worth of file said my storage was full. Maybe until this gets fixed I won't use this. Probably gonna stick with my main editor since it finally got good."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Uploading media files to create a project leads to a 'Error - Could not create project'. The apps rendered unusable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Repeatedly crashes. GUI not intuitive. Buggy and awkward. Android version is a woeful partner to the desktop app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I just updated the app and now it won't let me upload any video, it says error - could not create project - please help me out"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not very user friendly. Editing and trimming clips is not easy. Lots of other basic features in another app I've been using that are not in this one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excelente, facil e intuitivo. Lo malo es que no tiene mucho material gratis"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hi is this app not compatible with ANY of my devices? Pixel 4XL Tab S4? What is is compatible with?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A lot of control at your hand"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was using this app like a month ago, worked perfectly. But now it's totally broken. First I tried creating a project, video was stuck at first frame. Cleared cache, update app and it's populating that there is an error creating project. Thank you, but I'll look for better alternative.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I would leave a 4-star but now everytime I try to create something it says error"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Upon first use, I actually rather liked the app's UI. I only started using it with a free trial via TikTok, but I was actually considering seeing if I could budget for it in the future. However, every time I've tried to use it since, it has not loaded properly. I've tried using wifi, data, going outside, etc. and I cannot get the app to load properly. I am quite disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Soo good. I never got a good app or thought of an idea to edit my video's. FINALLY, I gave this a shot and I made it work. Works pretty good in my opinion. üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App just stops rendering and crashes plz help I need to upload a video for my channel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I need to zoom into my working title, it s too small"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editing experience"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"THIS APP IS THE WORST ITS A SCAM READ THIS IF YOUR ABT TO DOWNLOAD DONT GET BEAT.LY INSTEAD"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great service"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Needs chroma key"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Omg. Where the f have I been... Kaizen. Excelsior!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love editing IG Stories with this tool. You don't have to pull out the big guns to make a video recorded on your phone look pro!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Force me to login to make sure I don't use your app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome for turning regular footage into memories."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tried to install the app. It kept hanging saying ""fetching projects"""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its good I just think creative cloud for it should be free because I lost like 15hrs of work cause of a bug :P"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even work enough to make a project"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just trying it but appears to be a useful editing tool."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I can't export my video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"great..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I am Happy Use this Rush Application For Video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really the app itself is good, it's just every time I try to use it I have to spend 20 minutes dealing with my adobe account because it won't accept the password that is the correct one, or it can't find it, or something. There is no rush to editing a 5 sec video when I spend 20 minutes screwing with adobe. Incredibly frustrating and the reason I no longer use this app. Please leave my credentials alone. Or just let me reset the password to what it was supposed to be in the first place."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"4 stars cause I have to pay to access all the edit options. Otherwise I've been impressed with how easy it's been to edit on my phone. I can see how SM influencers can use this for on the fly IG edits. It's great for someone looking to jump into video editing but for my editing needs its more of a fun toy to play with while bored"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, but for whatever reason I get ""could not import media"" when trying to place a picture on the timeline..looking for a fix."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app... Please increase the size for editing the video like other apps for example effectum app...So that video is visible in big screen what changes we have done... Else it's awesome ü§ü"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Awful crashed during the tutorial great first impression..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better than the rest"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty intuitive video editor. Not a ton of effects. Nice for straightforward storytelling."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I FREAKING LOVE IT üíò ‚ù§ üíï üíó üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Only experimented on a couple of videos and seems very good so far. A lot of features to get used to."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The greatest editing software! Obviously its ADOBE!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Video audio mixing .......... Where it is.?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"User experience could be improved a bit to be more friendly but once you get to know the app, great for quick video editing on the phone, works great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Crashes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great. Just a little slow."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Its realy good app for fast video projects .. but it is giving me hard time to change the text and it is not supporting Arabic fonts .. i have downloaded one but the words comes with separated letters .. please fix Arabic font and install more Arabic fonts in the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best of all free video editing apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Add reverse option for videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Won't render. Crashes on S9+ S20 Ultra 4k, was working fine then the update crashes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Outstanding options for video editing on phone with ease of use, more you explore the more options you will found. Awesome app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The app itself is fine, I have no quarrels with the features or the look and feel. However, there are two main reasons this isn't a good app. 1: the final video after rendering is frankly terrible. It glitches and blacks out at random places to an unwatchable degree. And 2: when rendering, it can sometimes cut out for no reason whatsoever and make you render again, of which the render itself is ridiculously long - over 20 minutes for a 1 minute video. Please fix, Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best only one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use and nice and quick, some video freezing and stuttering while importing maybe add something to indicate the progress or when it is fully loaded. But a very good free app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Amazing interface!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app is alright its just I wish a green screen setting or like a color key option was available"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Im not the type that would pay for the app as I am a very casual user, but on those rare times I do use t its been very good, the colour effects and speed controls are just what I want and rendered files are of outstanding quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Got to buy the app to be able to save your video and or shared. Nope trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Timing of the sounds is a little off when I'm editing on mobile. It skips a lot. Nevertheless, I love this app. It's easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Having the ability to import media to a clip bin, rather than directly to the timeline, would make this much more useable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Audio is always out of sync with the video by a quarter second after exporting. Very frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Not quite as fully loaded as I would like, but still a great little app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Helpful app, much better than other ones I've tried"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Easy editor and has a lot of good features. However, the preview window stutters every time. And I literally mean everytime. Sometimes pausing it and resuming fixes it, but 80% of the time it will continue to stutter no matter what. Ruins the whole thing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Requires creation of an account so they can flood you with unsolicited ads and requests. Very disappointing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"IT KEEPS CRASHING WHENEVER I RENDER A VIDEO! IT'S SO DISAPPOINTING!:("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Best Editing software, Thanks for this Wonderful App, But one more option is missing That is Chroma key, Green Screen remover Please Add This Option. But the Editing software is Nice."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, simple to use. Adobe is the best as always."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not great. Can't even add your own music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app for editing on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Poopoo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, but lacks transitions. I pay for the premium app, so you would expect there to be more/better transitions from an adobe product. Love the app, would give a 5 star rating if it weren't for the lack of useful transitions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, I hope you guys add more free features. I absolutely love this app so much! Thank you for having it available for us!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need important .. UI and cut and paste adds songs adjustment .., video trimming and tuning eta"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Didn't download....."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Better from all editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have rush on my desktop and its brilliant, was really pleased when the android app arrived but it doesn't work properly on my Samsung A41. I get sound but no picture, all the permissions are given to my camera and microphone. I have a paid Adobe photo plan, so its frustrating and hope it gets fixed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple app with no watermark. I love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Audio and video almost always desynced"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Add options to manage my own text please. Add reverse speed option."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's absolutely a breeze to use and there's a lot of YouTube videos if you get lost. I gave it 3 starts because it won't allow me to export from my phone in 4k or 1080."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is cool!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's too simple. I can't highlight groups or type in precise adjustments. Still can't replace my laptop when editing mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love this app :3"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A lot of editing tools for a free mobile app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very very impressed, great app, very intuitive, however the premium seems a bit expensive for me this app may readily worry to pay for somebody that makes money out of videos. Great app though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best ever and soo easy the best thing its totally free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn, no watermarks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sob"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"4k export keeps crashing before it finishes the export process."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Till now the best app for video editing in phone. Now I prefer editing here rather than on my laptop."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I was trying to make a video and it had a ton of black dots everywhere on the screen :( I would rate it zero if I could"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"very complicated to work. no simple ui or options for trimming, cropping etc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Works sometimes, audio has skip issues."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works really well, I would suggest a powerful device though"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"it's okay to use but premium version it's too expensive. there's no fade in and fade out tools for music.its so shameless things for organizing this app.üòÖ mainly that thing i really don't like"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No option to run multiple videos in single frame"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love adobe‚ô•Ô∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"im about to export the video and suddenly it crash. never taught that would happen. fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I am editing... It freezes... And nothing will work... Y.??.... Fix it and I'll give 5 star."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Customer service was completely useless. Adobe claims it is not responsible for giving me a refund when it is your product! Not Google. I thought buying a new laptop would fix the problem with my videos being corrupted. Instead I couldn't even download it to my new laptop even though it matches every requirement on the list!."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I'm enjoying using the app! I've been using the pro version. I have a few problems tho. Every so often the app will crash and I'll lose a bit of my progress. One big problem I have tho is when it DOES crash, I end up losing ALL of my clips that I have zoomed in causing me to have to reset the zoom every single time. It's really annoying and tedious. Please fix this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its sucks ass"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Requires an account. Automatic 1 star."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"At first it was a bit irritating as I was limited to exporting just 3 videos on my account but now that they've removed that restriction it's very useful as other apps don't come close as far as UI is concerned, very easy to use and all the features come in handy, But they also removed the cloud sync feature which was existing before when the export was limited to 3 videos, just that seemed to bother me but not to a great extent, it's a great app for beginners to get started with the basics."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Adobe is best in every aspect üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app was great with only tollerable glitches. But now all the media I load into the app has no video on my sequences. I need to see the video to edit it. Also it's impossible to access my media in a sensible way that's organized when doing it through the app. Hope it can improve soon"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slowest Piece of Worthless trash (****) don't pay money. Takes about 10 minutes to just rotate and cut a video nothing else added. This is on my phone oneplus 7 can't imagine on a slower phone."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's not working in android 10 oppo Reno 2"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Cool mobile app. The fact I had to tap around to figure out how everything works was kind of annoying and time consuming. It would be cool if there was a tutorial to break down all the little features as well as be able to save your presets so you don't have to go through the whole process again with another project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best but you should unlock all premium"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"So bad the glitches vert often happens for example the video is not working when i add some music into it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not compatible with Samsung Tab S6. Makes no sense how a powerful Android tablet that can take full advantage of this app doesn't have the ability to even have it installed but other mobile Android phones that aren't necessarily as powerful (Note 8) can. Dissapointing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've only successfully exported once after trying multiple times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every time I try to download this app it gets all the way to end and looks like it's completed and then a message comes saying Adobe Premier Rush is not able to download and yo try again later. Why does this keep happening?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good app. Really appreciate it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best app for video editing in 2020. High level of editing in free. App leaves no watermark in edited video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"simple yet powerful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and professional! A great competitor to Apple iMovie and much more comprehensive in function."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Would be even better with AR filters"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never seen an app crash in my phoneüòÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very Glitchy, Slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent editing, infact best among all that I have tried, even better than the subscribed versions of other apps. Only thing is I can't find a music to add."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Deleted my project. Hours wasted making edits just for the app to crash and delete all my progress. Dont bother upgrading either. POS of an app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is very smooth video editor .I like to edit with this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes alot."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I'm giving this app 2 stars because it has great features, lots of cool things to edit the video, but when you try to export the video the program crashes on you. It kept crashing on me and restarting even while editing the video. It would be four stars if it wasn't for that.....but what good does an app do you if you can't do anything with the video after you are done editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome one after the Premiere pro CC!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, especially good for editing from your phone. Its lacking some functions but makes up for it in convenience and ease of use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"So good yet not so good...I honestly find it so easy to use and was about to love it until it started crashing and glitching every 5 seconds!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor ever its so easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Unbelievable üëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Keren banget pokoknya memudahkan untuk ngerekam video, tapi kalau mau ekspor berkali2 harus berlangganan, doain ada duit biar bisa berlangganan"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"PLEASE ADD THE REVERSE FEATURE. LITERALLY SNAPCHAT HAS IT BUT NOT THIS APP ü•∫"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its top slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Might be better, I just started using it, will see..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thinking about Paying the $9.99 a Month! So far so good. Very easy to use and very fast!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So Easy To Use Or To Edit Gaming Videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app needs more features to be added as the new features are coming daily in other apps."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Favorite editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"ü§Æü§Æ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately when I signed up for apps paying for them the app never loads once opened and refuses to allow me to begin any projects gives me an error and shuts down. Waste of my monthly subscription!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome and works so well on the phone too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It works, didn't crash and let me cut a series of clips together easily."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to figure out. Wish there was a rotate option for video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"At first it gives well experienc but for next time it don't works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot export my video. Tried everything"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Too good app üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"worst editing app ever, lagging my phone, poor interface, do not install this app waste of time."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Almost never lets me see the preview so it's blank as in trying to edit and when I export the final video is almost always messed up at the end."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great mobile editing but all my videos are changing contrast when imported. It looks like the contrast and brightness levels are jumping up and down randomly during the video. That makes the app unusable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy to use Rush. It's great apps that integrate with PC and mobile. Easy to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There is no search function to find the media you want to include in your project. It makes the app unusable. ""Here's a list of all the audio or video on your device, go find the song you want yourself."" They do all this work putting together an otherwise great app, and they totally kneecap themselves by not including an extremely basic feature. ADOBE, HOW HARD IS IT TO ADD A DAMN SEARCH FUNCTION?!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app out there right now. Thats a fact. S10+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great! Great for anyone who like their apps crashing every 15 seconds"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love Adobe and I love this app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Thank you for making a simple easy to use app üòÅ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video playback is a miss. Especially after after changing colors, saturation, contrast, temperature ect. Can't play Video on mobile devices. I was using a galaxy note 9 and galaxy S20 plus."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Let me do x without signing up"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I am trying to purchase the premium feature but it's not accepting my debit card details, strangely it doesn't have paytm or google pay options too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, very useful, like most of the Adobe products üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I was working on a video for past 2 days and anw when i want to render it... app crashes and says some error occurred please open project again, i tried many times but the scenario didn't change. Please help."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"TY!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Output video is laggy jittery video, on a highend phone! There is a codec issue with some videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Buggy app no transisitions effects choose from 3 only what is this ??? no option of layers"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not freindly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Total time waste, I did few edits on a small video recorded on my oneplus 7t and exporting that simple video became more of a task than editing it. First of all the edit review window is so small and you can't even zoom it to see better, not even in landscape mode. Not a well designed app for a phone. Also main issue is it took 6 hours even on my oneplus 7t to export a video of 50 seconds but the output was total waste with missing inbetween frames and jittery video output."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app sucks 8 a month to use this sucky editing app when I can't export anything I hope the creators get stabed and killed i want a refund"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy simple and awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Couldn't trim video small enough or by time code."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stupid ü§¨"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App getting hanged....even though it's updated"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very demanded but worth it. Should optimise more though. I mean currently 865 is the latest one and I'm on 845 but the app shouldn't freeze for me, it's still a flagship processor from 2 yrs back."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"For a while I thought that I had found the best and the smoothest mobile app for video editing.....but turns out it starts crashing like crazy...... honestly disappointed...I'm using a OP7t and honestly wasting expecting it to crash as soon as I go above the 2 minutes edit time on the timeline it starts crashing and the preview window gets stuck!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It wouldnt let me put in my email"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good keep going"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constant crashes when doing anything. Especially exporting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good aap"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not that user friendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"App keeps crashing no matter what size file I work on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like this apps very much. Very helpful to edit video...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"God, i love this app. Couldn't ask for more. Working on this app feels easier than working on my laptop which has filmora9. It's my second time when I'm writing a review on this app. I seriously love it:)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Seems good at first, but when it comes to rendering/saving the video, half of the footage is frozen and doesn't play just the sound plays, and it takes forever to do the rendering. Using the app on a brand new Sony Xperia 1ii which has very good specs so I see no reason for it being so bad. Must just be a poor app design"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fairly easy to use!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Finally one good and intuitive app. Can improve more. Slow mo n stuff ll make more good sense into the platform"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I initially installed it, and did the little tutorial. I was impressed by how easy the layout was and simple to use. However. Beyond the tutorial, now that I really wanted to use it, its just errors out the wazoo. Unusable. Really unfortunate."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for a free app üòÅüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Quality editor. I enjoy it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Great app but won't let me export, says media missing when it clearly isn't, so I wasted hours editing a video for nothing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It's lagging üòí"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"While I was editing the videos, I had no complications, the editing was smooth and easy as it should be but when I was trying to export the video, I kept getting the prompt, ""Some Error Occured."""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst adobe ever, you have to upload every file. Which mean if you created a video of 2 gb and u have a slow internet. No chance, wait for 5 years for the clip to be generated"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very Buggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app crashes and barely works. I'm a paying Adobe member and this app asks me to become premium user every time I open it. But that's not even the worst part. It just crashes no matter what. It's incredibly unstable and unusable on Android. Be prepared to make tiny projects because anything else and you risk losing all your work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best Video Editor Appüòò‚úåüèª"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"From what I've seen so far, it's more straight-forward than previous tried video editors. Surprisingly, it's faster too, at least for the simple edits that I use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashing on start and when pressing import media"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waise of time... Not working in my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I don't recommend this app it is glitchy I might use it though but it does annoy me that you cannot add your own music and you cannot delete sounds you have made and I do not like the quality."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Im learning it's really good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Laggy on my high end device. Nvm"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering time is very slow. It takes too much time for even small videos. For one project I want to wait 2 to 3 days to complete."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Audio converter is not available"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"A total waste app... i was so curious about this app before installing it.. but after installing it i became yo know that this app is created for beginners only. There is nothing like pro in it. Specially it works very slow.. Totally disappointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is really really well made for mobile comparing it to Premiere Pro on PC. I am really impressed by how easy it is to use and how many tools they were still able to leave in! Obviously, my phone takes about 7-8x longer to render & export but it works great for shorter videos when I'm on the go and need to put something together relatively quickly. Awesome, awesome job Adobe. You cRUSHed this one! üòÅ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seems pretty good so far easy to use"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Please fix some bugs(video glitch, video playback stuck, app not respond) in android 10 and also please add customize resolution features otherwise excellent app in my mobile (OnePlus 7T), Thank you"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Can't export anything without it crashing. Crashes randomly even sitting on the projects screen. Waste of $10"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App crashes every time I try to create a new project. Won't load previous projects anymore either. I used to be really happy with this but it's quite glitchy at the moment. Happy to change my review once these bugs have been fixed :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst Editing App POS"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App freezes and crashed while editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really easy tool to edit videos on the go."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"why doesn't the app let you trim videos?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"5 stars best app I've ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"amazing. it is user friendly, free, and overall amazing. there are a lot of features that can be detailed but are quite easy to access and use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like the app but look at YouTube to understand it better"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I tried to adjust the audio speed to match the video its glitched and it keeps happening no matter how many times i do it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Big fan, so much easier just editing on my phone instead of transferring files to my computer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just wanted a simple video editor, should have expected this wouldn't be it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Having a higher end phone where specs are good to catch up with this app bt still facing lagging problem are after sometime the app just pauses there and I have to restart the app. Now the video is not even rendering. My whole work is going to be destroyed. This wasn't expected by abode ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I've been looking for."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is awsome. I gave the app 10/5"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Greatul"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please fix the glitch! App won't go past the ""fetching projects"" page. This used to be my favorite editing app, but now its useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Would be nice to render 4k"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Otimize it for Galaxy Tab S6"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy editing, hopefully it has reverse clip function"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super app hai..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Audio keeps stopping or gets jittery when I play the video. Same goes with the video itself. The whole just goes laggy."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's really good to use might get confused at the controls at first but one of the best video editing apps out there. So You need awesome? Then get it ‚úå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Every 3 minutes the app crashes and I have the s10+."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Extremely slow, when I upload videos I only get audio just a horrible experience overall couldn't even put up with it for a couple of minutes without contemplating on blowing my brains out."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have spent 2 hours on editing a video and when I am trying to export it, it's crashing again and again. Complete mess."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app started off okay. It was easy to edit and simple to use for quick short projects, but it has since went downhill after about 3 projects in. At this rate I can no longer effectively edit videos without it glitching and crashing within 2 minutes of opening my projects. I'm so over it. Do not install this app. This is highly disappointing for Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely üòç"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for smartphones but keeps on freezing unresponsive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The worst app. I have a Note10+, a nice mobile, but EVERYTIME the app turn off repeatedly. I need to render the video whenever I want to see it as it is, because if I leave it to watch on the screen where you edit it, it will have too much leg."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its very glichy with audio, dont not recommend using this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful app, easy to use as well!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible first impression with this app. Tried to create a clip under a minute with 5 clips shot natively on the phone (Google Pixel 3XL), playback is jittery and app constantly crashes. Tried reinstalling a handful of times to no avail. Will probably look elsewhere for mobile video editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's interactive, and there is a learning curve for sure. I'm 60, and not as tech savvy as most. If the icons would indicate what they are when you hover over with stylus would be a huge help. Having fun learningüôÇ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"There is no pip"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Easier to use. Saves time"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"""Rush"" just on the name since it's not that fast to use compared to the previous app (Premiere) or other apps such like Quik. Hoping for a more easy to use user interface, ideal for the purpose this app was meant"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb quality üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Lags way to much"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"still needs some work because the app keeps crashing from time to time ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app üëç very nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I never rate videos, but this program is a mess. Steep learning, even if you're familiar with full Premier, and the app is aimed at tablets, not phones. If you're trying to add a simple watermark, be prepared to jump through 10,000 unnecessary hoops. Everything has to be constantly rescaled. This is not optimized for mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Needed to edit a few clips together and this does a great job at mobile editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Need an audio transision"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It keeps closing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It takes too much time for rendering. plz make it fast. Video breaks sometimes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for editing short videos for IG etc.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing! Best free editing app on the market hands down, better than the premium ones too, don't bother buying them just get this app!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is just trash, it's extremely hard to work with, and it usually doesnt work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good at basic editing and it would be great if you include audio transitions too"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why this app is not available on the tablet samsung s5e?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Solid app, takes a little long to piece together short videos on the s8 plus but it's still effective."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good for Edition video great quality"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a very good video editing software for mobile."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome, easy to use, and free."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Add audio option Other option's are excellent!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It is compatible with my old OnePlus phone, but not my new Samsung Galxy S20 Ultra?!?!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible and so user unfriendly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"My phone is blazing hot. It's not old at all, not an outdated model trying to keep up with this app. I've never felt my phone overheat this quickly (5 minutes into opening). The project I was working on wasn't even strenuous; it had seven three second clips. The app also crashes when I go to play my project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Suck app!!! Last time able to use on my Samsung tablet, now not available anymore"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Supperrbb easy app like primiere pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Big red flag when the program throws a ""can't create project"" error during the first 10 seconds of the tutorial. Project won't load after editing and closing the app. Lazily coded and is an absolute waste of time. Note 10+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I would like to send the slide show to someone that has the same phone I have an Android. How do I make this work?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very happy! Amazing, easy to use features and no ads or pushes to buy the premium version!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app so far üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I dont want to pay monthly to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best phone editing app ever fr früòÅ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The video stays blank which makes it impossible to make cuts and add transitions. Please fix this issue."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"By and far the most confusing interface I have ever used. Why would export be under share. Why is there no indicator to know the toolbar scrolls. As far as design is concerned I knew what I wanted to do and it took me 3 times longer to complete my work cause this is a nightmare interface. Rush might not be the best description for this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Just perfect for youtubers like me. Very much helping to me. Just a problem that it cannot sometimes makes some glitches in my edited videos but that is not a big deal."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sexy app baba"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's simple and does the job."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"DON'T WASTE TIME IN OTHER APPS LIKE I DID, THIS IS THE APP YOU NEED!! You should pay the free version! The free version is so complete you can't imagine how much you can do with it! The interface is so easy to use you can skip the tutorial and still make it. I suggest everyone to get this app asap for video editing! The quality of the video output is incredible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why this app is not compatible with my Redmi K20 Pro? I was using for quite some time but after some days it stop working, also stop showing in play store."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"First time using Rush on my phone. After many hours of editing, my project just doesnt load. Ok, so I check online and realise I need to reinstall. So I log in, save my progress, and reinstall. And boom, after I open the app and log in project is gone. Hours of my life on that. Absolute bollacks, would not recommend this app at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not very pleasing. Everytime I try to use the application it crashes. I use a phone with a Snapdragon 855 chipset so I don't think compatibility should be an issue. Please fix this ASAP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love all Adobe features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It has good tools and worked really well a few months ago, but recently its been really slow and crashes after 1 or 2 minutes of working on a video. Tried researching how to fix it but it seems other people are having the same problem :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Adobe can burn in hell for all I care"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Pretty good app a few rendering issues but overall pretty good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The free version has all the basic tools, and it works fantastic. It's perfect for casual video editing. It even comes with a built in tutorial which makes using it it so much easier. The premium version has way more tools and the price is fairly reasonable for what you get. The only thing I would like better is if the free version had a few basic shapes to work with. Even without it though this app is definitely worth it. You just can't beat free Adobe software!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work properly, crashing after 20 seconds everytime üëé uninstalling"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"the experience is good but with the slow-motion need and some ... More effects"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even start up"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Video did not render , I tried many times. Also edited my video many times again and again .Also the customer care execute was not able to understand the problem and help .I am so much disappointed, also I think it did not worth a single penny for it's subscription. 820rs is a waste for this . I am so much disappointed with the service and the service executives. Also wasted my precious time .I would suggest that the developer shouldn't have launched the application if it's not working"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is complete waste of time, it doesn't make anything easier and it's because of this reasons.... (1) The video can't people edited in landscape (2) The clips can't be moved faster (3) Music breaks during editing (4) There's no options to fade in & out (5) Transitions make the video lag (6) While moving the clips you can't identify when or when to drop it (7) If the clip is small the gesture of long press will trim it when you are trying to move it.... These are few of the problems."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It very good app for editing video. I really like it."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Incredible"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I recently download and it always crashes. Worthless at the moment. Using Pixel 3 XL."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's sad really because this truly is the best video editing app for free. However after a while it no longer will load any projects or allow you to start a new project. I hope they fix this bug because this truly was my favorite app."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rush worked well enough at first, but then right as I finished my project it corrupted my file, prompted me to redownload said project, then wouldn't let me and five hours of work was lost."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"App is well made, fast and usable on mobile devices and laptops, and can be transferred to premiere any time."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Usefull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good app but. But saving videos just trashes the quality down to 720p. Are living in 90's? Who the hell see 720p. When u post that 720 on social media, it looks like 144p. Total garbage of all hardwork"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"If its working cool, wont export to desktop, at all...however its the desktop version thats the most infuriating. Here it is, a product i *would use religiously..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The update keeps crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Think of it as Premier for mobile. Free trial, subscription, the whole 9 yards."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"End level mobile video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For me best video editor"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow,....not even opening"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This apps is really good. It's easy to use"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very dander applications"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best app i found for video editing. The only missing thing is lack of transitions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very good to use but little expence to get more option"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"1 major problem. When editing the audio cuts out after 5 secs of playback. Making me have to pause the video and play it back. Also audio tracks take for ever to load."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not worth to have Adobe rush on your phone. Struggles to render all the time. Not a single video was rendered and exported. Regret paying money. App crashes during editing and exporting."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Literally the best and easiest video creator and editor out there. No crazy advanced settings, but more than enough to make dope videos. I'd give more stars if I could!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible, I prefere use other editors. This one have bad clickable experience, the worst layers and don't accept gif photos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My money lost always hang not good experience mot improves needed"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very helpful and easy. I previously gave 5 star but after update it doesn't work at all. So Zero star."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic things"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really clean experience. I prefer it to using a full editor on pc for memes and random stuff for fun."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Issue with Adobe and H.265 footage. Same issues on Premiere Pro on PC. Unusable, which is disappointing as a full CC suite member. Crashes when attempting to expand timeline, move videos. Can't report a bug either, won't let me use the drop-down to choose a question. Pixel 3 XL, 6 clips, 4k footage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Quite useless. Lack of normalization and lack of ability to add subtitles :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waste of time. Try to export single 30 sec video will take hours and it won't finish too worst from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"In Oppo Reno 2f Does not Work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app. It a lot selfexplaining task"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Really not great. Needs a lot of work by Adobe to remove all the bugs. If you want to do just 30 seconds of video editing then it's ok but for anything remotely significant it's not good. The most recent update seems to have given it more bugs than it had before. Needs some serious fixing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The sound lags and crashes sometimes ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need options to edit rgb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"so amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Embarrassing release from Adobe. Constantly crashes on open. Constantly crashes on export. I spend 5 minutes editing my video and 45 minutes trying to export it. Who gave this release the green light?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I use the premiere pro in my desktop and i found this kind of a portable one. Works very well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fast and easy. ü§ò"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exporting a video project with a song added only makes the song glitch, choppy, and jump around. I hate it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for quick video edits!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The features are bit of lacking, and there is no effective way to tell eactly how much of a clip did I trim out and how much is left. Instead I can only guess from the total length of the video."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app can't seem to find my .mts files."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Enjoy editing anywhere"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's really good especially for just being an app. It really heats up my phone but that's expected. My only complaint, and a pretty big one at that, is oftentimes when I render and export a video, it leaves the exported video with permanent little skips and lag spots in it. It's really frustrating. Usually I have to export a video multiple times to get clean final product."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just does not function well"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant install... Ok"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Been a paid subscriber for many years. Disappointed and Adobe surprised. The app slows the sound pitch of imported videos. Unusable. Uninstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very laggy.. takes long to open project and fails sometimes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"cool editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I have purchased subscription to edit 4k videos, however the app keeps on crashing while playing video. Also, video keeps on lagging and after sometime the app crashes which is very annoying. It would be really great if team can look into this issue and resolve it at the earliest as being a customer who has only purchased subscription of this app among others present in the market makes me feel to cancel the paid subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love the app shame it crashed a few times."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Finally a tool for advanced video editing on the go"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot export , An unknown error issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"La m√°s parecida alas de PC est√°n muy bienü§ëüëåüèªxd"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Great app, when it works, but as others have mentioned, 90% of the time now it won't even open / work at all on my up-to-date android phone. Plus it's pretty expensive if you want to actually publish more than 3 videos. Very annoyed. Can't access any of my projects - hours and hours of lost work. My other editing apps are getting pretty slick - Filmora is saving me atm. Adobe is getting too expensive (greedy) anyways."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app video editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome application."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"best experience possible for editing on android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Quick, efficient way to make movies. Great work!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not at all Premiun App. Observations: 1. When i open and i get a list projects which i created. It never opens the project in single click, some Ui improvement is required. 2. When i am trying to provide the voice over then i get a chriping voic just like if my sound system are broken. Whereas it is actually caused by recording system in Rush. 3. When i export 4k video, it randomly crashes. I would be cancelling my premium plan as this app is not at all bug free."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best video editor I have ever used .Great functionalities. One major problem I found when working on low resolution videos. When we add low resolution videos for example 640√ó460 videos the sound clarity is loosing..we can't hear the original voice. Voice is lagging and actual voice is not audible correctly. This is happening when we download videos from facebook. It would be good if we correct this problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Super awesome, complex staff but easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Sometimes app crashes on me, but when it doesn't it's awesome"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for a free app, very happy with it. I have never written a review for an app for my entire life if that gives you any indication on how I felt about my experience with Priemere Rush."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loving the experience. Great for doing quick edits on my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't even get it to install on my phone, it's a Samsung A50. The sales guy said that it was the absolute best phone for pictures because that's typically what we would always do with our phones. However, now that I've started to own business I can use all the help I can get. So it's frustrating to not be able to install this app...however I'm not the only one that can't get it to install, others with different phones than me have had issues as well. So it sounds like an issue on Adobe's side."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Very little features for the price, other apps have a lot more and are free."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome video editor and so easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, but after the recent update the app crashes when trying to load projects on startup."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super... keep it up adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App hasn't been able to load my projects for a month now deleting and never downloading again. Lost countless hours of video editing to this app. I don't reccomend"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"helpfull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor, so easy to use Love it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It used to suck with no tablet support and limited exports, but they are finally giving some love to tablet owners without CC subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I love Adobe and their creative cloud. I wish these apps were around when I was younger."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelent app"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It is good but lacking some features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This application is wonderful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"GOOD application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Awesome editing app! The tools & capabilities are great, but the constant crashes (and lost work) are a deal-breaker. Would easily be 5-star if the app were stable and could finish what it promises. Update: when the app works, it is excellent. I really want to upgrade to Premium, but unwilling to pay for a product that isn't reliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect for creating content from my phone. Very user friendly and is compatible with my Adobe CC."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm a animator and I was.looking for a editing program and its.good but I would like more image options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Does the trick for basic edits. Chopped mistakes out of a 17 minute phone video. Have not tried anything advanced though. eg. Multiple sources, audio tracks etc. but it has the capacity to do all that and more."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Perfect app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Owsmmm no watermark great job"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It allows some share after Adobe not allow to share Please keep it free to share"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"With only 3 export limits I will uninstall this app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I cannot get audio or video to sync up with what is actually exported from this app at all. Also it seems to pick one main chunk of video as the main video for the whole project and if you delete it, regardless of whether you have other video or audio EVERYTHING in the project gets deleted. I'd honestly say even the abysmal built in TikTok video editor is a more qualified piece of ""video editing software"". I don't know who Adobe paid for all these 5 star reviews."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Faster than my computer"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The app has a glitch I think. When I edit my video and set it to render - the app crashes over and over again. It's frustrating because my work worth 2 days is on hold. ü•∫"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Whoa"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Since iMovie is not available on Android, I downloaded Adobe Rush to make a short video project for school. It worked fine at first, but now anytime I open the app, my ""projects"" page fails to load and becomes stuck in an infinite loop. Not to mention, whenever I try to create a project and upload videos or pictures, an error pop-up appears. Maybe it's just my device, but I expected better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The rendering time takes ages and still end up the app crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Super easy but reviewing the video while editing strutting makes it to get on nerves"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Life saver"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Game Changer love it !!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love this app and it is good for editing but I want to ask only one question that why this app is not able for landscape mode in mobile"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very Nice Appüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best app thanks creator lots of love"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't export my video... I can't even upgrade to premium to export the video. What a waste of time!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I wish I could reverse video clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good app, i really enjoyed working with it. Layers and other feachers are good enough for editing videos for youtube or else"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This a gd app üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Trusted app and flexible, just that audio control can be enhanced. üëç Great job great app!"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app , it's really helpful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I get ""Open production failed"" error. This is after spending hours on a project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Frustrating. The phone app is pretty good. But the reason I got it was to use it on both my phone and PC. The PC version has proved itself to be quite a pain. I completed a video after 20 hours of efforts and at the end I got a H.264 codec error. Firstly, couldn't find a clear solution. Secondly, tried every resolution possible and it still wouldn't export. Now the application hangs each time I hit the share button. As an admirer of Adobe, I am sorely disappointed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app and easy to use! The only issue I run into is when I'm rendering a video, Iv recorded 4k 60 fps vids and when trying to render it on auto or on select 4k 60 fps/4k frame rate matched it always cuts my video short. Not sure if it's a glitch. Had to render it in 1080p. But other than that solid app and would recommend üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and easy to use. I like it. üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use app. Highly recommended at all. Just watch the training lesson and you are an expert video maker"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I recorded a video on my Note9, then tried to import it to the app, the app displayed a message saying ""cannot import video"". I tried different videos from different dates, same problem"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"YOUR APP KEEPS LAGGING FFS!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For now I can say, the best one! I will test it for more :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Very basic video editing to be called ""Premiere"""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After all the editing, you can't render the video to export it. Pointless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"VERY good app for editing videos. Similar to After Effects but for free and with fewer transitions and stuff but it's easy to use. Problem it literally crashes every 2 minutes. Sometimes I cant open the App for about 2 hours because it wont stop crashing directly after I opened it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Hi, I'm having issues with downloading and installing the app. I tried all the steps you suggested in the troubleshooting but nothing helped. Don't know what to do more. Can you assist?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just Woooow üòçüòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It works well but then freezes. It wont let me rename projects that are already started. It gets to the menu but then when you click rename is fails to do so."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great experience! But minor should be added like opacity option Resizing options directly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It was great when I got it, however the day after when i try editing i am forced to close the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It was a great experience using the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Supergood"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It has a sign up issue"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Sorry, but im not using my dob for an app..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Rush is the kind of mobile video editing application that I expect a mobile video editing application should be. At least that's what I think with how things work in Rush. There are layers. There are clips that you can move around. It's intuitive. The essentials are there. Titles, sounds, filters, transitions, they're all there. One star less from a rather perfect score because the video during editing just froze. When played, the audio continues but the video is still. After rewinding the video over and over to see if it helps, it just went to a black screen instead. I had to restart the app. Bad way to get the new users hooked. Nonetheless, my rush project was finished... in a rush. Sadly, but not unexpectedly, there are only three export chances. Once they run out, this user will have to uninstall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Please add Kromakey to the appÿåsimilar programs can work with green curtains, but this program is not possible.üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Very simple and useful, but app getting closed automatically while editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Only 3free use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Works ok, but too expensive for features it provides...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app ever üëå thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I liked"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Is very very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app, simple and high end for a smart phone app. You gotta learn a few things. Btw, I'm a professional editor, and I love not having to transfer phone files to edit simple social media content."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"The only problem I have is with the audio. When I listen to the song I want befire putting it in it sounds perfect. But after I put it on the timeline it will randomly skip small sections and replay small sections and idk how to fix it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Videos can be exported in 60 Fps ... Nice app üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"No chroma key option!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"GUI is very Bad..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always crashing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps that i used and very easy to edit my videos on.lüòä"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good features but not good value. You should offer a one time purchase like you get on final cut Pro X and the cost of your subscriptions is way too high."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Bra"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I actually found it very easy to use. Really like a baby Premierr Pro."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy, intuitive."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor for android ever.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Only 3 videos can we save on our device if we want to go more than that we want to paid for the premium version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I think the developers are Indian.üòä Hey guys üëã Just want to tell you please add noise reduction tool. Because all of us can't buy costly video softwares and don't need extreme perfection in videos just a good quality video which can at least compete high quality videos."

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It is very good ...when it works. However I am having to uninstall and reinstall it every now and again due to LAGGING AUDIO issue. Very annoying. I have even compressed videos prior to importing them to avoid this and still import videos will lag or exported videos will lag. The simplest of videos! I.e a simple vlog style video gad the audio LAGGING. After editing it down and looking forward to posting it the sync is completely off making the video useless. Please fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Feel good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"after editing for 40 min I was impressed everything Was running just fine but it suddenly it stopped at first I thought my phone crashed but premiere was not responding I waited nothing happened so i closed the app and try to run it again same thing nothing happened so I uninstalled and reinstalled premiere. runs normally but I lost what I was working on."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I had a great experience with this app while first I had kinemaster and it didn't work properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All this app does is crash. Completely unusable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"+ One of the best apps for video editing. Wide choice of video color editing parameters, fully adjustable video speed and size/quality. Doesn't reduce the quality when exporting video. - It's a pity there're no special effects. Limited options for text. Couldn't figure out how to add music. The preview video could be bigger. My fav mobile video app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"AWSOME APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nyz app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app for editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Owsm üî•üî•üî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good app but only 3 exports. For non commercial movie maker it's a bit too high. Wanted to add more good reviews but tha 820‚Çπ/ month is a shocker for me.. Nevertheless no worries.. Uninstalling the app. Will find some easy app for non commercial short movie maker like us."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Videos as small as 150mb won't get rendered. What's the point of having such a ""powerful"" editing app then? Pathetic experience."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome! üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Absolutely the best app to edit social media and you tube videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app of the millennium for android."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Ihad a great experience with this application. Good quality and speed manual, settings are very good..I love it"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I used all android apps of adobe and tried too many video editing applications but this one is amazing but it needs some improvements i dont know to how to change the app prientation please help me with that BTW the app is okay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Eadting quality 100% üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm so bad at editing but this is so easy to use and if you think this is a bot look at my channel Tank Lix„ÉÑ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't do anything useful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"This a good app. I only wish that you didn't need a membership to export more than 3 projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good Job üëèüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes 100% of the time while editing on Pixel 3xl.. miss the old version of Premier Clips"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Pretty good for on phone editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"SERIOUSLY??!! This app is buggy as **** and you want money for it?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Strong learning curve knowing premiere and knowing gimmicy phone apps but it gets the jobs done for creating movie with photos and video. 3 free exports is nice. Wish it was free but I get it, gotta pay for quality."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I has like good editing platform but give 2 exports for free and they ask you to pay"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Too little transition options, always says it can't import certain media when it literally imports other media from the same folder/device ( like uploading 2 out of 5 photos from the gallery and not recognizing the other 3)(or uploading 2 or 3 video clips but none of the rest) its bs. No slowmo options or anything cool. It would really be nice to have something similar to premiere pro on the phone bc it would cut the editing process in half"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I rendered video but output didn't come..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Took a minute to figure out but it's great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It was really pathetic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot create a project or even log in"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"How come I can't down load this app on my Samsung galaxy tab s6? Very upsetting"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So functional!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can install gta and complete the campaign before this app can render a 20 second video. Absolutely rediculously slow at rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"When I combine videos and edit them it doesnt show anything it just has audio and it speeds the video up some how"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Takes forever rendering the video, really buggy app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"1. Cannot follow a bug report app broken. 2. Adding a new title to a video - the title cannot be edited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's okay, pretty handy in a pinch but a little difficult to be precise"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The only thing that just doesn't work fantastic in my experience is dissolves. They almost always render out all glitchy so I just stopped using them and only use audio dissolves"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Good I wanted a simple app that lets me split clips shorter than 1s in length. My old app stopped letting me do that so Im glad this worked out. Edit: Nvm forces you to pay to use after exporting three times"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's very cool and esy app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Awful video editor"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"can't install the app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Awesome service product. üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I think this app is really great I enjoy using it one of the best on the market even. Allthough I have been having trouble making my experience with the app displeasing. When I exported a video it messed it up and with only 3 limited exports until you have to PAY for an account and it already messed it up. The app also crashes a lot, I really do enjoy it but these issues make it hard to use. It's all very frustrating."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good intuitive app!! I only have one problems with it, the audio gliches and it just stop working if it is too long"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"One of the best app for video editing"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Needs a feature to adjust the volume, if it already has one I apologise."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Looks good. Loved the tutorial very helpful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Too havy app for mobile devices But good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I just upgraded (paid) for this app. It still says storage full... I don't know what to do. I've tried everything. I think I'd like my refund please."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"There is no simple reverse clip option."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You get 3 exports before they ask you to pay up. It's not really free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Please add a landscape support to the app. Everytime i try to go in landscape mode, it zooms onto video. It would be much more useful in landscape mode."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for app for mobile editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super quality editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Need more transition effects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I was just wondering if this app was taking away from the app store? I can't find it on my S20 Ultra and can only use it on my S10 now. Also, I've had all adobe and love it but this app has been having a few more issues as of late. I know y'all are working on getting the bugs fixed so good luck because I love it when it works."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"How are u even supposed to crop split and cut videos I've been trying for 30 minutes"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't let me install S10 I've tried everything!?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I wanted to love this. I really did. But it had such problems loading my videos into the editor, would play a couple seconds, skip back, skip ahead. Tried mobile AND desktop, did the same for both."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Has bugs! The buttons and other features on the app tend to lock up, then require you to restart the app. The buttons for in-app bug reporting lock-up also, and cannot submit the issue. I gave it 2 stars because I really like the features of the app when it works. Would be happy to increase the score if the issues were fixed and I could actually complete a project. Users: Do a serious test video of all features before dedicating your time to an actual project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love it! But would have really appreciated if they made the use of the app free and not ask to upgrade."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have not been able to edit or view projects and still getting charged monthly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Excellent app but it need some things to correctüëçüòå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering time infinite! I have been trying to edit videos on this app since my workstation isn't working properly. The features are bit confusing but a person can grasp that. What's problematic is that the rendering time is never ending. The render is insanely slow (I'm running 8gb ram). These slow renders make me cancel the export instead. Fix it or the app is useless."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Was easy to use and had a great time editing but after I exported the edited video, the video came out to be extremely choppy and very low quality and was nowhere near usable"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is the best editing app that I have ever seen in Android. I give it thumbs up üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Waited 3 hours while exporting the video. Still rendering failed. It takes too long in processing to export videos. phone hardware is latest (sanpdragon 855, 8gb ram) though. I think this issue needs improvement."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Absolutely incredible bit of softwear. User friendly so easy to manage and edit. Not 5‚òÜ as it keeps cutting the audio out of clips while edditing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"11‚Ç¨ per month for basic features üò≥üò≥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing that it works on my phone. Very cool!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"After spending hours editing a video due to random crashes. I'll find out that it couldn't even render my video and will just keep on crashing. Save your time and download a different editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app keeps failing to sign in. Well I just signed in, it failed, uninstalled the app reinstalled then I signed in and then it worked"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Really amazing experience. Thanks a lot Adobe. But try to reduce the app size. Everything is best."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"500 rs premiere"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Another Great Adobe application ü•≥"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for youtuber...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Seams great"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Professional, Simple, Best app for video editing. Thank youüôè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"5 stars:no water mark and ect"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slow and Glitchy. I use Premiere on my laptop, but the Rush app is terrible. Better off just using a free app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I'm giving this app a 4 star review because the features and functionality is good. I'm taking off a star because I have to export most videos multiple times because glitches during export are very common. Most my videos are 30 second long to 3 minutes."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Right off the bat got a problem with the play button stopping to work after unlocking the phone. Anys right after noticed that the feedback form is broken (cannot choose category). Feels like beta quality, at most. Seemed decent before locking my phone the first time after installing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç Video edting super app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Above my expectations"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So simple to use!!! LOVE IT Thank you Adobe."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good .. application"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't believe Premiere Rush dosen't have the feature to fade in/out of audio or to even zoom in on it for precise cropping - what a shame! ‚òπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic üòçüåπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's amazing app. I suggest to all who want to make short clip for sharing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great editing experience"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Just doesn't render the video!!!! I edit the videos and they take more than 30 minutes for less than 25% rendering. Gets so frustrating over & over again. Not happy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great software"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Hated it, it only used half of the photos I added"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"changes made while editing often reset themselves without any warning, which is very tedious. sometimes an audio issue will occur while editing and you only notice after exporting. also only 5 free exports is a little dissapointing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Only get 3 exports for free, even if you have Adobe account with the program on your computer you can't get more."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing Just like that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Despite amazing UI, the exported file wasn't in sync with what I made (a tiny animation to the beat of a song). Also, you can only export 3 times for free, which is respectable, but something to note. A 5 star app design, 1 star for exports -- 3 stars average."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing job"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Seems like they ""Rush-ed"" the product out. The audio keeps getting messed up if I try to import the audio on top of a separate video file (keeps repreating random beats). I was actually excited to use this app, but there are just a lot of competition out there that do it better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"1 star less cause sometimes it crashes in my redmi note 7"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Needs some bugs fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Ok im not gonna lie i know this app from pc and its the best edit app you will ever seen but the problem is that you miss some stuff that makes adobe the best and its moving the text also moving text frame by frame because thats what makes it app that takes edit serious and i really hope that you add this future so it looks like pc version one also the stickers frame by frame one. Basicly if this app is like pc one i would highly recomand it but for the time it just lools like any other app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Much like the computer program, its quite glitchy and crashes constantly. Cant believe they think someone would pay for such a glitchy app, let alone $10 monthly. You must be insane!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm a youtuber, and i don't have much experiences in editing video,but rushcc helped me so much !!! Thank you üòÅüòÜ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy tools to use, very nice and fast."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best editing app ever"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crash....."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"App is easy to us you edit like easily but it allow you export your video only three times after that you have pay 800 something without pay you don't export videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"All videos you put destroys edited audio in it. Audio mixing is way hard and totally not user friendly. Update: Found worse. I manage to mix the audio to a right timing of the other audio. Now I used transform feature to crop and move those videos as i please, now it destroys my audio like shuffling chorus, verses and refrains lol.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing video editing app. I have never edited a video in my life, and in under an hour, I was adding transitions, professional looking text sliders and music to my son's video. Even though I say so myself, it looks professional to say the least. It's a must have for any person needing to produce quality videos. They only let you export 3 videos for free, then you need to upgrade to a plan that costs 820 ‚Çπ per month, which I think for the features they provide is nominal."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I really hate only being able to upload to social media three times!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Legitimate amazing... but not free."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for quick clips edits and color correction. Enjoy using it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Finally got it to work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It sucks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"gives only 3 free video rendering"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Rendering always failed when the edit are done"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great for a free application üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Nice app for instant edit but need some features like green screen etc. Would be better ."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It dumb"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashing , even shutting off my phone. Garbage app. Imovie so much better. Very disappointed in Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Lost projects and glitches that place media in the wrong place and randomly deletes already finished frames. Not the most reliable, especially after I updated the software to the latest version. For the premium subscription...I shouldn't have to cross my fingers and hope it works."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I only get to get my videos 3 times and the first time I did it, it didnt even pop up in gallery. Response to Davinder, I think it didnt show up the first time is because I exited out of the app but didnt close it because there was the notification thingy when I looked at notifications and I saw that it was still there when I left the app for a little. Once the download to gallery was finished I didnt see it in gallery so I did it again without exiting out of the app and it was in gallery."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It works fine in free trail, After you purchase the subscription you'll just see the app crashing and you can't do nothing even if you have a hight end model phone. I recommend don't go for this....this is just waste of money and time.... Instead go for filmora or something else This app doesn't even have all the required elements in it....WASTE OF STORAGE,WASTE OF MONEY Don't know what developers are doing instead of making this app better."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Does not work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Won't let me login"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This app has many errors. Sometimes it simply stops working. Then i uninstall it and then re install it. Then again after sometime the app starts misbehaving again."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it is a worst app it dosen't open after download i tried so many times i am so disepointed"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why can't one login after downloading?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't even sign in"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice and very helpful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Now I can edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"""Unlimited projects"" but only 3 exports. It's a scam."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst editing app ever created in this whole world"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good apk"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy Pizzy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really well made and comprehensive! My previous comment still stands. However I am having issues with the application that I can't report because the report bug page is not working. Currently my projects will not load on the Projecs Screen, I can't make any new ones and I can't report issues. The ""Issue Catagory"" button doesn't seem to work and I cannot submit an issue without it. This is the second time this has happened after reinstalling the app. (Galaxy Note 10+)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Seems like a cool app except it says it has a free version, but doesn't really. You can export 3 videos total, and then need to pay a monthly fee which isnt cheap. This makes it impractical for the casual user."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This works so much better than I thought it would!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You only get 3 exports unless you pay, and they end up glitching the video, def not using again and will be using a different app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very counter-intuitive. It doesn't make trimming a video easy to guess at, had to Google that. Doesn't hint on the bottom tool bar that it is wider than the screen. I had to Google how to save because the save feature is hidden under share??¬ø I have a paid Adobe account so I don't know if this is free app, but I really hope it is for how poorly it's designed. I guess they call it Rush because of how little time they spent on it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"So, I was like, ""Oh look, Adobe released an app for phone so it might be a good editor for my project,"" but boy was I wrong. It's so hard to edit and move my text around, as well as expanding scenes in my project. Sometimes, it'd decide to just not work and won't let me enter my project, to the point where I panicked because this is my final project, but eventually it let me in. I'd definitely not recommend this app for important projects because this editor sucks, but I finished my project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing features and simple interface"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bad app not sign accourt üòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Can be a tiny bit difficult to work the text feature on your phone but other than that totally worth it!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,",üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"So far it's pretty user friendly I do believe there are certain aspects of the app that could be a bit more display and user friendly but other than that it's elementary."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It didn't even work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Intuitive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"poli Akribo"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Not free"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Is really good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Looks absolutely great until the ol pay a lot for premium. And when you export videos (with or without premium) it will literally drop the quality to a 360p maximum. Don't waste your time with this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fine for what I needed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"You can't search for media which makes finding audio clips painstakingly long."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"The fact that I have limited posts if I don't upgrade kinda makes this thing kinda useless. Not everyone has a bank account let alone money. I would recommend replacing that with more editing tools, filters, and an offline mode."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Had to edit (cut) my audio and video before uploading and making a project. I added a title and couldn't figure out how to take it off... Adding or fixing these issues would be helpful in making a project."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Overall very good But we need more transistion presets. Just the 4 are not sufficient enough."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Old version is than new version it also has less tools and presets"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is the best Mobile video editing app..i just love it..its functions are just like PC..I really enjoyed editing videos on this app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Super slow and buggy. It can't even export a 2 minute clip and I've tried multiple times. App also crashes when editing videos multiple times. Basically usless"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"A best app for my youtube channel You can go and subscribe to Rijan Shrestha Vines"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best of them all!!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Loved the app. Made a story telling video for 1st grade"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Watched a tutorial on youtube and i was good to go. Didn't do any complicated editing on my video but was perfect for what i needed. The other features looks interesting tho."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No optical flow frame blending option."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So many title to play"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"its limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sukaaa... simple pemakaiannya.. banyak featurnya... dan cepat ngeditnya"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I feel like people would install this more if you didn't have to pay for more storage/space to export videos.it doesnt give me a share to YouTube option anymore.and stops after a while"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app, I didn't know anything about editing videos until this app and I learned, I'm not half bad looll"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Great video editor but why pay the outrageous price when VIDEOPROC is a tenth of the stupid price adobe charges and can automatically upscale 1080 to 4k losslessly. Cutting half your work depending on what your doing (hyperlapses!) Seems you have some competition there adobe...catchya"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Not very impressed, needs a preview button on mobile, if nothing else then for scaling reasons, just seems poorly thought out, I've come to expect more from Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good & Easy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü•≥üó£"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Adobe just like every other big company all they want is your money. There's better options out there for less money even freeü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its really annoy for how this apk works , pay to use ?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Enjoyed much"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing the app operates better than expected and offers more usability. However would love to see a stabilizer tool added to help stabilize some clips in post"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"For an App, it's a great alternative for Premiere Pro when you're in a ""rush""."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great features"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"its literally the best editing app. Its simple and easy to use. Everything is straight forward and has more than enough features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Rendering output not good.. colour correction is flickering in output. Video getting blackout in between..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really good app, lots of features. Some controls feel more difficult than they should be, but overall nice."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps cutting off the last couple of minutes of my renders. So loads of time wastage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"You have no idea for how long i have been looking for such am amazing app so easy to use and very good quality Thanks"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Make editing tools like in lightroom it have color mixing which is so beautiful if you add in this app for video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I would just say that there are some better apps available in the market guys. I was accepting something more from adobe as it's been the number one software company"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"So far, it's not going well. I have the full version because it comes with a monthly subscription and I am disappointed. I can't trim the video at all and can't out a title because it won't clear the words title. It's very frustrating because I do t want to have to upload to my cpu to do the work when I'm on the road...i need the trim and split more than anything üò©"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why in the hell do i only get 3 sample videos to edit?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bugs and crashes... Brokenn also on PC :/ Not ok, considering the premium price and the fact that I'm using high end devices to run it. Even worse now with the latest update. (I can't write too much, reviews limit) - Everytime I open the app, it ask me to singup. And it's happening the same on my windows PC. Any app, illustrator, premier PRO, acrobat. Is wasting time pointlessly. - It crashes often, when you open it, when you upload videos and when it can't sync between the cloud and the devic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Smart"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"They ask for money and dont let you export the fiel"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Dont know others but its so easy to trim"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app actually kinda sucks... There are only 3 transitions. I litterly deleted this app right after I got it. It really isn't good. You have to place the transitions. That way it's easy to mess things up. And the way it is set up is really bad. üëéüëéüëéüëéwhy do people keep saying it's good except little bugs. If you think this app is good, you obviously haven't seen other apps. And you like everything but the bugs you give it 4 stars not 5. Honestly annoying people do that. DO NOT GET THIS APP!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I love the app. I use it on windows but I find that when I try to upload videos it is not responding. Makes it very difficult to work with...can you please resolve this.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Takes forever to render the video. Don't know what the problem is. Absolute waste of time. Never renders the video. Tried around 5 times but it's literally stuck at 15%."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app for editing video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Sooooo amazing ‚ù§‚ù§üòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Amazing video editing capabilities.. it's truly a wonderful and effortless editing software. Just loved using it. Just wish we could get some more transitions. Thanks team Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Lots of options."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Free mobile alternative to Vegas Pro"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app if you dont have a computer to edit use this it's the best editing app I've used ‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing on pixel 3 xl"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App didnt work not 1 project and adobe charged me twice for a product that doesnt work!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its OK. imovie is easier to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i cant install in Samsung s9 plus exynos version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst experience. Edited all the video then realized the rendering is not upto mark. It took almist an hour to render 10 percent of a 8 minute video. Phone is Oneplue 7. Cant even blame phone There is something glitchy in the rendering. Please fix that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a nice programme"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing aap for video editing. Edit your video like a pro. It contains a lot of features to ease editing of videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editing app i ever used"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love to edit through phone we need more features to edit"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for me"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Clunky. Asks for too much information then doesn't work. No stabilizer. Audio tracks are in no discernible order."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app keeps charging my card even after I have changed my card information it is stealing my money and will not stop or give me any way to stop it from charging me i will be reporting the fraud of an app stealing money in hard times like these"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Yay...Sony XAVC-S audio issue seems to be fixed. Now...timecode burn in on exports...please!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You can only do so much with this app, it's just too limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Absolutely bloody awful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is very nice app for making videos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It was great I couldn't believe a free app was this amazing. The catch is they only give you 3 free uploads. Then you have to pay."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good for cranking out cat videos, but why no reverse so dumb!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good one for a mobile. Reversing the clip tool would have been better if provided. Audio transitions."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's a tremendous application! one of the best application on phone for editing."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice app but there should be an option for audio editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very useful, especially if you don't have a laptop. Despite some bugs, as crashing and lack of ability to delete some audio files after loading it, does not hurt as much and underrate the app overall."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Voice and video out of sync everytime after export"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Stuck on fetching even after a restart and redownload."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Powerful"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashed. I pay monthly for my Adobe suite. I've used Rush to make beautiful films. Now, it's not loading previous projects and it won't let me create new projects. I tried uninstalling it but now I cant reinstall. I love Adobe products. Disappointed this stopped working."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cant import videos it shows error"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible, crashed my entire phone so bad that I litterally couldn't turn it off and I had to hard reset my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Only had this app for a week. It's pretty straight forward. Ease of use is good. I intend to use it for more pro looking social media posts, thus far it has been able to do that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"All it needs are more options for transitions and ""stickers"" to use along with titles. Like all social media logos as ""stickers""."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great app. But I wish it was free to share."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Takes too much time to upload"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its so good in editing.. but exporting always crashes,plz fix it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Have been enioyin this app so much during trial period until after payment the app starts to lag and always crashed, causing me to redo my projects again. Hope you'll fix the app for better use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Its good....bt the only problem is with its limited export condition"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Good App but it stopped working, it started ""fetching"" my projects but got stocked in the loop. I updated the app but still no results. I don't think the way Adobe wants to charge for the app is appropriate. It may be better if they charge certain amount for certain numbers of exports. I am not willing to pay per month, knowing that I may use the phone app once in a month, maybe twice. That does not matter anymore since the app does not work. A shame, really."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't process audio correctly. Audio and video do not sync up, it's impossible to edit. It's a shame, because if it worked properly this app would be incredible."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I have a top end, brand new, powerful Samsung. This phone struggles to run the app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I've bought the priemer version, but the app says ""you have reached your export limit"" for the free trial.....try and purchase it again, says ""you already purchased it"" wont let me export despite owning it. You can get stuck in a circle and with the free app version despite having paid for the full one"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I am trying to download this app like from three days and download stops at 50 percent and never finishes. I am soo frustrated that i am writing this review which i dont do often ...kindly help"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like it !"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It gets the job done but screws with the videos sizing and it's resizing UI is bad non responsive and choppy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"More than enough facilities for editing in a smartphone! Nice app for beginners. Easy to use. The only thing down side : expensive subscribe fee. 10usd a month. Compare to kinemaster 6usd. üòî"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"i really loved it until it stopped working, refuses to load projects or allow me to start over with a new one. updated it, still won't load. a shame because i had put a lot of work into my project and now i can't access it at all, will have to start over in a new program. also, it advertises transistions and such it doesn't offer, titles specifically. never worked for me. and i was willing to pay for the upgrades to make them work. pretty sad yall...."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ÿßŸÑÿ∑ÿ®ŸäŸÇ ÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Just fantabulous"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It is awesome i just made a YouTube channel and it helps alot"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"It keeps freezing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is very slow and drain the battery very soon, even phone gets heated up"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Great functionality. Unfortunately it's priced at precisely 10 times what I would have been ready to pay!!!!!! 2 stars for affordability!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing for YouTube Videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Wow, this is actually the easiest and fastest video editing app I've ever tried! I'm really impressed that Adobe managed to make an app that's this well designed. Unfortunately, it's quite glitchy 1) the timeline shows the wrong things or blank objects 2) there's a crackle in the audio, both in editing and in the rendered output 3) there's no option to mix wide and portrait videos properly, by full-framing one or the other. If these are fixed, it would be 5-star for sure."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Keep on hanging"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"You get THREE EXPORTS. Most intelligent people will never, NEVER, pay a monthly subscription. I would rather pay a one time $20+ payment. Until they offer unlimited exports for a one time app premium payment, no one I know will use this. I've been using Adobe on pc for over a decade, never a subscription. Get real Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"3 free exports only. There are plenty of apps that are FOC so not sure what's the point to force us to download and try only to find out it's not free. Good app indeed but will go to other free choices that luckily are out there."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Love it. Very flexible. Just wish they have a lite free version"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"ƒ∞ editing my gangsta video on this program . ƒ∞t ridiculous"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worked once then wouldn't load up anymore. Uninstalled then installed it back and now wants an ""email confirmation "" that I'm not getting. And yes I checked spam."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Projects won't load since the last update I have a YouTube channel and can't work on videos now"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app can edit so much even without the need to use a PC."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good app for basic editing. Just wish there was a way to put markers."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I like it, except I've been trying to save the final product and I've hit export, it renders but doesn't actually save to my phone. Have tried 5 times today. Also it doesn't sync clips and footage to my other devices, as I open one of the projects on my computer, many clips just have a ! In a red square."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Hi this appears to be back to working it took about 2 hrs just to have all project loaded correctly in my note 10+ after the upgrade."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Tattiiiiii"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Gonna cancel my membership. Can't even edit or see my previous videos!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app can do nothing besides showing errors sometimes audio doesnt play or video why is it even a video editor üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Requires sign into Adobe services."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to learn.& super smooth experience!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app seen in my entire life. You should probably remove it from the app Store because it's completely and utterly useless. Pat on your back for making such a useless thing which works 0% . Thank you so much for wasting 9 hours of my lifetime because of this stupid app. Never ever recommend this app to anyone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Very buggy limited features...lots of potential though"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"After a brief period of not working on Samsung Galaxy Note 10+, it now works fine, is quick and does exactly what I want."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Superb..üëå"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best always!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I can't able to view the visual on screen when I editing the video.. is there any solution for this problem?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Op app for creater like me who dont have pc or laptop to edit and very easy to use it.üî•üî•"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"My experience is the same as Burt Jenner in the review feed. Used the app once and now it crashes upon start up. Tried to fill a bug report and can't as it will not let me select a category from the drop down. So not the best experience for my 2nd time trying it. I am on a galaxy s10."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Underwhelmed by this app, that was bundled in with Premiere Pro. High on assets, like title options. Low on editing features. Would still use Power Director over this."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use video editing app ideal for beginners or those who need to develop simple edits quickly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"So easy!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nice and super app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"It's amezing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes on my iphone xs max pro 4gb+256gb.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its really easy to use. I just wished it had more sound effects and music."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very nice video editor, with a lot of powerful features."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I didn't use it yet but I already know that it is the best out of the best. Written by huba huba"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Slide show did not work properly, no audio. Difficult to use."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"No words.."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Cannot import common video files Unsyncs audio and video Black frames and frames warping upon export Freezes randomly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Pretty easy to use and very helpfull"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Marvelously"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Monthly fee for a mobile app? Really? It should be free and sort of a ramp to get me familiar with the full Adobe Premiere so when I'm getting more serious about video editing I'll choose that over other apps, but instead it scares me off right at the beginning with the high prices."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"its an professional editing app for youtube videos"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Audio bugs out. What's the point in using an app that wants me to get premium if it doesn't even process audio properly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It's ok but its REALLY laggy"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Crashes and seems quite limited"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Horrible app because i cant even save it to my phone!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best of the best. I love this app so much."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"How many RAM and CPU performance do we need to use this app? Well, doesn't work on my 128/8 Reno 2f. Lagging, black screen."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"spent over a week editing and the video wont export! tried contacting for help but no luck with any suggestions made. so frustrating that ive wasted all my time"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I can't use properly"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"The features seemed nice, so I gave that 2*. However, the app crashes consistently on my Pixel 3. During playback. During cutting & deleting snips. Can't really do anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Why not free?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst app.you can't save video after editing.DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wth was that"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy AF even for a dunce like me!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Media library window. Where you can sort it by date name or duration. To make it more professional. There's a lot of wasted space. I meant when using landscape"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"greattt, love it. although the render is still quite long as long as PC, it still worth for ""RUSH"""
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I dont have money to purchase high end laptops for video editing but with this app in able to produce high quality content on my phone! Well, high quality for me. I was using MS Video Editor on my Galaxy Book 2 and it just didn't have the features I need. Rush is so much better and I can do so much more on my phone than I can do on my Galaxy Book 2! I'm saving up for a better computer and my first download will be the desktop version of this app!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its good but expensive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"App have lots of features but have lots of issues. Video is not rendering properly. Lots of lag while playing the video. Taking lots of time just to add one thing . My phone uses snapdrgon 845 processor."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly ... Really bad app. I have a Google pixel 3 and it crashes whenever I try to export anything. It used to work! Now it's garbage and a waist of the apps crazy monthly cost!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Incredible all. So user friendly!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good free app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Needed to combine short segments into one video, very easy for a novice to figure out basic features quickly."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,".... Such a basic app, limited control and most definitely not worth more per month than my Netflix subscription."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like it. Seems to work pretty good. I always edit with Adobe products on my computer so I like this for my phone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I needed to make a video for my daughter's school project, this is the first time I ever get it any videos. My laptop is not working these days, so I was worried about doing it using my android phone. Rush was A God send. it was super powerful and super friendly and quite easy. I not only quickly put the videos, pictures and audios together, but I also learned to add in animations and layered videos, audios and images. The video ended up very professional, no one could believe this is my first."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Can't move video or sound parts to the left. when I long press on a part, automatically moves to the right, even if I drag it to the left."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Horrible interface It is absolutely impossible to add in audio and perfectly sync with video. Have to upgrade after only 3 video exports. It isnt worth it. Youre better off using iMovie"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Grate app Thank Adobe"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"App work same like in desktop"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I have used Rush and definitely one of the jewels in the crown of Adobe. Unfortunately though my trail has run out. I have recommended it to friend a helping with the basic skills lightroom and photoshopping. I just recently during lockdown into this world. Thank you I would love to use as soon as I am able after lockdown some of my friends could subscribe. I don't want to use illegal so I wait patiently."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work and freezes up my phone"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"unusable.. used to be easy to add audio and make simple clips but turn into god knows how to do anything pia"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Mind blowing interface, could give us a lil more free usage too."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Bakwas"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Whenever I export a video there are glitches in the exported video I have to export it multiple times to get a good exported video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Terrible, every time i open it i get ""fetching projects..."" and nothing happens once i left it for an hour and still nothing happened. I domt understand why it needs to search for something that doesnt exist yet to open."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Never lets you export. Not worth it."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's a very user-friendly video editor when it comes to functionalitu, but major bummer is, the quality of the video is different when I render it, and most of the times the music/audio I put breaks... hope you can fix this..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really great amateur video editing app. Good for what it's worth, some things could do with improving such as adding titles and duplicating clips - it's really finicky, but other than that works well for simple video editing and loads of ways to play around."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Bad at Title and subtitle edition :("
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Pls take out the upgrade for unlimited export just make it normal now i cant save any vids"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Todo lo que hace Adobe esta Rotisimo!‚ù§"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Love the app but it often freezes and I have to delete and re install"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worrest rendering time.most off time app crash during render"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Helps w converting .mov files to Android mp4s."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Always glitches in export. Audio skips or out of sync, video flashing to black. Now doesn't even load and app is stuck on fetching projects."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to edit."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This is getting very very frustrating!!! I exported my video 5 times now and my video is nowhere to be found in my gallery... if this cannot be fix please just refund my money back that I paid for this subscription. I'd rather take my business somewhere else!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Its a very good app, but if u want to Montage a game Video u will get lower Graffick"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy and essential."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I like it but wish it had a better free starter plan"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"working on a project and it crashes every 5-10s and reopens. cannot export either (starts, 5-10s in it crashes). it's become unreliable."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"slow but works"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Not working properly!!! MF"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is not worth your precious time. It loads way to long and doesnt even work? Just a waste of money."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Niceeeeeee"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have a Pixel 3. I can load the media but every time I attempt to edit it, the program crashes. Not impressed."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Ah, Adobe products. Far ahead in some aspects, while also lagging way behind in others. App is interesting. I like the idea of editing video on a mobile device. It functions well, and is optimized for a phone or tablet. You cannot export. Quite surprising that they wait until the export screen to tell you that you've only three exports before having to pay. On that same screen is where the frustration in the app lies. The export doesn't work. Hard to justify paying $13 a month for that."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"No doubt Adobe is best. But i am not able to use it on my OnePlus 6 device (8 gb ram). My device went off 3 times while using it. Did normal settings and cleaning or whatever you say. This thing never happened before with my device doesn't matter whatever apps i use. Yes, one more thing i was just going through the video which i had to edit then this device went off, now think what will happen if i edit or export the video. LoL"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"PRE TRIAL LOL"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"The rendering is horrible on this app, everything worked fine while editing but after the render, the video is full of lags and glitches, Please don't download this software"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Ass"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Incredible....just what I've been looking for BUT is this Adobe Premiere Clip video editor now? I pay a lot each month for my work adobe sub which I was supposed to get Premiere Clip free on mobile app but it doesn't seem to exist....unless this is the do-over? Please advise Adobe!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"This app is great! I used it for a school project and the video came out great."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"If I could put 0 stars I would..it kept freezing and going off for no absolute reason"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Faster"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"This program is too expensive for how laggy it is."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"I'm so impressed with this app! It's very straightforward and powerful, making it handy when my laptop isn't available. My only wish for future versions is for it to include basic keyframing options to animate custom transitions, camera movements, etc."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best app for Android"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This is good editing app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üòçüòçüòç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD! I'm running a two month old Samsung S10 and this app was glitchy, unstable and crashes too often. I had just finished a two hour edit, and the app not only crashed, but deleted the project too. I was gutted. Please, save yourself from the same inconvenience and avoid at all costs."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Love this app it's amazing just like ms word Microsoft apps adobe and google all have great work and productivity applications for everyday use or if you would like to run your own business , in school, or everyday usage."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"I have upgraded premiere rush and now am not able to export any video can u help to fix this issue at the earliest"

"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Disgusting experience. I was trying to edit my video, but it plays sound for hardly one second, after that video continues to play but sound stops. You have to pause and play again to hear the sound for another second and repeat the same."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Best video editor for smartphones, so smooth! Lot of features, insane."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Terbaik"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"I think this app has alot if potential and I have no problems with it. Everything runs fine, it's just that....10 dollars a month...to export videos? That's just plain stupid. I understand as a app it needs money, but...you can still have reasons to buy the full version. You should be able to save as many videos as you want, but here you can only do T H R E E. 3! Apps like inshot have unlimited exports without money, so if your young like me with no monthly income, I would recommend inshot :)"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps crashing during editing. Can't get anything done."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Keeps freezing or the options don't work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"It's a good app, actually a great app for editing. The only problem I have is with the exporting, my last edit was a video which totalled at 22 mins which is close to 10GB and everytime I export it, the exported video is only 9 mins and 3 GB instead of the whole thing. Please fix this. And the other problem I have is with uploading it to cloud, it doesn't like simply it doesn't."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"good. üëçüëçüëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"üëç"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Editing is excellent..... But rendering is so irritating and slow..... Frustating..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Most usefull app for editing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Plz add more colorgrading option..... üôèüôè"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't render properly on the free version, so I purchased the subscription version, and still glitchy. App or google play has no way to get a refund even if you try to cancel an hour later without using any features. Do not pay for subscription!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Simple and easy vedio ediitor, does not have much transition option in free version Gets stuck in btw, so I had to do some steps all over again.. But it's worth the trouble"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"The best video editor I have experienced on Android, and without watermark too! Altough you only get 3 free exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It's one of the best video editors"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"There are only 3 transitions. The 3 transitions there are terrible You only get 3 free exports. You cant make your own effects There is no chroma key. You cant make your own transitions. Bear in mind these are the same people who made ae."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"NEEDS A REVERSE CLIP"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"You have to pay if you want more than 3 exports"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"app keeps crashing on s10+"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and resourceful for video content creators..!!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"I exported the 2 GB video twice but the music got all mixed up and lagged. It's so annoying. Adobe how is this possible. Please help. So what happenned was I finished editing and exported the video, it took a long time to process and get exported. But after it got exported, the final product's music started 2 seconds after the video started. And then the video also hung up and glitched in the middle. Hence wasn't able to use the video at all."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Works well. Doesn't replace premiere pro but helps with quick social media stuff."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Its very nice apps"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Good for non premium, how about instead of limiting users to 3 exports in total, you make it only an export for every 3 days."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing! Best video app I've ever used! Great for business!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Great video editing app."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Did exactly what I needed it to do! Video speed. Love anything Adobe! Wish your subscription was more ala cart though."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"It was decent to make something, despite lacking in features, but then the audio just bugged out so much after rendering. Going to have to find a different app because lyrics keep repeating themselves"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Never had this issue but it took 10 minutes to load the thing, then it would say error can't import clips... seems like the easiest damn thing to fix"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Freezes often"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"I love the app so far but when I try to move a video it just goes back ot it's original spot idk if it's me not knowing what to do (which it probably is) or it's just designed that way. Okay that was kind of confusing but basically I cant add blank space between my two videos it just puts it back right by my other video"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Amazing app..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"i need more options"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"This app is so slow"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Really good Video Editor, the Audio track selector needs folder support."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"very laggy even on my oneplus 7t"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"It crashes here and there. That's the only problem so far"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Exported files are typically corrupted, stutter, and glitch. It's not worth an app purchase, much less a subscription. Why would I pay for this glitchy app again? Features are great, but if you can't export your clips there is no point."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"System bug and Monthly payment is too expensive can you make yearly payment üëé"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Too slow and does not support Arabic writing"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"Its pretty good, but if I am gonna pay $10 a month for this I expect there to be no glitch in the music audio when the video is exported."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Excelente herramienta para edici√≥n de v√≠deos."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Proportional label video editing .. very impressive"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"can't I save an edited video? why do I have to export directly to social media? after paying for the full version?"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I appreciated the tutorial design as well. Easy, linear, useful."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Pretty pointless unless you're willing to pay ¬£9 a month to save what you make (you can save a measly 3 things for free) Also..... It's pretty limited in what you can actually do..."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just spent an hour making a video and no matter what I do it won't render successfully. I would have been interested in upgrading the app if I was actually able to use the video I created."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Gifs dont work,never using this app again"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"awsome"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",3,"This app is an experience, it is owned by Adobe so you can expect a professional app, that also wants money. If you do not want to spend money it comes with a demo mode, where you can export 3 videos. I wasted one of mine becouse the app would not let me export the video. It can be a good app when you get the hang of it, on the apps export page it only lets me export it too Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok, and an Adobe app. I can not upload it to My gallery or YouTube, which the tutorial said I coul"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very simple but effective. A threat for professionals as the average joe will be able to produce quality content straight from their financed smartphone."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Nic"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and quite fun!! Even as a graphic designer!"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Like"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"Satisfied"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"Just endlessly loads projects on opening and won't allow me to do anything."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",4,"Actually I never used it üòÖ"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"Don't bother unless you will cinsider paying $10/mo to be able to export your videos. I've been(& am currently) an Adobe Plan subscriber & had been Suites purchaser, before the birth of monthly plans, for many years so I have nothing against Adobe. But I think there are a lot better video editing options for the serious video maker and much more economical (& better) options for the casual user. ADOBE, Maybe consider giving a good number of FREE exports per month for at least the casual user."
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",2,"renders always laggy, used all 3 free renders just for a disappointing export, 2 star because the interface is easy to work with and has features other mobile editor apps dont have"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",5,"As soon as I can learn more I can enjoy it"
"Adobe Premiere Rush","Unknown",1,"it said 'there was an error during login,could you please rate this app 0 stars' and I said yes,I did it.....cannot login......a waste of space"
