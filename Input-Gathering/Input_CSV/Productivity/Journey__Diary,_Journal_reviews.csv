"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool to store info"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey since 2015 and as someone who never fixates on just one app for a certain purpose, I must say, Journey had me captivated. I think what stood out to me from the very beginning was the easy to use interface but also the very clean and minimalistic design. Also, I also really like the new features that have been added over the years (like stories) without compromising the basic integrity of the app design and making it better. I hope Journey stays as amazing as it is <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Nice app👌🏿"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app, have been using it religiously for years for my journaling needs. My only issue with it is that if I copy text from elsewhere that contains line breaks or separate paragraphs, the app will not let me paste it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Seems to only use AI to answer questions! Not helpful!! I can't find 2 years worth of journal entries and there is no way for AI to help me sort this. I've tried. I've tried to talk to a human for a week. I can't even find an email to ants to ask these questions. I need access to my old journal and it seems maybe because my subscription ended they deleted everything! Even though I just reinstated my user status. I sure hope they didn't delete everything! They force you to keep your membership!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Handy app, but beware, you get no notice before an automatic renewal and the policy is not to refund you if you forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and clear. So far no annoying ads. I can happily continue to use it as it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app for journaling, like the custom template feature but it's not intuitive to edit or clean up if you want to change your template. Using Google drive to sync and it's really inconsistent about actually syncing as I switch between 3 devices, PC, Android phone, Android tablet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app I know give wrong address but know that know do want not to do I love app lot on. Do say. I am change act. Grow up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love Love Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Pleased with Journey / Diary. It's so easy to get used to, & It's Everything I Could Want From A Diary! MANY THANKS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years, love it, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app is good. But I got charged almost 50 USD for journey cloud services which I never used and I was not even aware of it. Not even getting a response from the customer service. And it's the worst. They never reply. Terribly disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi I have been using this app for some time now, but for the past few months, I don't seem to be able to log in with Google on the web version. It is incredibly frustrating since I can't use it on my computer anymore. I've tried different browsers as well but it just won't load the Google account window."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App does not support photos in heic file format, which is very disappointing in 2025."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years, and every single entry is gone. I haven't opened it since Jan 20. 2025. Devastating, what happened, devs?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have used Journey for years. The app just started closing when I opened it and wouldn't sync when I tried to back up as usual. My understanding was I had my journal on their cloud, so I logged out and tried to log back in. I didn't have my credentials, so I reset the password. All my journals are gone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Incredible reliability, efficient, smooth and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"might as well just make it a one time payment to own the app and i'd be happier - can't even add a geotag or more than 4 photos per entry without paying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and great since first time doing this writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Takes eternity to download images"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"too many ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Impressed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app for journalling. I've been using it for a long time - at least five years I think. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself is perfect BUT.. The reason for my uninstallation was I couldn't make an account. It said *Error* every single time I tried. If u fixed it, I thank u for replying to this review. ♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and chronicle life as a caregiver to a mom with cancer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Usuful app... I love it..... Is there a quick method I can use to transfer all entries in my former digital diary into JOURNEY?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ii like diary. I. Be good not delete this time is. Great favorite. Google diary. I like it I give five star"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have this app for almost three years now and it never failed me nor I had any issues with it. I totally recommend it. Worth the money. Looking forward to updates. Five more years on this app and never looked back nor looked out for replacements. Simple to use, and no complicated interface. It does the job of journaling very well plus the ability to attach media to every entry makes is so much better. It was well worth it. Soon, will be buying the membership so I would sync to all my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a great app, simple to use, to detail daily events, jot notes, and much more! No complications - just a great app that is always there to capture our daily thoughts and actions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am using the free version. It is a very good tool which allows more than I expected."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Backup feature is amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app to record my daily activities, including photos of the activities. It synch my entities with all my other devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to write journals but I get 2 entries in and never open it but here I talk about everything and I use this a lot more I love it ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app since college. A lots has changed. I have missed to write over the years. But now I will start writing here again. It's a nice to feeling to write here on my journal ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Syncing has stopped."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome since the app doesn't force you to pay for it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Buena la aplicación"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I use since 4 year all smooth but suddenly it's not open and crash very disappointed ☹️☹️☹️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I couldn't get this to work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is great for journaling it is everything I wanted to replace the other I had on an old tablet. There are more features than I use, but for my needs it is sufficient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for years it's been a great Journaling application. I love that I can store pictures to look back upon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome 🥺"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Edit Feb 2025: still haven't heard back from the developers about the money they unnethically got from me (a bug in the free trial which immediately charged me). Recommend people to avoid at all costs! Could be a good app, but absolutely no working support channel and scam business model with tricked memberships. No email. Only a bot chat, where I got no replies for 5 days. And I'm a member, and haven't received a reply back in months. Just avoid thia anti-ethic app, plenty of diary apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far I really like using the app. My only gripe is how I can't link to calendar events to help contextualise some of my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good app... Although I can't use it anymore since I installed an update. The App doesn't even open anymore. All my notes and writings are gone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app offers a perfect balance of simplicity and functionality, making it my top choice for daily journaling. It provides essential features for documenting my thoughts, reflections and experiences without unnecessary complexity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for a long time from 2017 . The updates are truly amazing and useful and i hope this experience with this app only Improves and I'm looking forward to use this app many more years too come. Great job team. God bless you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cloud services aren't working properly so new data isn't getting uploaded to the cloud. Also, too many ads it's incredibly distracting when I'm trying to type something"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's smooth to operate, it stores your data and you can use the web, wow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this diary and it best one. I give my answer but like want keep who behind nice to me I give five star like app it listen to me this app great I like app it five star like this app it very cool . App like journey reallygrreat I going to keep it love this. Journey like this diary. Like journey five star"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app as it is easy to use and has various ways to journal plus I like adding my pictures of my journey ☺️. I like to voice my thoughts and this feature does a perfect job with that. Cheryl J."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not purchase premium membership! Calendar doesn't work right and can't sync pc. Not user friendly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Option for addition of personalized templates or choosing from some default templates will make my rating as 5 STAR 😊 Edit: this was added"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"ভালো এপ। অনেক খরুচে"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cathartic, self-expression, declaration, I'm ok."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! it's been 7 years of using it, and it's been so insightful to scroll back and see how and who I was back then. It's so well designed, with just enough features, not overwhelming at all. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app as my personal diary. I love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app killed it. I can't give it anything less than 5 star. Good job, developer!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have used it for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for diary writing. The interface is awesome to get your thoughts and ideas into words without distraction/clutter. No ads to intervene your flow of thoughts. Absolutely love it. It has helped me a lot especially during stressful times when I'm overthinking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They ask you to sign up for premium before you even access the app, dangling a carrot in front of you. The app also relies on overly complicated templates rather than being inherently intuitive, calming, or easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app but 2 things bother me: The buttons to quickly pass pages doesn't work in the calendar view Also when I copy paste for some reason it adds white space between every line"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for journal writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i bought this app cos it links with cloud so can use on a desktop and generally like it although spacing of entries means not much is seen on a phone. also adding old entries eg significant past events is frustrated by the poor date interface, scrolling being the only option. Actually if you tap the year at the top you can change it quickly so it's ok now. Since trying other diary/journaling apps I've appreciated the writing interface and location feature more here. I've come back to it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"make a better tomorrow. 😌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful experience. Had used the app in the past but not anymore. I cancelled on the day of the renewal but the money was already taken out of my account. Asked for a refund as the 14 day cooling off period applies. Had an initial response from support but then went silent. Take a look at the reviews for ""journey.cloud"" on Trustpilot - plenty of others with the same experience of getting scammed out of their money - stay away!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for more than 5 years now. I've tried other apps - but Journey wins the top spot hands down. The templates, the maps-feature, automatic weather logging - just cool stuff. AND: The support is outstanding, the time to fix issues is commendably short!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"More than good enough, but I wish it had it programmed that you can give notes names."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like diary. Angela we'll back might get a phone. Dec. So wait dec. Ilike. Di really journey because keep download is best I give five stars like I journey it h great one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years now. This is a better journal app than any other that I've tried."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"3 day free trial then requires payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app more that Instagram now, I like the thought of having to express myself privately. I like that if you forgot to journal yesterday you can just go back at the Calendar and write your thoughts. It's really helpful with my mental health too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Functional thing on first installation. Worked well and has nice interface. But Not recommended. Not so good at re sync after changing handsets and Keeps on trying to sell premium membership even after purchasing previously."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to love using this app. The discounts that's been offered to people on special holidays is only redeemable once and yet you will always get promotional offers for it and can't claim it. In order to even export your journals away from this money grabbing app, you need to be a paying subscriber. Clicked on a ""3-day"" trial and got charged immediately for the year. That's really bad way to grab people's money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"When saving journal entries to a docx file, the date is not included. It is not useful without the date. I submitted this problem some time ago, but no resolution."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app . Had been using it for 4 yrs now ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app. Imma using this since 2023, and I am so happy with this app, this been my accountability partner. Thank you so much for this wonderful app. You can use it without purchasing subscription dw. And with subscription it's most wonderful app ever created abt journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Feature request: Please add a method to include jump link to previous entries. Great App! Intuitive and very easy to use. I really commend the developers for being responsive and for actively perfecting the app! Thanks for the mood badges by the way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love that I can tell my life story with my own personal pictures and images prompts are nice too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Very useful I can journal without info getting lost in the comfy of my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for premium only to have it taken away five minutes later. This company stole 7 bucks from me and id like it back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible customer service. Data doesn't transfer when you get a new phone, and their overseas service department refuses to assist. Lost years of entries because they won't help me - and that's WITH a paid account. Get literally any other app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'd love to use this app more, but I paid for the premium for my device, yet many, many features still prompt me for a subscription and I can't use them because of it. What exactly is the point of premium, then? Feels like I paid for nothing tbh. I'm debating getting a refund because this is very misleading. Even the premium vs. subscription FAQ specified that subscription is multi-device and premium is one-device. If I'm only using one device, why is everything paywalled???"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a wonderful app. Thank you Two App Studio."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app .serves it's purpose well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly fine. Thank you to the brains behind this marvellous work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am a premium member. But Journey doesn't allow to syncronize my entry other device. It so bad. I want to give negetive star mark to Journey for this. Very disappointed. I hate Journey app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been searching for an app that allowed me to sync to other devices for free and finally found this. I'm so glad I found this app, the content is simple yet clean. It's easy to navigate of course, and has many options for making my entries more in depth. I love the look of the app so much. A feature I might add is the ability to change the look of the icon, but totally not necessary. Thank you for providing a high quality journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Long time I ago I paid for premium options, such as being able to export my notes in multiple formats. Meanwhile, this option is now moved for me behind the paywall, even tho I payed for it before, they just erased my premium. After so many years, I guess it's time to move on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Edit: the app is far less annoying now and very useful This used to be the best journal app, but the addition of several ads asking you to purchase premium any time you do anything, as well as notifications about sales, makes it very frustrating to use. Annoying people into making a purchase is not acceptable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Suddenly my journey can not be opened and now all my notes are gone.... Please help me how to retrieve my previous notes on my daily journal ???"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a best tool to journey your dairy and flow your brain and to make your memories especially if you improve yourself every day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am a lifetime member and bought a new phone and can't upload heif images. It's a journal and should accept all.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great ui and ux. Easy to use. But the only thing you will dislike is the free plan has very limited options like not all the basics atleast. I does not allow us to show us the the previous months. And it really irritates when the discount offer for the premium plan always pops up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal with alot of self made templates. Works great for me. Just love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"this app is getting worse now just scrolling 1 short note and it lags alot, scrolling seem struggle it just bad on performance"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I don't know what you've changed, but now there is a problem with dates. Every time when I want to change day and time of my daily note the date always jumps to the next day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've been using Journey since 2018. There's always been paid teirs for extra features which I didn't mind. However in the last year or so they have introduced the in house syncing and storage instead of storing via Google drive, they have also attached the extra features to that. You now have to pay a monthly fee even to sync your own entries. Thankfully I was able to export my entries and transfer back to Google drive. But I'm not pleased with this model."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish I could have separate journals - one personal, the other(s) for projects or work or travel. I don't mean tags on entries, but actual separate journals, each with its own widget. Right now I am using multiple apps to do this, but they aren't as classy as Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No problems with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for a long time now. But recently I purchased a new phone and I am not able to transfer my entries. It is really disappointing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"chatGPT suggested this app after asking for a few basic requirements to be met and this had been a great journey. I keep coming back, so this journey will keep going🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the ease of recording my lifes experiences, it's therapeutic and fun. I highly recommend Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean UI. Simple to use. Love the Mood and Geo tag with weather. Great little features. (2018) Here we are years later and I'm back to it. I've tried a few others, but this in my opinion is still the most simple, clean, user friendly UI in the app store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app , I've been using it to document things in my life for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't even properly express myself of how grateful I am to find this app. Thank you so much 🥹"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very swag app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for keeping notes your whole life on Earth."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect mobile journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app 😍 thank you so much Journey team 🙏🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like that it syncs my phone and laptop and that I can add photos to entries. I also like the lock code for keeping snoopers out! Idk who would be snooping, but still, it's comforting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using this over 5 years, everything is good except in my early usage i had already purchased lifetime premium. Until suddenly my account sttus isnt premium anymore and i gotta pay new price lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have enjoyed this app for several years now, but there's a bug that has appeared that prevents being able to paste text into a journal entry. I've reported it, but it's not being fixed and it's interfering with my ability to use it. When I communicated this problem to support they acknowledged that it existed but didn't seem interested in doing anything about it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app. I used this in 2021 but the price is expensive and for journey cloud sync drive they only provide 10GB storage and if want 200GB need to pay for journey signature. To me there are better app and cheaper too for unlimited entries even with AI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! I can switch between my android phone and iPad and my PC desktop, which is amazing, and I love the design and usability, best journal app I've ever seen 😊 I wouldn't change a thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and elegant, the fact I can write my thoughts anywhere, on desktop and mobile is amazing. Love the interface and the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"User experience is very clunky, even with the annual subscription of $50. For that amount, I'd expect an amazing experience. Used this app for the first day I got it for maybe 4 hours before I was at my wits end and knew I needed to find a different solution. Thankfully, I found a free app with more features and better layout. When I reached out to customer service chat for a refund, they were responsive but not helpful and fairly short with me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Con la version gratuita no puede ni hacerme mi propia plantilla gratis"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used Journey for years, mainly on Android (premium) and sometimes via Apple or through a pc. Like most apps, a subscription only applies to one medium, but given that the free version is available across platforms means it is always there. A good, reliable journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, has all necessary features for a journaling app. A bit hard to navigate at first, but with all the cool features, it should not only make sense why it is hard to navigate at first, but propel you for an enjoyful experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I NEED a FREE journal app! Journey is NOT the app for me! How do I uninstall all my PERSONAL information?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A scam. Black on black text unless you pay them. Good luck seeing what you type Edit in response: lol no and no. I simply deleted your app for another. Make me pay for ""colored"" text 🤣🤣 The balls to even have that listed as premium is laughable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Had app for 9 years..now you have to pay in order to find your previous entries, unless you want to scroll backwards but only to see 5 entries at a time in reversed chronological order. Try looking up an entry a year or two ago. They have taken away the calendar 🗓️ access which allows you to actually lookup and search for your previous entries....and I'm pretty sure I purchased a ""lifetime"" sub years ago. #nickleanddimeyoutodeath"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this journal for work and personal use. Would be hard to live without it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good free app helped me to write my journal without having to do the physical one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for a couple of years, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Journaling helps my mental health, and this app makes it easy to do anytime, from anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app. A downside is the journal does not have an auto save and I've lost a few entries because I forgot to hit the checkmark to save my work. A big plus is that I don't need WiFi to use the app. Nov 21,2024. Two years since my first review. Journey continues to improve. It meets my needs. I especially like the ability to post images to my journals. It's a travel-log, and I can view all the images at once, instead of having to view each separate journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I will not recommend this app because if you change phones or your phone gets damaged you can't access your journal after paying for lifetime premium. I'm very disappointed 😞. After using the app since 2019 I lost all my journal entries because my phone got damaged. They were synced to cloud but still I can't restore. I regret buying this junk."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Few things are more important to one's journey than a journal. This is what you will find in journey - that trusted companion that will reflect your growth and mirror back to you your incredible progress. Keep going, you're not alone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app publisher is the greediest I've encountered ever. They don't care about you after they've got your money. I paid for lifetime license and the apps don't work as advertised. There's no feature parity across platforms, and they are artificially slowing down sync via Google Drive so that you are forced to use Journey Cloud sync. When you contact support, they respond very slow and then they ghost you. Do not give them any money. There are better products in market."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Very local-unfriendy experience, despite offer of self-hosting. Relentless ads for cloud syncing, premium, coaching, etc. Stories as a bad implementation of viewing stats and previous entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Trying to get back on my journal report for my acts an what is my best ideal leave a person like he went long"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was not a bad app, but lost my entities after i re installed the app 😥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is good. But his arrangement gives me a hard time. I think I have no experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In comparison to other journaling apps ... this is my personal favourite as it has a simple yet efficient plan and structure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been great so far, I love how simple it is to use. The Web app too is easy to access and use. Thank you guys!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"You used to be able to delete notes from inside note view. Now you can't, I guess? You have to go out to list view, then click and hold, then select delete. Kind of clunky."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a waste of money to upgrade my account? It can no longer synchronize on different devices! Sync errorB0301"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cloud service is not working. It says ""not connected to the Internet * although I have a strong connection. Lenovo P11 gen 2. Update - it's fixed now. Thank you for the prompt response"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is such a good app and I can also add entry to the older days but I'm sorry I have to uninstall this because the web version is more interesting for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for personal diary with snapshot notes. Update 2/16/18: Still using it a year later Support is responsive. Excellent app. Update 11/5/24: Stopped using it a couple of years ago to try other apps, but now back with lifetime subscription. Best app for timeline journaling with pics and tags, weather and location, and both mobile and web access!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Achei muito bom, bem completo tendo em vista o que eu preciso"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent way to record your thoughts and clear your head."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"New experience loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great easy to use app has everytjing i need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Google drive sync not working sometimes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. It's free and has no ads and it is awesome. I write in it Alot. And I love keeping a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I bought the premium app and have been using it for a couple of years now. Edit: using it for close to 10 years now! It's a very good app that does what I want it to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for years, I Love it! Fun to look back now &then. Wonderful app! Thanks! The journal that didn't get lost! Even though a tornado 😁 Update I dropped my phone transferring all my stuff to my to my new phone all the apps had become unloaded. Did I loose ALL The Years On This Appt?!🤬😡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I rated is a exciting meet for pancer pleased go back download option notable no fac .... tual at lot logic .... Great ....█♪☕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great writing memories here"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice UI, Clean and minimalist."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've just started using this app however it does everything I wanted to do and more. I especially like how versatile it is I use Linux and I'm still able to have a desktop version thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why you share the data with 3rd party when you know this is about personal thing. You also want to access google drive otherwise not allowing to sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great interface, easy to add photos, easy to use. It's perfect for me. Developers stay on top of issues. Decided to go with the premium version to show support for a great app. Update: Still using app & still loving it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The option to journal on the web and the phone is really nice. I find the tags helpful when trying to find memories as well. Great app I use daily!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and quick to use. Helps to track day to day activities. Best app for keeping memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Easy to use and like the prompt questions. I usually forget it exists though and only write sporadic entries. Like that I can add pictures to my diary entries too. However, I thought that I bought a lifetime version of it and not have to pay each year. Of I'd known that in the beginning, I'd probably chose not to enter this app at all. It's simply too expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app and should probably just dish out the cash for premium. However, using the free version, they advertise the premium soooo much it is extremely annoying. You can't hardly do anything without having to close a premium ad. Edit: I did dish out the cash for premium and I'm glad I did. It has been a great experience, online and everything. One improvement would be that some of the exports have weird formatting, and one of them, I couldn't see the dates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have spent years documenting my learning with videos and detailed instructions but have lost 2 years worth of entries. I can't seem to find out how to contact directly. The help centre is unhelpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app has suddenly started crashing way too often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very nice App ❤️ for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app I recommend it to everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has been a consistent in quality app that I have made great use of. Thank you devs, you are greatly appreciated for your hard work and dedication!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Completely pointless app that uses shady billing practices. I would never pay this developer, they are highly unethical. You can get the same functionality for free with other apps, such as Notion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I literally chose to write this review. I didn't need a prompt to make me write this. I have been using the Journey app for years now and I didn't feel the need to write a review but now I do! I want everyone to know about this app and to see how amazing it is. It is a great journal app, it is a simple journaling platform which allows me to store all my memories, thoughts, pictures and more. I've thoroughly enjoyed this app, and I will be using it for years to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It has been a helpful companion"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its a great app . I really wish if you can add a ""title"" option close to the date , it will be healpful and much easier to go back in diaries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app!!! Helped me get into keeping a diary, beautiful format and keeping a passcode is easy! Works super well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"New update seems to have fixed the issues and even my cloud stuff is restored. Not keen on the new UI but that's just me, it's a lot slicker than the old version to be fair."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Whenever you make an entry, a pop-up screams in your face to give the app a rating on the app store. It starts this behavior immediately, before you even have a feel for the app, is extremely intrusive, and as I said, it happens *every single time.* So here's your rating; hope you're happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great journaling app. Absolutely worth the price, convenient, and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app since I became a mum and have so many wonderful funny, beautiful memories of things my kids have said and done. They're 15 and 13 now and they loove hearing me read about the things they did or said when they were little! Best app thank you! And there was a time recently I thought I had lost all the entries and the support was so quick to respond and made me realise Journey have my memories secured. 😊🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I honestly love this app, I'm not the journaling type but this app has positively impacted my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Crazy High Price! ..... not pay $50.00 a year!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"جميل جدا"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Has become unusable once again. Crashes every single time. You guys should test the app properly before rolling out updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update...Uninstalled and reinstalled. Seems issue was in downloading from a different Google account and app didn't recognize it was already purchased. I'm certain I bought this app already some time ago, yet it made me purchase a membership in order to ""use full features"". But the app is excellent! I gave 4 stars because of having the purchase problem and because of not being able to dismiss the forced review pop-up. But I enjoy the functionality of the app and being able to sync to Google."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"There should have been a price reduction offered for the life-time membership of the desktop version. For owners of a life-time membership on mobile. A 50 dollar reduction would be ideal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for Journaling. Been using for 5+ years. Sync is sometimes difficult. But overall, it's a very nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I accidentally subscribed for a year because I was misled about a free trial but apparently since I had used it before a couple years ago it was no longer valid but they didn't tell me this so they charged me for a full year. I reached out to cancel my subscription and they stopped responding to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app badly needs landscape support, a bit silly for a writing focused app to not support this use case."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't open the app anymore? It just instantly closes as soon as I click on it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of the best app for daily journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why is there no way to cancel this subscription before rebilling?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Crashes often, log can't be access due to bugs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This journaling application used to be my preferred choice. Due to my frequent travels, I find it beneficial to be able to review my past experiences. However, upon acquiring a new Samsung S24 Plus and downloading the application, I discovered that accessing content from my previous device now requires a paid subscription. If a subscription model is to be implemented, I kindly request the inclusion of a lifetime subscription option to eliminate the inconvenience of recurring monthly payments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app it has helped me soo much over the years i hope nothing changes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app and the many features. I can upload pics and pen my thoughts. I like being able to write my scripture lessons daily. I have used this app on and off yet always find my way back to it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been using this app for year. But in recent years, I've used it less because I'm unable to upload HEIC photos which is the format that all phone use now. Now I would have to convert my photos to JPEG and I've asked support countless times over the years to provide this support to no avail. Very disappointing and sadly the syncing has been inconsistent in recent years as well. May need to look for an alternative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I liked and used an earlier version of this app. I took a break from it awhile back and now all of my entries are gone. I did not receive any notice of the change. I feel betrayed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been so easy for me to keep track of all my traveling memories and photos in one place!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hey Dev, journey app is great but still not which you can recommend or use it in long-term. The constant pop-ups for premium is a deal-breaker. If I had or wanted to go premium, I'll definitely go for it, your forcing wont help. Also, your web version is mess. No proper way of compartmentalization of sections. All mixed up. No section like notes, entries, all on front. No list view, grid view, hide text only title view. See simple notes web and app. Dark theme is missing for late nights writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It makes me feel like I can finally Express my fellings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app Beautiful Sync easily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just brilliant. Used it for years and it's fantastic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ਧੰਨਵਾਦ"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'm digging this app quite a bit, but there's just no way that I'm going to pay $40 after a 3-day trial... I mean good God, at least give a 30 day trial! Can the membership cost not be broken down into a monthly, weekly options? I'm really bummed out about this. I wanted to continue using it but just not willing to pay it back much money especially that quickly 😭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very effective 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There are no issues, and that is a perfect merit on its own."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is absolutely awesome. While so simple it works like a charm and the added features are really cool. I love this app to keep a journal of my prayers to Jesus and the teachings ai get from Jesus while in meditation after prayer. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So , You've come to the right place. According to me this is the right diary app it has everything and more .1. Noone will know when they see the app in your phone that its your diary unlike those apps with a huge lock on them titled diary 2.Everything inside is is order , style of writting . It has emotions, templates for stuff , AI bot , Search bar , everything ,backup 3. No annoying ads 4theres a ĺot of stuff in the free version Bottomline its the best diary app out there, Download you'll c"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app for several years. Great improvement and its one of the favourite apps of mine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has been a good app so far , have free version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Literally been using it as a diary, and so far, so good!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Extremely poor subscription management. Despite canceling in March 2024, I was incorrectly charged in July with no refund or accountability. My member status was changed to 'Subscription member' without consent. Customer support failed to resolve the issue. I canceled my subscription in March 2024. Your system confirms that I unsubscribed, yet you still charged me in July and you changed my status from unsubscribe to subscribe without my consent. This is clearly a system error on your part."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app! I have been using it for YEARS! Easy to use, fingerprint enabled and so much more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. It's so easy to use and even the free version allows you so many features. Definitely recommend this to beginners as well as pros."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I’m unable to sync my entries with Google Drive. I’ve tried clearing my cache, restarting my phone, logging in and out, and verifying the folder in Google Drive, but nothing seems to work. I’m considering uninstalling the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Wish i couls put more emotions of the day as well instead of rating it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App not opening"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I can keep track of everything on it. If I need to know when something occurred, I can use the search. It is VERY helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Intuitive. Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have a bunch of diaries, but I downloaded this one to keep a log of my health and progress. Since I downloaded it, it's been the only one I've been using. It's easy to keep up with, had a bunch of templates you can use. The interface is pretty cool. I'd recommend it. 💯👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost all my entries automatically. I wasn't expecting this from such a seemingly high end journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it's needed for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using it for when i have my kids, documenting where we are and what we did. Could also be useful in family court."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Heeeelp! 😱 All of the sudden, when I open the app it closes itself. And doesn't let me in. And I have many important notes in it 🥲"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much ♥️ my personal notebook"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite journall app to use. It feels like a social media app for my personal story. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice diary app. Recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lovely app. I would give 5 stars if there was a more reasonable lifetime purchase option. It's great they have one but $140 CAD with taxes is way too high for an app. There are many apps that are priced far lower so I don't buy the excuse, IMO it's greed. Also the ads to upgrade are harassment level and ruin the experience. Not the way to win and keep happy customers. I'm someone who regularly buys lifetime access to apps to support developers but this won't be one of them for the above reasons."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, love the tagging option and ability to use it on the computer as well!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, yet effective!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only journal app I've ever used. I have so many entries that are so special to me. Only trust journey with all my words. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They lost all my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Its kinda stupid that stuff that should be free is not"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can be used across platform without either iOS or android holding your data"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for the desktop app (twice, for two computers) and now they're planning to end support for that software. Yes, really. UPDATE: I paid $17.99 for ""lifetime access"" to the desktop version even though I'd bought it before. The alternative was to spend hours copying and pasting my entries from the web version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love your app, but i will give you only 3 stars because pls let us use heif format photos to upload. (.heic) I can't upload my photos from our android phone to your app, but your ios supported heif."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"5 stars, ABSOLUTELY. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app AND the website refuse to acknowledge that I purchased a one year subscription. The website says I have an annual plan in settings, but everywhere else, it says I'm on the free plan. Other reviewers here are reporting the same problem as me. No response from the devs for ANY of us. We're all stuck with subscriptions we can't use. 😪 P.S. I just got a popup ad on the website for a paid plan when I'm already on a paid plan according to my account settings AND Google Play."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Charged me £50 without authorisation!!! (Pretending their tariffs changed last minute) Don't bother. It will bombard you with pop-up screens offering deals and stuff. And it still is clumsy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Appalling customer service! Do not sign up for the year's subscription without marking multiple calendars because they will not send you a courtesy email to remind you of the renewal date and will just charge you for another year then their customer service team will rudely and abruptly refuse you a refund. This is appalling and underhanded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful app, I'm on android 14 and i get a black screen 70% of the time. Please fix, I'm finding another app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app. It works just right for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app experience and a good set of features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you have to pay for everything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app I really use daily, interestingly suggested by ad. For the first time, Ad/Sponsored google suggested app found to be better than the one which I was searching."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this mostly for daily journalling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I initially invested quite a bit of money upfront for Journey, expecting to receive a comprehensive journaling experience with a range of benefits. However, my experience has been disappointing. Each time Journey introduces a new feature, they expect users to pay an additional monthly fee. This constant demand for more money feels like being nickel and dimed to death.Once you're integrated into their ecosystem and have all your entries saved, it feels almost impossible to leave. The app creates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Unusable with constant crashes. Literally crashes every time I open my journal, telling me there's a bug. Web version has been good to use but this is useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: app seems to be functional now. Always appreciate the dev teams for being responsive. This continues to be one of my favorite and most beautiful apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I need. Between this app and Google calendar I can pretty much keep track of my life past, present and future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Generally good but some annoying pop ups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app, and just fell in love with the way you journal with this, then probably a year later had an issue, mailed them and they helped me so quick. These guys are brilliant! Very good customer feedback and swift to sort out any issues if there is any..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Having fun with it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very worst app ever I saw in playstore i have been using this app for 1 year and now I am trying to retrieve my old notes and now your are asking money to upgrade to recover my past notes you should have told earlier so that we wouldn't used it now I need my old data and you are asking me to pay money seriously you are worst app in playstore"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Template was so helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"is there any way to easily transfer all the entries into another device? I have dozens of entries (since I already use this app for more than 4 years, with a LOT of entries on each day). When I install and open Journey on another device, the data transferring is so damn slow, maybe 5 hours won't enough to transfer all the diary entries (I use Google drive for the backup). And transferring data often failed if the phone screen is off. Is it really no other way than wait for it forever?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I have ever wanted in a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best of the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Pros: - it works fine Negative: you will get distracted by useless information -Too often I get annoying messages to leave review. Almost daily -when there is no synchronization, I get a big red alert. For me it is not an issue, but it is impossible to get rid of it unless u synchronize."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I feel more open on this journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"(This is a reminder for myself.. Coz i forgot Ive already done it and uninstalled it before). 7 day trial/yearly subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All of my entries have disappeared and I can't find them. And the app won't let me update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I've always loved journaling, but this app takes it on another level"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but they've conveniently forgotten I paid for lifetime premium. This is the second time this app has forgotten it was paid for. This time, the instructions on how to ""restore purchases"" just takes me in a circle. I love the app otherwise, but I'm not going to pay monthly subs for something they previously agreed to sell for life on a onetime basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm a Lifetime subscriber, just changed my rating from 5* to 1*. App support is not responding to my issue: I was overbilled for 2 years (should've been free on all platforms, yet was billed thru iTunes yrs 2 and 3 after paying for Lifetime.) Contacted support year 3, no response. This year had an email dialog with support, but when I requested a refund, they've ghosted me for the past 2 weeks. Hoping this might catch some attention - let's resolve this. Love the app, but resent the over billing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simply does what I need across all my different platforms seamlessly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been great for me to express my daily feelings. I enjoy journalling and it makes me feel better. It's pretty cool with all the features like photos, mood check in and activities. I recommend for someone who needs to let it out, or just wants to journal the good. I do both and it helps me process what is going on with me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for several years, and when I got a new phone, I made the mistake of following their advice and linked to cloud. Long story short but I lost all my entries even though I could see them outside the app. John from their help desk started to help but has now ignored my requests for help for several weeks. Fortunately, I took a backup, which I've managed to load onto another app. Hence, what was 5 stars is now,1 star"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Ever since the AI it's now worse. I used to be able to write from all platforms like mobile & website app. but now I can no longer write cross platforms even though I already purchased the lifetime premium, because that's the reason why I bought lifetime premium instead of subscription. But I feel like my purchase has gone to waste. All the years and hundreds of entries wasted just like that. Cloud syncing no longer means anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app , it helps me in my trading journey. I highly recommend it ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using Journey (Pro account) for many years and it's a huge part of my routine and journalling habit. Really happy with the functionality, calendar tab to scroll back through entries, media gallery view and it syncs to Google Drive with no issue. Customer support (by email) very thorough to answer questions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great App to save/keep information for the future"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Dumbest app developer ever. I deleted data from google drive, and when I open the journey app, it automatically synced and deleted data from DEVICE! how stupid is this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience with Journey has been great thus far. Hoping to pay for it any moment from now. Thanks to the brains behind this great apps. This is the best Diary you could ever wish for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app, user friendly, and the throwbacks are fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yeah this app is a very good app I have really enjoyed it. Thanks to the developers of this app For your effort Few ads and it is synchronised with Google drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for 5 years. One of my core apps that I back up religiously. An excellent journaling app that I highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good for keeping daily diary, with syncing between my phone and tablet. slightly annoying I have to log in for each entry, and not just when I open the diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Delivery, keep it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Have used this app for years now and despite a few flaws in generally a fan. The latest 2 versions though are broken in android (Pixel 8 Pro). Blank screen after biometric login."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, like me.... but genuinely handy saves me writing a diary up most days nice to look back on can add photos etc for that special moment.. OK it July 2024 app plus others mysteriously deleted off my phone ...reinstalled app but I've no idea how I logged in before it's always logged in automatically, now I can't find the last ten years of diary entries ..it wants me to pay for it which I did moons ago & I am at my wits end ...any help would be appreciated I'm stressing over this now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is trash man you have to pay for everything it make me think that E sport made it if you want a really good app try my diary this is not an ad , I just want to help you please just try this app and you will thank me it's the app that O am using right now : my diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid in 2014 (10 years ago) for Premium on both ios and Android, Now Nothing and I'm expected to pay 99$ ? What a scam! RESPONSE TO DEV -- I followed your ( devs ) restore purchase directions, and it did nothing. These people do not honor early adopter purchases!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for over a year. Very happy with it, use it daily. Edit - it's 2024 now and I'm still using it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Updating my review for 2024-- I still agree with my original thoughts and use this app daily!! Genuinely the best Journaling app I've ever used. It's easy to use and I've written in it almost every day for the past few years. I absolutely love this app and all of its features. I have the free version so I can't speak for the paid version but I'm sure it's even better. There are quite a few ads to upgrade but they're not overwhelming at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used it For Years, Love It!! After all this time I wish I could have saving by category."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't bother. Saving your entries to your cloud is a nightmare! Not worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since many years and bought the Android only premium version at a time when it used to be very affordable and there were no subscriptions. The app has been and is still good. At that time there was only Diaro as a true alternative but today situation has changed. So many new Diary and Journal apps are there which are free or have a small one time purchase without any nagging and subscriptions and are very good too. Many Notes Apps can also be used for Journal writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journalling app. I just need to be better at spending the time to use it! I like the fact that I paid for it and have the ability to use Markdown to write my journal notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience with journey has been wonderful. Very good app for recording life experiences as they come. You should try it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So angry about this. I was 15 when I had this app and I thought I'd look back to see what I wrote. Now you have to pay??? for 10 minutes of looking around?? this is so terrible. If you want you use this notepad that incorporated a calender then you will now have to pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, but text glitches at times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"have the free version. Don't know about premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"One of the worst journaling apps I've used. Sure the simplicity in UI is nice but getting your data out of this app is one of the worst I've ever seen. First I have to go to each individual post. Then I get a .json file as my export file? No option for PDF? Or even a simple .txt file? Don't pay for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for a number of years and have a lifetime membership. Then today I find that I can no longer access it on any of my devices using Google."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Just found out that Journey has two AIs in it (including Gemini). The AIs can summarize your entries or answer questions about your entries. Which means that they can read your entries. Gemini clearly says on its website that human reviewers can see your chat so you shouldn't enter self idenfying information. For a Journal, this has to be the most atrocious upgrade. A journal is meant to be private. You shouldn't use people's journal data to train AIs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Recently google has flagged this developer as unverified, and google warns me that my drive data is at risk. This is a serious concern."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just wonderful ,what i needed ,nice👍👍👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a really good game and I have nothing to say"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. It exceeded my expectations. I love being able to have an easy journal that can be done efficiently and easily. The paid version and desktop version is worth every penny. Would make a really unique gift. I use it for a personal journal and to keep track of art projects and church events as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The templates makes it so much easier to use. Totally love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Why is a membership so unnecesarily expensive :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I set a reminder to use it every night before I go to bed. I love how easy it is to use and how clean it looks. UPDATE: I've been using this app for 7 years now! I absolutely love going back through that days journals from previous years before I journal each night. I highly recommend this app. 🩷👍🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience has been exceptional. I love how there are templates that one could use to improve his experience and also keep a track on himself. Overall I prefer this app. It's cool 😎 to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"On my journey Diary journey nots update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app until it charged me 50 freaking dollars for a free three day trial. I've tried contacting Google and tried looking for customer support from the app, but I can't get ahold of anyone. It's aggravating being charged so much for a freaking journaling app on top of it supposed to be a damned free trial. Not much of a trial if it charges anyway! I hate this app, and it's overpriced nonsense, charging 50 for a year when the app barely works and has awful AI is insulting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had a very bad experience today. I used this app a few years ago. I liked it very much because I could save my diary in a Word file. I haven't used this app for a while. I wanted to use it again today. As a result, I spent the whole afternoon trying to get the phone to connect to my computer and work. And my original diary information was lost. The introduction of the app was very tempting. But the actual experience was very bad. I am ready to delete it completely and don't think about it anym"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Can't install app Moto g24"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app is great, but being constantly spammed with them begging me to pay for the premium version is very irritating. I have no interest in paying for a journaling app via a subscription model. If there was a one-time purchase I would do that, but I'm not paying $50 a year for something I can do for free with Google keep, just more tediously."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What's not to love about this ""platform"", dare I say. Really like the features, and the upgrade is affordable. Haven't done it yet, but certainly considering."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My journal for years now. It"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"For developers to think it was a good idea to swipe our entries to the point of no return with no warning with this update is fuct up. I'm not able to open the app at all on my primary device. This issue defeats the purpose of the app & its supposed objective as it pertains to long time supporters of the previous version of this app. We trusted this app to retain all of the information our minds couldn't. And now? Poof."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent customer service. John from the customer service team was amazing as I needed help with transfer data across. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Woks great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app to record my diary for about 10 years. Can search & add photos. Really wonderful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Doesnt take auto back or give alerts back up is not taken , i lost many journal entries and drive back up was able to restore only 1 yr old journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"With every update, it gets worse."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy to navigate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After purchasing a lifetime subscription to Android in the past, I am experiencing an inapp popup today that is demanding 150e for guess what, a lifetime subscription. On principle, I'm not paying twice for something I already purchased."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wrote in this for about 6-7 years. One day, it simply stopped allowing me to open the app, I'm absolutely devastated that every note, story, poem, and thought I had wrote is gone and unretrievable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've always been someone that journals, but have lost some through the years. This syncs up regularly and protects my entries from going missing. Also has really cool add-ons like location and mood tracker. Love it!!! Update: still loving it!! Been using this app since 2018, it's 2024 & I've just this year decided to pay for the advanced version. Works really well even if you don't want to pay for it though! Highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I really like how smooth and clean the UI looks like. Some suggestion : (1) being able to swipe/switch between images in reading view without having to click to open it in full screen. (2) option to make the app screen invisible in app switcher preview. (3) tag manager to view and eddit all tags you have. (4) being able to set more than 1 reminder. Edit : after log in on a new device and download my journal, all my entries with multiple images got their image order reversed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Help me to get the all apps to complete the google play store and vivo y81 then phone settings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Outstanding App for journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too useless I cannot even login to my account with my google account also I can't make a new account by another email because of the meaningless errors awful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write my feelings there and it's great to put it somewhere who nobody can judge me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app for almost 10 years. It had been my go-to journal for nearly a decade, and today I discovered that the calendar feature has been taken away, behind a subscription paywall. I now have to pay just to be able to access my old journal entries, something that helps me with my healing. I have to pay just to be able to access those, and to download them, and to then delete this app. Very sad that this is happening. Will be uninstalling soon. Guess it's back to carrying a book."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great. backups of your entries make phone crashes or upgrades seamless. biometric login also works really great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Pretty good daily journal. However, it is not private at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still loving this app. Temps, forecast, feelings as well as the days events captured. We'll worth the upgrade. Love this little app. I purchased the premium edition so that I could attach more than one photo as the old saying goes...a picture is worth a thousand words."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like to use it to track my gym and travel. I am sure i used to be able to type in landscape, now only lets me type in portrait, so i have reduced my rating by a star."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"While I was within the 3-day trial, (a very short trial. I must say) I was offered a discounted one-year subscription for about half the cost of the regular subscription. I thought that was pretty good since the regular subscription was too expensive in my opinion. However, I was still charged for the full one-year subscription. I have tried to contact customer service, no response at all. So I'm paying twice for the same app. Update--I've been bounced from one ""help"" to another. No help yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to access, I like the interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like to know what to face and live day to day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I hope a cheaper version may be available. Very useful app. ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dude this app is the best. I started out on the web version a year ago and use it for scripting and journaling, it's just awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have loved using Journey for years. Now can't sync and can't find any help. Can you help me?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well and meets my needs to digitize important and not so important milestones, reflections and memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I do like this app so much. I think cool it care about me I like write. Down my thought going to. Thing deal later I well spring thing but I do like journey sure it great. I behave hard keep up like it it s good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not paying for this. It's not that great. Use Keep app or other note taking tool instead. These 'journals' are scams."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's helping me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good: everything except ads Bad: ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use application for daily diary entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Lots of great updates over the years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its good, i can grattitude journal and not have an add in the middle of writing, overall a good experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has been a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good journal app, but at $50 annually, the subscription price is something to consider."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Passcode is not syncing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank you so much, it helps me keep track my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great way to jot down your thoughts. The app has a lot of uses and helps in various ways, not too overwhelming, just what a user might be looking for. I'd give it a shot if you need a journal app. I download several and have only stuck with this one for over a year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Way too expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been a long-time user of Journey and have found it to be an excellent journaling application. It offers a wide range of features that make it easy to record and organize my thoughts and experiences. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and user-friendly journaling app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent for taking notes in church!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ilike it,very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It was working great until they added all the new stuff this last month. Doesn't show past entries. Hard to synch and numerous problems. Give me back the easy to use I used for the last 7 years. I don't need all the bells and whistles"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love how you can access saved entries from years back evem after changing devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app and would give it 5 stars if I could. But they removed the check box bullet from the toolbar and no instructions seem to line up. Bring back the check box! EDIT: I found the ""Task List"" is a type of bullet function. I tried to get it from the instructions and couldn't find anyone to ask."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Because I wouldn't but this app I had alot of things journaled in here anf it is all deleted! I had hours and hours of Journaling gone! This app deleted everything!!! This is the worst app i have ever had on my phone!!!! If I could give you negative stars I would!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wanted a simple journal that is secure and could change the themes maybe. Not a subscription service plastering you with ads and asking you to login amd requires you to pay to extend your storage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: I have now been using this journaling app for about 4 years. And I still absolutely love it. Using this app I have journaled more in the last month than I have in the past 6 or 8 months. It helps me to get my thoughts down quickly and then go back and make grammatical changes when necessary. I find I put my thoughts down throughout the day instead of waiting until the end of the day to journal and keep my thoughts current. I started using the app about a year ago and I'm still loving it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app before but it's been so long I don't even remember the account so I just made a new one and I'm using it as a work journal since I'm not allowed a notebook at work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app makes journaling so easy,simple and fuss free. I've been using it for an year now and it's my go to when I need to display my emotions through words"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I use it to record dreams, and nothing else. No attachments or anything except audio."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for writing diary and study!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"A bit of a miss. Looking for a journaling app, and this one seemed to be well liked, buy to have to pay a subscription fee to have even a single additional journal really killed it for me. I could understand having to pay a one time fee, maybe even 99 cents per, but not a freaking subscription fee. Nothing in the subscription made me want it anymore either. Also, the text editor was a bit garbage, causing words that I backspace into to duplicate, making writing the journal very difficult."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for a day. Does what I want. I can put entries, it saves the notes in calendar style, you also can add files like video recording or voice recording."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Been using it for a while. Has allowed me to collect my thoughts, notes, recollections, especially during stressing times and is easily searchable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Want REFUND. Logged in after using for years and was fooled into renewing when old features now only visible if upgrade to E2E service and had to pay to move and export entries. Moving to Diarium due to declining UX over time and non transparent pricing, even after paying USD 49.99 prompted to upgrade to Signature plan to access other features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, but I want to change my old email without losing old data, but I can't."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Unethical billing! After 3 years of premium I cancelled auto-renew, but they charged me anyway and not only refuse to refund me, but wont even respond. Site says they answer ""only if the refund request is approved."" You cannot delete your CC info, they do not send auto renew reminders, and they do not provide cancellation confirmation via email. Seems to be a common issue since their site explicitly says ""verbal abuse wont be tolerated."" Use a different app - this one will only cause you stress."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, love the app. So useful and easy to use!! My only issue is I'm I actually am trying to upgrade my membership to the lifetime subscription (I've just had the annual payment go out) but have been emailing and trying to reach you on the website to discuss paying the difference and having no joy getting a response. This is my last resort, could you advise please?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but all my enteries for over five years got deleted and cannot be retrieved. The constant AI on everything makes a once simple app annoying and cumbersome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I hope to contact the support team. The application updated itself and now it does not open. I have data in it for 4 years now and I am afraid that it will be lost because I did not synchronize the account. I hope the support team will contact me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There is no way to cancel your subscription. If there is they make it extremely hard even when talking to customer service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for what it is. Create journal entries and sync to cloud. Able to add pictures and videos to posts. Simple and effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Double charged on a promotion deal and no response to refund request. I have contacted the help desk, still no reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"EDIT 2024: Too many errors syncing with Google Drive. It stops syncing randomly. I really really like this app. The ability to sync between phone and computer, can add a GIF to an entry are only some of the features I enjoy. However, ever since a recent update, the app keeps pestering me to upgrade. After an entry I write or after I exit and reopen the app, the ads pop up. I would prefer these to actual ads but they're still annoying. Please have them pop up less often. :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cannot transfer membership from android to iphone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome appp"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app !! Even though I can't afford all it has to offer. It's wonderful. I journal in books. And now I can keep it without worries of ppl getting into it. I'd recommend this to anyone that likes to write their thoughts, feelings, ideas and daily lives."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a foster parent and this app has made it infinitely easier to keep track of happenings that need to be reported. Very user friendly and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app I've tried"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better than Day One ✌️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really need search by multiple tags option, not only one tag. Please add this functionality. I'm using this app more than 6 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app would be better if you would have a place where you have your personal collection of frequently used templates or favorite templates so as to allow easy access"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice for making daily notes and I'm sure for much more than that"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a FANTASTIC APP. I paid for a subscription years ago and am now finding more templates and things that I will use more. It is excellent or journalling, documenting, for development with templates such as bible studies and other templates, as well as a cleaning template and it really is a one stop shop for just helping you get your thoughst down, motivation etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Even I am not a premium user I like this app because they offer me to type down in my convenient phone the memories of every new day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me get all my thoughts out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"the app don't sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use, have templates available if not sure what you want to start. can backdate, add pics, emotion, temperature n location even while writing down the journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I hate this app! All of my entries for the past 8 years is all gone... I can't afford the subscription. 😭💔"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I can't save my journal on your web app. It showef saved but then when I closed it and reopened it again after some time my journal was not showing. I refreshed the screen as well. Kindly fix that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app, so it's amazing to look back on my past journaling and see my progress and stagnation.. I'm grateful they kept it for years after I have uninstalled it.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hi, my journey crashes everytime I click on certain entries to view them. This is very unacceptable. Also for years now I haven't been able to find/replace a word within a specific entry, for years journey can't do what even Microsoft Word 1998 has been able to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love the app. Have been using this all for as long as I can remember. One of the first apss I install in a new device. Thank you 🙇"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I haven't logged in for a while and suddenly 5 years (!!!!) of entries are gone! Don't use this app if you want to hold on to your memories! Honestly, this should never happen to a diary app. What's the point of keeping track of your journey when in the end all your memories get lost? I'm so devastated"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There's a glitch that won't allow me to paste text from the clipboard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best app I have ever paid for. Five years of journey, and it's going forward."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👌🏿"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Got to be one of the best out there, and secure. Staff response fast if you have a problem. Well pleased with this journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just signed up for membership and my previous entries are all gone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am so disappointed now. I upgraded phones and transferred everything, but after installing journey again all of my past 5 years of entries were gone. I never had a subscription so how is that right that you hold them for ransom if I don't start a subscription now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't write reviews for any apps over here. I'm here for the first time for my favorite app. I'm using Journey since 2020 and it has made my journey memorable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"""Mindful journaling"" seriously? Unfortunately this app become such adware that I can not use it to journal but close and ignoring those monthly/annually membership with discount countdown everyday! Seems like the devs change there focus to prioritize profit by any means rather than user experience i purchased this as one time apps on both Mac and Android and paid for what it seems like one time purchase and I was happy with what I got. I DO NOT WANT YOUR MEMBERSHIP PLEASE. Gone from 5 star to 0!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app gets one star for charging money to give entries a heading. It's disappointing that giving entries a title is a premium feature. And the app doesn't sync settings. Customizing the app after ever installation is a pain."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not only does this app charge you a huge price for each platform. (50 bucks but I did get 50% off for the first year) but then they gaslight you if you leave a bad review. I'm not lying about your prices you are and you should be ashamed. What a joke!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app for 5% people"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best App you can use to document vital data, works multi-platform & syncs in realtime"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for jotting down one's thoughts & musings!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what i need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The Journey app does have a screen lock, but the app preview window still reveals the content without lock on screen in the Android app switch window."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do NOT subscribe to this app. The customer service is non-existent. I subscribed to this app in 2022 and quickly forgot about it. Fast forward 2 years and I had forgotten this app even exists until I was charged again for the subscription without notice. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel and get a refund but I can barely get through to anyone. Its been a completely unprofessional interraction and it seems they rely on you forgetting you subscribed so they can take your money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I changed my review cause I have two entries here and they have a bug. Half of the view for the entry (for both of them) are just empty white space, I could only view the content of the entry on the other half of the screen at the bottom which is a hindrance. I hope this gets fixed, this is a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's easy to use, but every time I open the app it presents me with a pop-up for subscription, which can get annoying. If that can be disabled then 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for many years. Recently I contacted live chat to help solve my sync issues. All steps I followed to upload info required. And guess what, feel like I've been ghosted. I have no other contact info to reach out to in order to fix my issues. This is my last measure to warn other users about the poor customer support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Potential to be a good app. But as soon as you need the support for any possible small thing it destroys the experience. I'm a member and have been waiting for a chat reply for 8 working days now. How can the yearly membership be so expensive if there's no support? Don't recommend the app, there are better alternatives out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. I've been using it since 2018!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so far Great for recording workouts plus other good templates on the free feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Very very slow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is good, works well enough. My only complaint is the constant pop ops every time I open the app. It's always trying to get me to buy the paid version or leave a review. Even after I make a journal entry I get a pop up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice journal I opted to get the lifetime membership, but I'm not sure it was completely worth it per say hopefully they'll had something really groovy make me feel better about it lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost 2 years of data in an app I pay 29.99/yr for. Unbelieveable!!! Do not use this app!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for vacation journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT THEM TO KEEP BILLING YOU FOREVER. The app works fine, but billing does not. They have charged me for a year's worth of subscriptions twice after I've canceled, I have documentation, emails, and Google Play proof that I canceled, and they have STILL charged me. And when they email to tell you that they have charged you again, they include ""contact us if you have any questions"", yet there is no contact link. LEARN FROM MY ""JOURNEY"" AND SAVE YOUR MONEY."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to track what food I ate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"been using this app for a year now..it helps me cope from sadness n loneliness"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful, and so many features without having to ""upgrade""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Obsessed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Interface is nice, but they trick you into adding journals, have poor backups which made me lose half my journals, and then when you are trying to depart from app they force you to buy premium version to download your journal logs in a proper format. Better to use microsoft word where data is safe and securely backed up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. Journey connected my account to someone else and won't restore my access. Years and years of data lost from my paid service. AVOID."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They are not honest and very little response from their end. There is no guarantee of service so basically no refunds if the service doesn't work for you and there are limits after you buy the full version there is another paywall for more storage later. The files are not in markdown and no way to retrieve your work. They end up owning your data and have no way to get it off their platform. Plus a lot of futures that I would like to see are missing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Loved it, but when I went back to use it again, they started charging $50 a year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app helps me express what is in my mind about memorable events... And also helps creating memories! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal writing app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Y'all have everything I need in one place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Don't have to use calendar in phone. With this I can input what I want without any reminders from the calender. Update : it's 2024 and still using it... Don't need anything else"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Online Journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Is there a way to download the photos/videos you put on the journey app back to your gallery because I the app is losing a lot of my stuff I m losing my photo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's beautiful. But it doesn't work. It keeps saying, “your device is offline.” Why does it keep happening? Anyways, bye."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Those pop up ads don't bother me anymore. Maybe it cooled down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"this is not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Top quality"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It never said anything about paying for using it, and the ads are not fun to deal with very disappointed, especially since they make it look good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A very good, even robust, journal app that allows photos to be attached and much more that I have not explored."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have 2 custom templates but the same one is displayed no matter which one I choose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you Journey 😊 The best journaling app ever!! Helped me a lot getting through tough times and being a better person by journally daily. Amazing features and very clean calming design 👌 have been using this app for years, and a few years ago, I got the premium version. Worth ever penny. !! Good job and keep up the great work ♥️♥️♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I have be good bi like write down lot stuff get five star"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Angela. Love this app it awesome but do keep on the phone like do keep writing in it I give five stsr"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stupid that you should pay for such a simple app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still using it every day, the best there is for journal and diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Wish I could afford the paid version but the free version is decent enough to make me keep it. Thanks it has been a new page (no pun, 😀 intended) in adjusting to my empty nest!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't pay, don't buy!! My 5 years record dissappear once i started to pay for the monthly subscription. Doesnt help at all. All 5 years record was dumped into trash. And i got no response from the company!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to vent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. Keep up with my daily miracles!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. Does everything I need, along with a cloud backup facility, in case of loss of my mobile"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Usable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful, if you let it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Bekar hai bhaiya 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Even some feature need to pay but for me , its enough to use free feature for write journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Era bine daca puteai face un backup pe dropbox la arhiva. In rest este super. Ca si alta problema este ca la chrome nu poti pune parola. UPDATE. Chrome password it`s working flawless. I`m very happy with this app. Update 2. The app is very good in 2024"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using journey for a few years and I really love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and have subscribed to the premium version although the free version is quite good. As an avid traveller, the atlas feature is cool and a great addition. The things I'd like to see added is affirmations, mood chart graph/statistics, Google fit sync, and possibly meditation exercises to make using the app a truly mindful experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad news when covering up the good news In God We The People not programmed Trust."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is 4 stars because it has served me well for many years now. But in general, the Google review system is dishonest and useless, since it is easily manipulated and not properly moderated for abuse. Do not trust any reviews."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. It's safe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Functional and simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Horrível, não da pra fazer nada nesse app sem ter que pagar Até pra adicionar uma foto ou uma font diferente Até o bloco de notas que já vem no celular é melhor que isso"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal application. User interface is clean and sober."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"After the latest update the app randomly crashes when navigating between entries. For reference, I am on Android 14 on a Pixel 7 Pro."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to give my hand a break from writing on paper from time to time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"$50 a year. 3 day trial, but paying is mandatory."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best & only journal I use & actually the longest one I've ever had & used for the longest amount of time... I started using Journey app around 2015. Awesome app, I just get distracted or I forget to journal a lot ... It's hard to get back into it sometimes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I owe journey an apology, I think. This review has evolved a lot, from 5 to 1 and now back. After reading the privacy policy I thought staff had access to journal entries by default, unless you paid. I've been explicitly advised they do not. Further reading of Journey's articles on cloud sync, Google drive storage and so forth supports the response. I retract my comments about privacy violations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great diary,until it was'nt, cannot sync, error A124, help desk difficult to follow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I actually enjoy using this app. But there's a couple things that need to be brought up: the price of the premium version of the app and the amount of advertisement for it. I pay $60 at most for a polished videogame that a team of developers have spend tens of thousands of hours creating, and then there's this app with a function barely more advanced than Google keep that wants me to spend $40 each year that I have it? Even if it were a one time purchase that's ridiculously overpriced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app it has really helped me capture and preserve important thoughts and experiences"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Exactly what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Annoying & unasked for ads in the middle of the morning, like, do you seriously think I will buy a subscription a day after installing your app? Come on!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Endless loading screen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Lost all my data for a year worst worst wasted...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app gets five stars because of it's creative format for inspirational of Journaling.😎👍🏾"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍😎 thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for years and will have it for many more. But as with all precious data make sure you backup and use their auto-syncing code"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Cost to much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I despise when apps that harass you and force you to rate them. I've used this app for years. It's fine. My favorite aspect is that it is on any device (Android (which I use most), iOS, and browser for any other devices.) I have it a bad review years ago, but I still pay the yearly subscription and still use it. It's better than the rest, so I guess that makes it the best. -the one star stays though. Please don't pester people to advertise for you through ratings. I already paid. Leave us alone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant at reminding you of past events, and there is a facility for searching using tags. Writing things down is essential if you have poor memory as I have. I have just started using templates, very useful for organising life, to do lists, meal planners, grocery lists. I use formatting quite a bit as well when inserting messages from social media, altogether the best journal app I have tried."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have a premium lifetime account since 2017. How to take more money from me, since l already paid for lifetime access? Journey created a new group of users, ""members,"" and now they ask for additional 100 euro to access all app features. Greedy and pathetic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Using this app a couple of month now and I finally started journaling after all my life been thinking this kind of stuff are not for me. One thing I would suggest is to make a calendar specific for mood tracking. I mean that the mood of that day will be shown on the calendar itself. Maybe doing it in colour or something. I think that the calendar has a big potential for fast tracking and analysing things like mood in a time prespective and find important patterns."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love using this app. It is simple to add entries. I read my words right off it in recording studio. Then, a year of not using this app, it did seem I lost my information, and it seemed at first all was lost. Then I wrote customer service, and they helped me know the entries were in the cloud. I was so happy today to find out I was wrong, silly me. I also like this app because you can put entries in on the phone on the go or at home on the computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool for Bible journalling. Love the throwbacks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Always getting a B4 error syncing with Google drive. I paid the one time price, now can't use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Give it a shot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is what I need. Despite sometimes it has sync error problems on my certain device that it suddenly stop syncing, everything else is great. The concept is good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased a lifetime subscription some years ago and had access to premium features, but recently they introduced monthly and yearly subscriptions and my lifetime subscription features have stopped working. This is fraud. PS. I have always been on Android and have not switched platforms. I contacted their support live chat but it's an AI bot and the ""request a human"" button doesn't do anything. Sync is also not working. Error B0406 something every time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this since 2022 and its a great app for taking notes about your life. Its basically my Life Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought premium version long time ago. But instead of improving it, they just are killing it. The membership options are irritating me with annoying nag screen to ""force"" user to opt in. The worst is, they once offered full zip export using Android, but now that option is no longer available. Don't belive me? Their help page still containing list of instructions of no longer available features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App sucks. Deleted all my data when I turned on AI. STAY AWAY."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Is this app completely free to use? Or does a person need to pay to use it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Latest update took away the ""force synch"" button. Can we have it back? Been using the app for years and it's wonderful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me tremendously thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Neat and flawless to journal. Amongst my favourite apps. Loving the new formatting features too :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love writing my diary entries in this app because every section is partitioned with the appropriate heading. It's not all over the place and I can easily find my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the back up feature. Quite seamless, I've changed my devices a number of times and I've not had any issues or delays."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Recently ver bad experience with the app. Have lost all the entries of mine for the year 2023 and now I am able to login. Have contacted team on different forums like on instagram messaging, live charlt, no response. Please do the needful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favourite journalling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app is deceptive and fraudulent. Avoid wasting your money on it. I've been using this app since 2016, and they revoked my lifetime membership, forcing me into an annual subscription. Despite superficial improvements in appearance, it's riddled with bugs. The app is overpriced, outdated, and deceptive. Customer service is automated, aimed solely at squeezing money from users. Consider other apps with better features and better value."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Itsvgood to look back on past tboughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"🙄👎👎👎👎👎👎👎🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been journaling for over 22 years. I have tried other apps and I found one I love which I won't name. But Journey seems to be superior to them all so I bought the premium version and will use this from now on. I still love to journal in paper journals but I will use Journey as well. Great app. Love it. Beautiful looking and many great features. It just keeps getting better and better. If I could only have one app...this would be the one. I love it that much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app promise"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am loving my experience! Such an awesome and sensitive app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using the app for a few years. I bought a Premium membership so I could also use my Windows tablet. After an App update in January, I was told to Sync, this was automatic previously. I lost all my entries. Getting comprehensive help was like pulling teeth. I have manged to secure entries up to June 23, all since are gone including detailed entries on two major trips in the last 6 months! I'm gutted! Now cannot use my tablet altho' could previously, they tell me I must buy again!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"paid for the full app can't access all the add-ons or other features contacted customer service three times and they say they'll check into it no response no refund it's been 3 days since I signed up. poor service . days later still no access to the things that I paid for very poor customer service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this. Very handy. I've been using it for about 7 years. There are a few minor bugs; I gave up trying to report them as they never get fixed. However, overall it's still great. Needs a more powerful search system incorporating highlighting and multiple search words."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I need when I'm out and about without pen and paper and get a surge of inspiration!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like it. It has a lot of helpful and useful templates. It keeps good backlogs of notes and all these on the basic version and the best part, NO Ads. 😍😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"mình thích viết nhật ký bằng Journey, mình đã xài journey được hơn 7 năm rồi. khuyến khích xài nhen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've used this App for four years and it was invaluable. I'd stored some of my most precious thoughts and memories of it. Updating regularly helped me through Lockdown and my grandmother's funeral. I would have given 5 stars hands down were it not for the fact the App lost three of those years with one dodgy pairing when trying to transfer to another device. It's taken me 6 months to forgive them and take it up again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy writing on this app. It soothes me, I love the fonts and theme colours. I love how it makes me feel when I type. I love the services such as the cloud backups, now I know my thoughts follow me across all devices and never get lost. Helps me track my mental and emotional progress. They did a good job with this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app has deteriorated to the extent that it is no longer useable. When I attempt to post a message screens come up demanding that I ""confirm date and time. Regardless of my response, I cannot post a message. The app has become useless and I'm cancelling my subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app. I never thought I could get into this, but here I am."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app BUT purchased a few years ago and keeps trying to get me to upgrade ,really annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"changed my review from 5 stars to 3 .... have been using this app daily since january 2019, and now in 2024 I have been seeing that entries start to fall through the cracks and not get synced properly ..... if i have a picture attached to an entry with text, in many cases after syncing the text disappears .... which is very frustrating as it keeps happening. Also I really would like to see more cloud services offered other than the journey cloud and google drive .... i want to stop using google"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is labeled false if Parker j tawzer does not own this app it is labeled false if Parker j tawzer does not own the journey app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Did not save my entries and does not sync between devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I type more on pc than on my phone. This journal is great for both. I just don't understand why I need to make a separate cloud service to use even the simplest search function, or to even look at my entries? I don't need to do this on mobile. Plus, even after making a new cloud service to use those, I obviously can't search through all of my entries from 2019. So I don't see a point on using the most basic functions on Pc. I would rather just do that on mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Removed my entries and asking to upgrade now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its such a lovely app. I have used it since May 2016 till now and i wouldn't trade it for another Update: 2024 and I still have the App! It's amazing!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My most fab journal. I use it all the time to keep record of my thought. I sync with other devices. I hope to buy full version one day. The price is bit too high for ne right now but I think it is worth buying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The color scheme in this app is hard on my vision(s). Other than this, it would get a five star rating from me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The templates are so great especially if you're like me with a big problem with writing down thoughts. I just don't get why text formatting options are tied to the subscription bundle"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I Updated the app yesterday, and it is unable to login to my premium account, and says 99+ entries not synced. I don't have idea how to reach out to support. There is some chat that don't respond. User since 9 years now. Hope someone can help resolve"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Wenn ich die App starte und das erste was ich sehe ein 1-Minuten-Timer ist, dass ich doch jetzt ganz schnell Geld zahlen soll.. Dann fühle ich mich echt nicht ernst genommen. Enttäuschend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Synching, exporting, and especially customer service are all a nightmare."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"An excellent app but recently it will not show overseas location when using photo tag with Google GPS. It works well when I am in Japan but back to Singapore, those photos taken in Japan could not show the location in Japan when posted in the app. Anyone can help/advice?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use journal and always available since on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years! I love it.. and I've tried many others! It's so worth it!!! Customer service/Technical support is first class!! Highly recommend this app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Convenient and handy. Very private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi. Could you add February 2024 to the calendar? It skips from January to March."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app's recent bullying tactics when it comes to signing up for a paid membership are a new low for developers. Starting in 2024, the app has a button that points you toward a discounted annual membership, but get this: it starts a 60 second timer for you to complete the purchase, and if you decide to exit the flow, it warns you ""If you close this screen, you'll never get this price again."" Rushing people to spend $25 (Do it right now!) under a veiled threat is bullying. Cut it out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There is no way for you to refund even you bought for 1 day Very disappointed with Odyssey A.I. – it's clunky and inefficient, failing to meet my needs even after just one day. No refund option adds to the frustration. I recommend using Day One Journal instead for a smoother experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful app for a daily notes for reflections"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this so much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and Lovely app. easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was searching for a diary application, and this is the one I chose. I am primarily using the free version, but I will likely upgrade in the future. It would be beneficial if there was an option of unlock the app to directly navigate to a new journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything in place for 21st century journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The best journal app I've been using for years. Didn't formatting options and the option to sync the data Google drive are best. An option to save locations and use them when creating entries would be useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I will update later if things improve. But so far, I am very much unimpressed. Tried to use the speech to text option, and it chooses the wrong word quite often or it drops out of speech-to-text mode entirely. Or just now... I stopped journaling because it took everything I had already narrated and kept duplicating it and duplicating it. Did it probably ten times before I was able to get it to stop. Maybe more? Hopefully, it gets better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Caters my needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing I love it! 🤩"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app Update: after after not having this app I re-downloaded and found it still had my journal entries from 6 years ago! Pretty awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. I enjoy the simplicity of the Journey format and that I can visit it on the web if I want to. Wish I could do pictures inline (like, put some text, add a picture in a specific spot, add more text underneath)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app love all the features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like all the features. Makes journaling more fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was great, had a premium membership for years, then with an updated, it's no longer recognized, and my entries are gone, fantastic 👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"pls i just updated journal now and i lost all my write-ups. please kindly rectify this issue as they are of extreme importance to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"meh.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy and clean app. Thank you very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have a hard time remembering where I went and what days I went there. This is a great calendar app that allows me to take photos and apply them to a specific date with a classic calendar layout. Good stuff!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. And service in general"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it works for me. I have been using it since 2017. It gives me a record of my life since then, it's searchable too make finding certain words easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"useful app to maintain daily activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"L'app è funzionale, comoda e carina. Ma troppa pubblicità e anche per le minime funzionalità ti tocca pagare. Esagerato"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for an app that do what this app do. I just need to write my thoughts down, tag them, and the best of all, lock them. Thanks, awesome work, keep it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wanted to try a journal out and actually downloaded five! Narrowed it down to two but Journey has taken top spot. Yes, there is a premium option, which I haven't done (yet), but there is so much free content too. Will continue using it for now and see how it goes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I operate a camping and use this to record my guest entry and info- as a camping management app. Perfect. Thanks to developers. Integrates with google and qr code apps. Very useful for me. also use for daily diary very useful 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best guided journal pp I have ever had purchasing in-app is not necessary to truly change your life with this phenomenal app. Just buy the app ... you won't regret it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best thing ever expecialy if you want to keep any kind of records and it can finger lock use without buying but I love it one of best apps ever discovered"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app🥰♥️♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good and effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I loved the journal writing, but I got a new phone and I can't retrieve old journal entries. Years of writing lost. How can I get my old journal back?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this Journaling app. I like that it can be locked and use biometrics, that it syncs and has web access and the templates are great too. I'd ideally like to journal by hand but the convenience of always having it with me, privacy/security, templates and the ability to add pics and other metadata make this a winner. I journal much more with this app than by other means. I've also been able to find a middle ground using attached pics to securely save the times when I do write by hand."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Neat way to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"No women no cry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app with bunch of resources to help you get in the habit of journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app but I wish more features were free though..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate this app. I love its simplicity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for journalling and documenting. I love that you can attach pics etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app. Allows you to sync your entry across devices, also stores your entry to the cloud."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm putting this as one star right now because when I changed to a new phone, it keeps asking me to sign up for a membership when I had already purchased a lifetime license 6 years ago. Also, it only brought over about 4 of my entries with no pics. It was previously synced to Google Drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved journey because it covers all my emotions heart mind and soul ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for the Lifetime Premium in 2018. Then I changed phones and lost everything. Contacted support, they're idea was to repurchase the app. Apparently, ""Lifetime"" is only good for 5 years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I can not change font colour Changing of font color is not possible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's really amazing,it helps me in a daily life , and it helps me get things done"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, I like coming on the app each day, it's therapeutic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is nice overall. But i wished it had more widget options. Like one idea is, saying how much daily entry streaks we already done. And i also hope we can have those quick activities options like the other journalling apps. But i really like the template options especially the planners! Not a lot of journal apps have those. My main journalling activities are just doing daily and weekly entries and sometimes reviews. So I'm very satisfied. Keep up the good work!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Totally useful and get even better on each update. I have used it for years and the seamless integration across all my devices makes this a must for people who need to capture moments as they are. There is much more to be done to make this totally perfect but as is, it does what you need it to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It sucks big time! The app it's self and the company is a huge rip off. Beware became they will rip you off!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app since 2018 with no complaints, but in the last update, the ""throwback"" entries that appear on the top of the screen when you log on no longer show up. That was my favorite part of the app and I'm extremely disappointed. It's either broken or was removed, please put it back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best application for journals I have found. Love that it works with android wear as well. The upgrade is worth the money as well. Update (1-10-24) years later this is still the only journal app I use. If you're not using this app are you even journaling?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"For those who used the new Journey Sync Drive, all your previous saved entries from Google Drive will not be duplicated. It still there. Just go to settings and put Google Drive as the main drive and all your previous entries will be there. Or in the main page, just tap the ☁️ icon at the top left and you can use whatever sync service and that will show your entries. Weird that if you use the new Journey Sync service, it won't sync previous entries from Google Drive. This has to be fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very convenient to be able to access my journal on any device and even print it out via pdf if I want. Update: I'm still using this app 9 years later. I love that it provides memories or all my past entries and that I can search for specific content."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one y'all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I don't currently have the premium version, but from what I have been able to utilize and experience so far, it has been pretty decent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't access the app. It keeps on crashing. I tried updating it and rebooting my phone but it's no use. I'm afraid to uninstall and re-install it because I worry that it hasnt get synced yet. I don't want to lose my precious archives. What should I do?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice dairy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been an incredible way for me to understand myself more, but to also spend more time with God. This app is perfect for written prayer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It was great until it deleted itself when I uploaded to the cloud..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actually found this app amazing and awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm super frustrated- have been user since 2017....member for awhile. Now due to beta updates I can't access my entries made over the last 2 1/2 years! I'm so disappointed as I have a variety of content for personal and professional reasons documented there. If all my content cannot be found I need a refund ASAP. Chat feature is horrible for help too.. do not recommend app any longer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Annoying popups in the free version, makes the app very frustrating to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazinggg app just what i was searching for"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just Experenn's"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Just have to develop the habit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey seems to have lost five years of data sync for zero reason today. Such a gem of an app gone downhill like Evernote."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy and useful. Thanks for a very good customer service too, fantastic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app for me. 🫰🏻☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not so good. Instructions to cancel are hard to find or nonexistent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When writing in the stories coach prompt, when I click done, my entry is not saved. So frustrating. Waste of time. Please fix and make more reliable. Google Pixel 7 Pro."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app does incredibly well and give one a good feel when using it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best digital diary ever 💕💗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Diarium is better because it's clean with no sign up or ads. Journey is too cluttered and has ads always showing for a subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for collecting your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very smooth and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a really good place to keep your thoughts safe. It has a pin code feature. That makes it perfect for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The application is wonderful, but it exaggerates the price for strange things, such as if I set today’s weather, I must pay. I do not understand why this is the case"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'd love an option to hide the content of an entry in the timeline. Sometimes I just want to rant about my day without ever read what I've written ever again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app helped me go through a lot of things in my life when I wasn't able to go out and feel like a real person I really do like it thank you for making my days special you're one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen ♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful for adding quick entries and revisiting memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Первоклассное приложение. Не доступна биометрическая разблокировка по лицу."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for organizing thoughts and information into a calendar."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Captures what is needed. Clean, simple interface. Two years later... Still doing the job. Very helpful for recording the many big and small events that make up a life. Records the peripheral details (weather, location, etc.) that serve as background context. Four years later (2023), continuing to record events, daily thoughts, and other things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Just downloaded this app but it keeps telling me I am not ""connected to the Internet"". So I am limited on what I can do. I had to use the web version but I would really like to have this experience on my mobile. Please let me know if this can be fixed. I will update the ratings when I can use this well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for 6+ years and have enjoyed using it up until now. I lost over 75% of my data, and when I contacted Journey to help me resolve it, they refused to offer me sufficient help. As a result, my data has been forever gone, which is utterly devastating to me because it holds my life memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for many yrs bt the new UI & the paid membership pop-up is really bad..previosly there was an option to go thru tags or entries via them.bt the push for paid subscription has made it bad.done with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is the worst app I have ever purchased. Nothing but issues since day one. I have to change my pin every time I try to sign in. It's cluttered and disorganized. Don't waste any money on this turd of an app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for my journalling needs when on the go / constantly attached to my mobile !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for those who want to write down those important memories and events."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since 2017."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Me gusta mucho la aplicación. Es sencilla de usar y me permite guardar mi diario en la nube y exportarlo luego en varios formatos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this application. Very easy to do and used as well. I would really love to see some of the things in the application labelled for the sake of those who are visually impaired or blind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years and it's helped me tremendously throughout my life..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that you can upload pictures and that there is a search function!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to keep the notes. Have been using the app for 8 years. Wish there was a one time payment fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great customer support!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I loved this for the first 4 years, could email a journal entry, then this stopped working, stopped using the app due to this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have not purchased the premium version, but may. I'm very pleased with the ease of use and the locking feature. It's a very cool journal and can keep entries as well as photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It wouldn't let me sync more than once to my google drive and I ended up losing all the entries because it claimed it synced when it actually did not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to express my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best lah"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my go to app for all my journey milestones. I'm happy now there's a desktop version too that syncs in with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"More clutter and complexities than it's usefulness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really loving diary! I really like the fact that I can dictate and it'll type it for me because I'm a slow typer. Anyway, enjoying it a lot!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So great for avide journalers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Great place to keep daily thoughts and insights. Make sure to set it up to sync your data so you'll be able to restore it even if you lose your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Outstanding"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It wouldn't even let me paste a long chunk of text from my keep note into a new journal entry. It wouldn't accept the string that I got multiple other apps to accept a paste from. I had to first remove all returns/paragraph separations and then it let me paste in my chunk of notes (it was only one page worth of text btw). Not acceptable for an app that just charged me $50! Update: I am not using Samsung or grammarly keyboard, I am using the Google keyboard Gboard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good, has all the features you could expect, a beautiful modern design and a seamlessly synchronization between apps and website (my favorite feature). I would ask for a ""Year in colors"" feature in the calendar page. The ability to choose a color for each day, and then see the entire year colored, reflecting our mood."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"From other reviews here, I see that others have lost import data. I paid membership thinking the money would get me better service only for the thing to hang. One John wasted my time forwarding screen shorts in vain. The thing is hang at 15.1.22. after I bought a new phone So useless an application Refund my membership money ☹️☹️ REFUND MY MEMBERSHIP MONEY GOGGLE NEEDS TO KNOW HOW YOU ARE FLEECING PEOPLE. DAMN👹"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the app, promise. hope they wont erase my entries cause they are my treasures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am premium user, but add Only 1 video or 10 images"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app! very intuitive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for about 8 years. What's not to like about it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sangat berguna aplikasinya"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Finding it helpful for logging important information, quotes and web links."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is great. I'm using it since 2016 for keeping my thoughts and important notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. It is well worth the money to up grade. I look back all the time to see this and that. Changed phones and it all followed to the new phone-no problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey gave me a new zest to continue writing journal. It's awesome with sync feature and many more. Loved it... Five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ It's really a trust worthy app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Issue was resolved. Charge me for upgraded membership But I'm only getting the free version. Can't get any help, there's no phone number. There's a chat room with nobody online. So it looks like I paid $49 for nothing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use, and more options then I require."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this journal essential for keeping track, my memory is not too good so the throwbacks are really useful. I like the ability to change fonts, add photos, I often share snippets of my bible studies, that's a really good feature. So thanks all round for a real good app. I had problems on my old mobile it was not able to cope with updates but now We are cooking on gas!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i use this last 5/6 years, probabaly the best one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Says 3 days free trial. They charged my card, right away. And they don't want to refund my account. I canceled immediately. Supposed to be able to get refund from google, if requested within 2 hours. This was literally 2 minutes. I am so angry!! Liars & sc ammers!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for 5 years. I love the throwback that the app shows me This app emotionally connects with me because it contains my personal stories that I write when I am sad and happy It is a part of me. This has been the best spend on app since I own a phone. Thank you. Hopefully the developer keeps updating and improving this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"About 1 week in. So far, found it simple to use and the free version is sufficient for jotting down notes and saving them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Beautiful but.... $$$! Times are a bit tough guys! Why do these apps have to charge to use them?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App seems to be working much better lately compared to in the past, having used this app for many years now. I particularly like that I can use the resize option on Chromebook to maximise the Journey app - it seems to be much more compatible now on Chromebooks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"AWFUL company! Apps & cloud sync doesn't work. Failed to fix after multiple troubleshootings I did to prove the fault is on their end. Bad support! I emailed for refund (16th Nov) within 10 days, but I was ignored. It is ILLEGAL under consumer laws to not refund a faulty product. Any mention of refund was ignored. They kept pestering me to ""fix"" the issue despite my requests. So, as per their reply, I now ignore them. Selfish attitude. Not to be trusted! Read my full review on Trustpilot!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great, I've been using it to note everything I do just to get an idea of what happens in a day (as we tend to forget). Allows me to keep google cal clutter free. Only wishing that membership was cheaper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"How to turn off the Stories?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I value this app to pay for it. It needs the ability to just add plain colored or photographed backgrounds to your journal entries. Otherwise I find it extremely robust, and very helpful! Keep up the great work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Money Hungry app. They might have developed a beautiful looking app but tbh its a waste when you can compare the amount of money they are demanding and the value associated with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best experience in journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for several years and I love that it is a way to have a journal on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"احترافي وبسيط"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You are buying Premium. Then you buy PC add on. Then, every time you will open an app you will be forced to buy subscription. They want me to pay for the third time. Yes there are addtional functions, but this is you want to get while buying premium. And when you ask to include previous payments into subscription arrogant John refuse to do this. Greedy bastards"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: The new Journey cloud sync was often error syncing. How to turn off this service? Cool apps for self healing, self expression and also maintaining mental health. This is the only journal app I keep since its easy to use, well organised and also have a good template and its suitable for beginners too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have only used this app in the non subscription access. But it is really great for my mind dumping journaling. All the features I have access to are excellent for the purposes needed by me. I absolutely recommend the use of this app for all your journaling needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for over 6 years now. What annoys me is that I had purchased the premium version of Journey back then, had access to it. And one fine day you upgrade your app and change the pricing system so I no longer have access to the features I paid for and basically the membership I paid for went to a waste. To top it off, I use the app on my ipad too but the little benefits of my previously paid account does not apply on the apple system which just sucks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, very good support. Update : this app continues to provide exactly what I need. Journaling is hugely important for self reflection and personal growth, and Journey is a fine tool to accomplish this. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Search functionality could be improved with highlighted search text which is far more useful than adding random fonts, backgrounds, templates, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great place to express your thoughts and reflect. I like the user interface and all of the perks of membership so i went lifetime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been a subscriber for years and I honestly don't see myself ever using any other app for journaling. I LOVE being able to sync my entries throughout my devices so I can type it out however I feel like it when the mood strikes. I wish we were allowed more attachment space but that's a little nitpicky haha."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The ""Throwback"" feature changed but the help got me going again. Support is good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over a decade. It's obviously great for journaling but I love how it shows me old messages from previous years. It's a great reminder of the experiences I've had or the thoughts I was dealing with. The app is great and the website is easy to use too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really don't like this app. I bought the premium version because it said you could customize your journal but the only thing you can customize is font attributes. There aren't any themes for a basic journal the themes are all on specific subjects like mindfulness. You also can't add a picture and audio to the same entry. I thought I would be able to add a picture and then audio to explain the picture but I can't. Thus app is very limited in what you can do. Will ve uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best JOURNALING application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling app! And their customer service is exceptional!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it provides me easy access to my journaling, and keeps it for later refrence."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love that I can sink across my android, pc, and ipad! Great layout, easy to use, all around best journaling app I've found 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very bad app. I had bought lifetime subscription but it is totally useless. I have been trying for a long time, but I am not getting any response from you in live chat. Kindly refund my money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for my daily thoughts and growth :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bought Premium but faced additional fees for membership. Switched to Diarium - better app, no surprises."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it with all my heart... It's my little life saver"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I had paid premiun. then unistalled the app. now I installed it again and I do not find my files. please help me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling. I've been using it consistently for three months and sporadically for several years. (Make sure you back up. I thought I was but wasn't and lost two months of entries when I lost my phone.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i'm extremely disappointed with this app. i originally got this app about 2 years ago, i treated it as a vent journal and i had so many memories on this app, good and bad. i was never very consistent with the app and i would go weeks in between uses, and tonight i felt like journaling. i opened the app and every single entry was gone. there isn't a trace of anything i ever wrote in there. i tried using the help desk and nothing would even come up when i tried to get help. this is a horrible app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you for a stable and well functioning app... ☺️ 👍 Kindly bring in more customization options if possible..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App Alhamdulillah"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of A kind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's quite easy to bypass the security or passcode system. Just reinstall the app then enter your gmail that's already logged in to your phone. Can you guys add security in the cloud so even if we reinstall the app, its still locked."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app.. it's very simple and easy to used.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The application is really good but unfortunately when i installed it for the second time it didn't want to connect to my previous email and when i tried another one it didn't want to connect and i really want to use it since i had a lot of things in it. [Edit]. I fixed the problem, and the app is really good keep going."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just new to it bur I like it already"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great journal app and I use it daily. I love how it has throwback memories for you to review. The customer service was top notch when I had an issue with billing, super helpful and quick responses. Highly recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was lit and did really started liking it. I did use many apps before but this is the ONE."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Been a user since 2018. I purchased a lifetime premium on both Android and IOS app back then. The Android version suddenly refuses to restore my purchase, the IOS app I am still good there. 2 stars for the developer shadiness of taking my premium version away but then telling me to pay again (99$!) to get it back. I default to the IOS one as it allows me to still use it freely,having paid (5 years ago) for both. No dev, I don't have a receipt for 2018 but you do, and my $ too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for what I need for the multiple devices I use. November 2023 I have been using journey for over 5 years now and I continue to come back to it to record journal entries. I also like the ability to download my journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. There are so many great features to it. Upgraded my phone and thought I had lost my entries, but they were all there with the help from the help centre to retrieve them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app really changed my life. I was in a major rut. Now I live in a new state with a new job and life is great! I would like to see a widget or shortcut for specific entries. IE my quotes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i personaly use this to journal my dreams as i embark on my spiritual journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Unnaturally an easy to quick read."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free - was looking for a free Journaling app. This only gives a 3 day trial. Misleading. Will delete"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"*Edit, +1yr use* Prefer this to simple word processor and other app tried. I have Journey for Android phone & Windows computer. Don't want internet journal; deactivated. No subscription. *Overall*: Very good. Cost comparable to book journal with more features, ease. Great searching. Add Photo. Phone + Computer integration changed how I journal. Templates and Sets of Prompts that update ~ seasonally. ~~How to Improve~~ Ability to favorite templates Ability to save when type in Coach Prompt box"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Providing more features than I need yet still has an easy and efficient interface. It gets better with every iteration. Just an update after 7 years of use. Still a 5 star app that continues to get frequent updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Nice UI and many templates available but on a free version you can barely do anything, can't even bold your text or create your own template.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use and a helpful took to keep your memories and photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for almost 8 years. I know it's a journal, but as a writer, I use it for those purposes. The tagging system really helps with it. The layout is pretty good too, and unlike many apps like this, it doesn't have an overwhelming design where every feature is out on the screen at once. With 1302 entries and 2976 days as of today (you can see these stats in the app), my only hope is that this never gets pulled from the store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The new update keeps crashing, especially and using the search bar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I hv been using this app since 8 years..i absolutely love this app...great to recalling ur memories but now it seems like having problem of not uploading hd quality pictures..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app in lots of phones and never, ever gets down, fits perfectly to all my needs on those kind of the app, mix or diary, journal, just notes, etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journalling app ever.would recommend it to anyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was using it for a long time and had so much saved that I didn't have recorded anywhere else, especially some very important poems and I got a new phone and didn't have access to the email that I had connected with the app so I installed and couldn't access my account and I don't understand why. It's very frustrating and it bothers me a lot. I would really like to know if there is any way to get into the account and get my information back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used this app for awhile and stopped for an even longer while. I went to log in today and the whole platform has changed. I would need to subscribe to get my data back. I also noted that data can't be deleted now. Never use a note or journal platform that won't let you delete YOUR data. Ridiculous. No email to inform me of the changes in pay/ use structure. WOW. journals are personal and feels like a violation. I'm going to report it to the play store"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I thoroughly enjoy this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Literally re-download the app this week and all of my entries after May 2022 are missing. Reached out to customer service and sent an email but haven't heard back. Not worth it if you can't guarantee the entries are saved or not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Really want to give these developers a five star for this product, but the fact that they are insistent about that score brings it down. Also, the TOS is difficult to refer to, it should be available for the app user before having to sign in. Every login attempt is an opportunity for loss of security, privacy, data integrity, etc. Otherwise, great features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just getting a good start. Great ""diary"" so far. Update, 5 years of using almost every day. Fun memories in the flashbacks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use, and integrates well with pictures"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this diary for a long time. It's excellent! But I'm finding many of the photos I added appear as duplicates. Very annoying having to delete and add them again. Why is this happening? It seems random. Can anyone explain why this is happening. Duplicate photos only appearing on my phone, the computer version is always perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Although my line spacing for diary entries has always been set at 1, since the last update each line appears to be 2. I have checked my settings and line spacing is still 1. Can you please correct this? ***** Problem is now worse! Previous line spacing issue only affected new entries. While line spacing resolved for new entries, ALL my historical diary entries now have the space between paragraphs removed!!!!! Actually much, much worse! Downgraded to 1* Belated review sorry, change worked 5*"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"2017-Love this app. Keep my important memories in it. 2023 What difference time makes. Not worth the trouble now! Money, the root of all evil. Sorry, but after many years, I'm out of here. You made premium features, ie, backup, disappear. Shame on you. Bye."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I really love to use this app, but after the update it never open for me, I wish you fix this issue so soon!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's NOT FREE as advertised."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No in your face ads like a mobile game. It helps me unwind and reflect deeper into my thoughts. 10/10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good morning everyone around the house, I am greatful for this great wonderful damsel app I just have in my mobile phone today, I thank everyone around me for letting me know about the app today, and I personally promise that I will share this app still it reaching out to people that didn't hear anything about this same app I just made today I am so so happy about this app and I promise to share this app to my family, friends community, college, work, place, church etc and I will tell them of,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dope app. Helps me track the day and times. Important notes. Be honest about your feelings writing in this app of course in a good way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I installed this to use as a therapeutic tool. I hate journaling by hand, and decided to find an app instead, and thank the gods I did because it has been a joy to use. I recently needed access to my journal to show something in treatment and it's was right there at my fingertips. If I can come up with a few extra bucks I will likely buy the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"free version is very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Never"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent App. Helps me in making sense of my life experiences. This puts everything in order. Thank you for your hard work in making this customer-centered and user friendly! Loving this so far! ✨☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this to track my crafting progress with time and pictures. Also to make quick little notes with pictures and and videos of my kids day to day to capture all those little things I will totally forget they said."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was using Journey from 2016. Initially it was a free version. Suddenly they give me an option to go premium version for a one time payment for lifetime. I paid it. But now they are asking more money for premium features. I don't like the company who cheats the customers. So uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I would like to be able to add a quick pic to my journal entry. It's like a digital scrapbook, and I can see using it this way. Clear, clean, easy... those are the best words to describe the Journey app. They added it, or I figured out to use it. One or the other. 😇 Very nice, intuitive interface. I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It makes me feel great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Seemed promising, but left a less than ideal first impression when a ""pay for membership"" dialogue popped up when I tried to use bullet points. Not paying ~7 USD per month just for that given data is stored and sync'ed elsewhere, so have reluctantly removed the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this app been using it since 2017 but lately I can't make any entries. So disappointed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The templates are superb! I love this. Thank you for keeping it up to date and free 😆🆓"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like this app overall but I don't like how it's handling gallery. Imagine if you'd like to add pics that you took a month ago. The app will let you open the gallery where you can see every recent saved picture, but it will load only a limited amount of them, in most cases it will not load what you were looking for. Second way - open a files where it will let you add pics from camera folder but only ONE BY ONE, and no it will not remember where you left, you'll have to scroll all over again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I lost my dad in September and someone suggested journaling as a coping mechanism lest the grief swallows me whole. I'm glad I found this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to put thoughts down immediately. It's healing and helpful and sometimes you just have to get the words out and down fast!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great app I am really feeling good writing on this app.Really it has good features in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Much better than a simple notes app. The template function doesn't work for me. It chooses the same template no matter which one I choose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful if u want to get rid of your addiction to Instagram. Satisfies the desire to post"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years and I love it. Totally changed journaling for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Because it's efficient being on the phone and private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, ease of use and just very friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I've been using it for a few years. I bought premium because I was that impressed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is so annoying. I connected one of my Google accounts and then it connected another one as well. Even though I didn't want that one. Incredibly confusing to use or even figure out simple things. I couldn't sync some of my entries, and I tried to re-download the app, and it just deleted the unsynced entries. Just great. I'm just gonna delete this app. Not worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Impossible to get ahold of customer service. Don't waste your money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"been using the app for 7+ years. my closest confidant <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"free version gives pretty much everything I needed :) the only thing which is annoying is every time I open app there is this ""deal"" for full subscription. Limit how often it pops up and app is perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"订阅制。但免费版就非常可用了，有天气附件位置和自定义标签。没有跨平台但有云备份和网页版，内容可以存在自己的 Google Drive（但无法直接访问）。网页版没 app 做得好，界面不太能看，设置也少，而且 app 能免费用的功能在网页端大部分都放在收费墙后面。免费版无法导出日记！"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing! I'm so grateful this app allows me to use a free version. This app has been helpful for my mental health."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am still within my window to cancel this order. This is not at all what I wanted in a voice journal app. PLEASE CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it hasnt been syncing since 2nd of october"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't save anything at all. Very disappointed, this one looked very good. I'm glad I didn't get the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Finally got used to the app. Not bad, can jot down things that I feel are important to me. Get fed up of it always asking for a rating...hence4/5... So much for paying for lifetime use of this app. Cannot load it onto my new fone and accessing it. WHY?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Perfect on its purpose and ease of use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They deleted all my posts after 2021. It shouldve synced after every post so I'm not sure what happened. Heartbreaking to lose all those posts. I dont recommend this app to people who wants to save their memories. All can be deleted without reason."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is an excellent App well design and with a lot of features. They are a little insistent trying you purchase the subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Estoy encantada con la aplicación, la uso desde 2017 y me encanta. Me gusta como te permite recordar momentos, ubicarlos en el tiempo y en el mapa. Quizás diría que podría añadir más funcionalidades de personalización, aunque ahora el diseño es limpio y cómodo. También mejoraría si permitiera incluir más cosas en una sola entrada, incluir audios, videos y fotos para no tener que crear varios entradas para poder guardarlos. Aún así es la mejor aplicación para diario sin duda."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Never worked properly, never had an account, paid for premium, it was one screwed up experience, and now no refund, Careful what you sign up for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It is a great app but it's subscription in Egypt is very sexpensive according to average annaul salary in Egypt"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great, but we really need stylus support for tablets!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved the app. The functions are simply amazing. Thank you so much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Saya sudah menggunakan aplikasi ini sejak lama. Terima kasih, sudah banyak perubahan penunjang diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very pleased with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my favorite apps! Thank you developer 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish more features were available on the free version tho. Also could you include an option to timestamp every edit that has been made to an entry?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Poor"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Quite better, the app interface and all is great, would've given complete five star if I could be able to create a financial template for my trading, overall it's superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's a great app. It's important in organizing my thoughts, plans, ideas and insights. I like that it works across devices and can be stored on Google Drive as well. Thanks for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey since 2020 and it has not for once failed me. I access my past work easily and on any phone as long as i am signe into my account, I get all my saved writeups without delay. The template options it gives whenever I open a new sheet is a life safer. Thank you, Journey for making my journey in the content world a sweet experience. Kudos to the team as well. You guys made magic ✨."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Annoying. Asks for PIN all the time making it difficult to copy smth from another apps etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app to keep to store your writings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What a great journeys to wander"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks someday I can get premium membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's very limited without paying for premium so it's not fun and funky like I was looking for but it serves it's purpose for sure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had this app way back two years, and I did not last long with it; after a few days, I uninstalled it. This morning, upon waking up, I stumbled unto it again, and I enjoyed using it I feel like I am tweeting but unlike the social media, I post here whatever I want, whatever I feel, WITHOUT the judgement of others. The Journey app is awesome, and it's a five-star! 😊 This journaling app is highly-recommend for our mental health's well-being."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"£47 per year! You should be wearing a mask at those prices. Edit.. I don't care what it includes! It's a rip off."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Edit: dawg they dead🍑 called me a paid reviewer for daylio 💀 i just think your app is bad. i WISH i got paid to say its bad. I thought this app was so depressing to use. its messy and i dont have time for that. i found their article claiming that daylio is so much worse but honestly it just is not. if you want mood tracking. do not use this. use daylio. you dont need premium to use the app, but if you want it its 1 time puchase. on here it was 50 something dollars a year. get a grip. terrible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works good for what I want to do. I wish the quick look back was free and that it would be not every time you log in that it says hey please buy the premium but I guess not super annoying. No ads anyways and otherwise free to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Chech the data policy - WAY too much info collected & shared. Its a hard no for me because of this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall best for basic diary even without payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. I love being able to keep a journal and enter places I am or have been , add pictures to my entry, locations etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works great and isn't annoying yet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is a terrible app. Does NOT do what it allueds, too. Customer service is difficult and unhelpful. I am very sorry I purchased it. I canceled but cannot get my money back. Very disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it gets better with every update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In my opinion this app is amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the experience so faar. Lots of options to choose, highly recommended ♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really helps to write things down so I can let go of the trauma I have had all throughout my life, I hope by writing this stuff down that it will be safe to let go of and clear out my memory of bad things that happened to me, I would however like some reinsurance that I will never loose anything I wrote."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I've had it since 2018. I don't have good penmanship, so digital files are more fitting for me. The things that I can save (text, media, etc) really make this app enjoyable and useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ive been using it for 8+ years. Best journal app eith a ckean UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"OK. I was a little miffed with this app, which I have used for seven years, because for a brief dark moment it or Google Play or somebot didn't recognize that I have a lifetime subscription (on three platforms, actually.) It corrected itself rather quickly, but not before I received a quite helpful reply from John Journey with full details about how to restore everything. Good Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Очень юзабельно! 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this journal software. It is user-friendly and is an extremely useful tool to capture meaningful thoughts. Furthermore, its design enables users to utilize its functionality intuitively. The feature most appealing to me is Journey Cloud Sync, which enables users to access, edit, or create content on multiple devices. I recommend this app to anyone who spends a great deal of time writing. This is a wonderful app for writers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to navigate. I just love It!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dope app! Check it out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. UI is simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, though may I ask for file support for .heic pictures? For some reason, my phone saves my camera photos as .heic instead of jpeg and converting all my photos to jpeg seems overwhelming"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I would love to give this app 5 stars, but it keeps losing my membership history. I have paid for premium lifetime membership on three platforms, and when Windows received an update, it went kaput. Two Apps fixed it once. Next update, same thing, but this time with no reply from Two Apps. Today they want me to pay again for Android."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent, does the job as described"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"was an amazing app. now too much extreme continuous promotion pop-ups asking you to take up paid subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I used this app for years and loved it. The most recent update made the app crash every time I opened it. I had to uninstall the app and reinstall. Years of information, notes, and entries all gone. I'm gonna start over somewhere else."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I thought the app was excellent but it suddenly lost all my journal entries. Very disappointed. However, uninstall and reinstall seems to have worked for now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I personally was liking it until I realised nothing is free?? Like its okay to have good features in premium version but literally all basic features like italics and bold are also unavailable!! Nothing is free apart from just simple typing which you can do on any damn app. Choose something else. Also does not have titles for each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is an excellent journaling app. I have tried many and there is nothing quite like this. Only issue is that the sync feature doesn't seem to seamlessly update my entries between devices on this phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm writing this review in hopes that I.mihjt get a response from the customer service team. The app is good, it does rhe job pretty well and I like the coaching options and templates. I liked enough to buy the lifetime offer, but then I was charged an annual subscription. I sent an email requesting a refund for the duplicate charge and haven't received my refund - even after a month and too many to count emails requesting the refund. Disappointing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use with a lot of functions. I like how I can view entries from a list view or calendar view."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I find this a really useful way of writing a personal travelogue but get irritated by constantly being bombarded with encouragement to upgrade. I would consider a reasonable one-time payment, in appreciation of what I already get (upgrade is no big shakes) but no-way would I get into a subscription arrangement...it's just not that kind of product, appropriate for ongoing payment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really amazing app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought this app by mistake after seeing it listed as a travel blog app. It seemed to have good reviews. I immediately within five minutes determined that it was the wrong app. I went on chat and talked to John, and he refused to give me a refund because he said I should have tried it for free. The ethics of this company are unbelievable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love Journey--just wish I could upload a lot more photos and multiple videos to 1 day. I am paying for a membership and there's a limit of either 1 video, 1 audio clip, or up to 10 images on an entry. Very lame."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works very well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"2nd Review I try to feedback in this review, admin asked me to reach support team... I tried SO MANY times to contact your support team via chat, mail BUT never got response back to solve my issue. Pls let your support team reach me back via email ASAP 1st Review VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE I tried to contact help desk chat and email many time to refund duplicate membership fee for a month and NEVER got response back. I been with this app for years, so disappointed. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I have been using it for a year and it not only has kept me motivated to journal on a daily basis but it also brought my journal alive. I love being able to add pictures to my entries. My hubby bought me a laptop so that I didn't have to use my phone to write my entries!! I have purchased the lifetime version and I am so glad I did! If you are looking for a journaling app look no further! Journey offers so much coaching sessions, templates and much more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good, overall."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for years and neer disappointed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app for self improvement. Recently added more templates and mindful programs. All are awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"there NEEDS to be a way to add your own activities and to select them"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I subscribed for a 3 days free trial, but the app immediately charged me for a year's subscription without a single day of a free trial. I firstly noticed the problem on 1/9/2023. The team responded to me via email and said that they had sent my receipt to the billing team on the same date. after that, I've keep waiting and asking for update both via email and live chat, but l've gotten only automatic reply until now.I don't know how long it takes to get a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sometimes i need to dump my throught and write down my Life's Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"irreplaceable for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it. absolutely love it. I've been using this for 5 years now and even taught my mother to write here. Its a perfect platform for journaling. I won't recommend anything else than this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it very therapeutic!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ngl I used it for years when I switched phones nothing transfered but at least I still have it on my old phone. I use this app to make love letters for my girl everyday before I start writing is out. She loves it! I think it's worth the 5 stars. I don't even pay for nothing. The basic app by itself is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is a disappointing journaling program. Most features don't work across platforms. You only get a 3 day trial grace period which is not enough time to evaluate. I highly recommend not wasting your time on this app, or you are on the hook for the price of $29.99/yr plus tax!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"On Device Backups are a paid feature. Better go with Daylio or any other app. It is essentially a walled garden."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is one of my favorite apps. all tho I don't write as often as I'd like to but there are all kinds of tools to help me improve my writing when I do find the time. plus I have all my Journaling in one place and as long as I don't forget my email I've been using for years now I won't lose my journals. I've lost so many paper journals over the years. what I wouldn't do to get those back. .I doubt I'll ever lose this one unless I come down with a case of severe amnesia."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Easy and useful and flexibility"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Download, go through the set-up, then get a whole 3 days free. Nope"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just spend some time, and you will love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I would like a refund"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant application. Being using it since 2015. The memories are priceless. Great user interface with necessary features. Developers, well done! Thought was put into this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been my journal app since 2018, and I couldn't be happier with it! It has everything you need, and is incredibly user friendly. I highly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cannot express how disappointed I am with journey. Its by far THE WORST online diary I've ever used. I started using the free version then paid to upgrade, its beyond basic, doesn't update, limited fonts, it's just awful and I thoroughly wished I invested my money elsewhere. I will NEVER renew my subscription! Ever! Oh and NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"quite nice and useful throughout the years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My journey😍 I've been using this app for 7 years. I love it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Saya sudah pakai aplikasi ini selama satu minggu dan ini sangat bagus. Semoga kedepannya tetap bagus dan tidak ada error. Semoga data-datanya aman. Terima kasih."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"★ ★ ★ ★ ★"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"رائع"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I need to access to many devices with the same account and find my entries in all of them .. but every device just show its entries .. how can I solve this problem"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very very good app. Especially voice journal recording option with google.drive sync is excellent. Keep up good work team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice easy journal app. Can add pictures etc. Great for recording events or just daily diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"seeing past journal entries as old as 6 years makes me so happy. Seeing how my life got better, things worked out my way, what thought patterns changed and need to be changed. I like that i can sync it with my android and ios devices. the only thing that can be improved on is having some template that can act as a diary for info/thought dumping"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I don't need all the bells and whistles, but I paid for the year with the half-off offer anyway. It's easy to use, and I look forward to exploring it more. I personally don't use the coaching but it's nice to have it available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never lost anything. Works wherever I am. Easy to use and understand. Would recommend it to others. The interface is nice and it works well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great expirience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this! Needs bold and italics as free features at least"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this since 2018 and I can't tell you enough how it has helped me go through depression over the years. I hope I'll be able to afford using the Premium features soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for last minute notes and never forgetting your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great all the way around. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It helped me a lot to understand myself more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Always use it to journal only when I go on vacation so there really isnt high expectations from me, but its still a good simple app to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love having a record of what I've done and especially like the ""throwbacks"" each day reminding me of a month ago, a year ago, two years ago, etc. Love this app and recommend it to all of my friends. 3/14/2022 I've been keeping this journal since 2015. I've set it to remind me each evening at 8 pm to write and it's very much a part of my evening routine. I continue to recommend it to everyone and often send people things from past entries to remind them of things we've do. 8 year user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just make it cheaper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. Worth the premium. Great features !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app very much. Beginner friendly. I keep track on my stuffs, very useful since I always forgot something. No ads, big points for that, devs. All in all, 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Feels like abandonware"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I use it all the time. Recommend you add instant updates to the cloud so I don't have to press the button, increase fluidity between laptop , cell and desktop, also better spell checker, auto tagging is awesome!!! But please do add an option for organizing a book because we are creative people who are journaling to write our life stories and I know you can't read our stuff legally but I've marked all my pages by book 1, book 2, book 3, and so on but I need help organizing it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"very good app great work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to app for journaling. However, I wish the app has the option of including more than 10 photos per day and the photos can come from any source instead of being limited to the photos in the phone's photo gallery."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write my journey, i happy, i cry, i sad, i alway write in app all everything crazy. I emprove my emotion avery day, i fell relax writh that. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is fantastic and keeps getting better. BUT...I'm a premium member & after getting a new phone I keep receiving offers to become a premium member. It's really annoying, otherwise I would give 5 stars. Changed to 5 stars as Developer's suggestion fixed it. Tx. Initially reviewed in 2019, still using the app in 2023 & it keeps getting better!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I been using aince 2017 and i really love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm high now.. and I find this idea fantastic!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"As a premium user since 2016, this is the best app for journalling or diary writing. My only request is, I hope instead of attaching image, I wish we can insert image in the journal entry we're writing. So it looks kind of like a blog, something like that. I would very much appreciate it if we get that feature! Much love x"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's helpful to write what i do today"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for building an organized life. With the added new features, I don't even need an organiser or to-do-list app. Journey has made things easier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Comforting, helpful, feels like I'm writing down my strengths each time I describe my day and feelings. Makes me feel good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app's interface and features are amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have history on this that goes back several years. Something amazing happened to me in 2011 and I started Journaling ever since. I love reading Something from 11 year's ago. Amazing app! Michael"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey everyday for a number of years and it's really great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic journal app. It's been my go to Journaling app for more than 7 years now, and I have to say I'm considering getting premium just to enjoy the app's features more and support the developers for creating something this beautiful. I had stopped Journaling for some time and to my pleasant surprise, the app remembers my past entries. Not to mention that it's UI/UX is also effortlessly gorgeous. Thank you for making this app; I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: It.is.Best.App.Period. Was happy, but less happy now. The throwback feature from premium seems doesn't work, and it should work like Facebook's throwback, not only static throwback based on exact date a year ago (which doesn't work anyway)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've been writing in a paper journal for 20 years and I thought this would be a more convenient option so I bought the year subscription. On my first entry I had gotten two paragraphs in and the app glitched and deleted everything. For me, this was enough to want a refund and not try again because that's valuable information I don't want to risk losing especially since it happened on the first entry. I tried to contact support for a week with nothing back. I would not recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been a great app. I have been using it since 2017, and I'm finally leaving a review. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"they delete all of my entries!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The payment system is scammy!! Beware! I received a pop-up that said ""half price for the first year if you buy now and skip the free trial. This offer will end if you close this window"" I thought, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get this app, might as well get it for half price, so I accepted the offer. They charged me half the regular price. However, at the end of what would have been my trial period, had I not accepted that offer, they charged me the full price. I've contacted them, no resolution!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good, but one problem, the programs aremt free, there are very few programs that are free, which aren't very useful, I am just saying this app is very good for journaling, especially if your trying to build a habit like me, you will find it useful, but about the programs, in my opinion, some should be free to attract more users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm enjoying the Journey app immensely, but I've encountered a minor inconvenience. At times, I write notes in my notepad app and plan on transferring them to the Journey app. However, the app does not currently support the copy-paste feature. Could you kindly consider updating this in a future update?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Asking for too much money in my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journal apps the here. The first thing this app need is a journal cover when we hit print. It should automatically generate a cover when we want to print. The second thing is to make more journals. I hope they do that in the next update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal App on the App Store, hands down, I even went premium to support develpment. Please develop for the Chromebook as well, so I can go full screen with the app on my Chromebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best ""journal"" app I have used so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"My Journey lasted 2 minutes. Upon installing the app (both on mobile and the webapp) it requires you to sign into either Gmail or Apple. Don't use either of those email services? Too bad. I'm not gonna use a Gmail account just to use this app. Moving on to the next one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hello journey team, please make the font bigger and better. I love the app, the only thing that's bugging me is the text font."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lumayan untuk belajar mengkaji berita dan artikel hasil copas. Jika tabungan sudah banyak dihapus dengan mengganti email, membacanya ulang pasang lagi. Bayangkan kalau ditulis dengan buku fisik 😁 mana gratis pula."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app and how they support Arabic right to left writing all the basic features are free and this is good but the desktop version is sooooo busy I can't log in with my account , why is there just the Google linking for the log in method and its not evenworking, do the classic email password for registred accounts or fix the error, I will give you 5 stars after that , any way this is a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using since 2017. There's been app crashes & bugs but I'm glad to say only a handful of them have been really bad experiences for me. And for those cases, customer support has been really proactive and responsive to help me resolve the issue at hand as efficiently as they can."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very useless app. I stored many important data daily on this app but when I format my mobile phone and installed this app on my other mobile phone then all the latest 1.5 to 2 year data is not showing. Only very old data is showing. You (journey app team) ruined my whole hard work 😭😭😭. I will never save any data on your app again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app and app support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Such a ridiculously expensive app, but doesn't have the feature of adding multiple journals? Consider me out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sorry, not looking to spend 50 bucks for an app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app for daily journal entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've try so many apps and this is the one that I'd keep using. Worth a try."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is easy to navigate and use. I love how everything is timestamped."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I wanted but please add something like title before note I did not see it but 25 🌟 all the way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this app for probably years. Loving the new update guys! It looks so cool. Keep up the good work. I love this journaling app. 😊 Edit: it would be perfect if we could put our stickers or gifs in our journal entries. It would add more character."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Decent but expensive app, poor Customer Service. I was offered a 50% discount in a year-long bundle but was charged full price. Customer service has been either unreachable or have ignored my claims when they finally answered. Before cold shouldering me their last response was: well feel free to cancel next year. I bloody will! Arrogants."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's ok. Could be better could be worse. Does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"2018, Love, love, love. All you ever need. Buy premium and enjoy for the rest of your life. Even if you delete your app, and want to use it a year later, it keeps all your old entries. Worth it! I hope they include a feature that lets you input a voice recording as an entry. Edit, 2023 The only app that kept its word, I'm still using premium even if now it's only a monthly subscription. I still have my lifetime premium... integrity of the highest order.... beyond happy, and forever thankful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is absolutely the best diary/notes that I've used over the years. Nice one,guys."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lately I've fallen into a deeper depression so I found this app on Google and I use their free version. Even with the free version it has helped me a lot in the past days and I'm gonna keep using it. When I get a stable job I will purchase the full version ❤️ thank you for creating this app🫂❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Most things are fine, it does all I want. Exporting to a word document is a bit clunky but I can work around that. My big issue is getting nagged for feedback EVERY TIME I make an entry. The app is great, I use it every day, but please stop asking me for feedback, it's so needy..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still using this app 7 years later. Original review was December 1st of 2015. This app is helpful as I Journal what's convenient for me which is voice to text. I can add pictures and it also adds the location and I can download all of this onto a PDF it's just brilliant!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to note all your travel experience. All that I need is here. Photo, location, voice recorder, etc. Thanks to dev team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to pop in, and just write my random thoughts whenever I want. If I don't have my notebook handy, this is my only other go to. Has given me piece of mind plenty of nights, when I just need to get something off my mind or off my chest. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps a good record"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for an adhd-er with a poor memory"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely and that sums it all!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Overpriced journal app with a lot needless features. There are better free alternatives."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"""I would give this app a 5 star rating, but I have been using this app since 2017 or 18, and back then, it was very easy to understand and check my days. However, after the recent design changes, I find it uncomfortable to use. I really wish the developers would revert back to the old design, which was much better than the new one."""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Edit: I bought lifetime premium, but it's asking me to pay again when I logged in my account from a new phone. My old phone broke. Why is it saying I never bought premium? I am using the same account I have always used. Stuff like Throwbacks I can't look at anymore, even though I have been able to for a while when I had my old phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very great with how it looks and feels and it's bringing up memories and allowing photos. It's very much perfect for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful. It is honestly not as great as I thought it would be for how expensive it is. Tricky too. Once I realized I was unsatisfied, I canceled my subscription. OR SO I THOUGHT. There is some backwards way they want you to cancel it to make it impossible. I thought I did that over 8 months ago, but I just found out they charged me for another year. They automatically turn on auto renewal for payments and do not tell you. Then they charge you without ever sending a notice. Do not recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for the past few years without any issues. However, I recently changed from a Samsung S9 to a S23 phone and when I logged into the app, three months of journal entries, from mid-April to the day, I got my phone on July 29th, are missing. I contacted the customer help to see if it's possible to recover those missing entries and am waiting for an email reply back. I am very upset about this because all of my other entries synced with no problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"every push of a button has appearing ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good to keep thoughts and memories privately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great product. Been using it for 3 years now. I had a minor problem with Synchronization but the live chat person (John) resolved it very quickly. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's paid app 4 k per annum. One should declare that before downloading., Not at the end"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"£48 a year for a diary.??? No thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Premium account works only with one platform either android/ios/harmony. If you changed the phone then you're not in premium any more... Application support recommended to switch back to initial platform (Android in my case). I recomend to select more universal application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for almost three years to record my dreams when I wake up. Other dream journal apps have small character limits which makes it difficult to write everything out, but this one is perfect. The above paragraph was from 2018. I've now been using this app for eight years, and it is now 2023. Still an amazing app and I couldn't recommend more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My All Entries in Urdu Language. Urdu starts from right to left. After Update 3.2.1B, text Align Left to Right Automatically. Please fix it. And add Text alignment right to left. And if possible, add Urdu font. Font Name : ""Noto Nastaleq Urdu"" Thanks Journey Developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Love the app, dislike the constant reminders to rate the app. Always drives me insane when an app won't let me choose to stop getting asked."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Disappointed. Read online this app was a one time purchase of $18, now it's saying it's $60/year subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app.. keeps me Journaling everyday and has the templates I need to figure our what I really want to say and write what I feel.. 🤎"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I rated it 5-star in 2017. It's 2023 now, the app is still amazing ! Have a great feature of throwback memories. UI is friendly, great features. I usually don't buy premium version of any app at all. But, for this, I did buy the lifetime membership plan, because it simply deserves that !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work anymore. Can't even type anything, it just shows loading animation. I even paid for this crapp."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App as a free user is pretty good. It is easy to look back at your journals with the day and time of writing attached to it. Unfortunately every time you open the app the app makes you click away of their promotion for the paid version. Yes, every single rime you need to press the x to be able to use the app. Also it seems that every day is a day with a special limited time offer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Been using it for a few years now and it helps me digest my day and look back at my life over the last few years. I love being able to upload images too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was using this app occasionally for years. Suddenly, the app has been updated and all my entries have been lost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Entries deleted! I've not used this for several months, have just gone in to check my entries and everything has gone! What has happened?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to save memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"**CAUTION** Forced to select the ""free trial"" to see ANYTHING or what it even )offers. Was then charged 55$ for an entire year of something I will not use. Sense when do apps charge u for a whole year at once to start with! Even better I needed that money for actual life necessities but Thanks to journey I no longer will be looking at ANY apps you cant look at without a ""free trial!"" I'm so sick of the world today. Everyone's just looking for a chance to steal, con, or lie to you. & all for $!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a really good experience till today, hope u add microphone feature for unpaid users"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I miss the old, clean, non-aesthetic format of the app. Do you have a switch button to get back on the former look?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Fantastic app! Works great, love adding photos and videos, and the atlas is amazing. One simple change I'd love to see - searching. I write 2k words a day - would be great if, when I searched something, it would be highlighted within the entry and shown already in the thumbnail view, so I can quickly select the specific entry I was interested in. Similar to how search works on Goodnotes! Would be an amazing quality of life feature, and make this a 5-star app. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Helps me write everyday and put my thoughts in order Returning back about 5 years from my initial review to mention again that journalling through this app has definately made me a better person. In a very simple way it makes me realise my thoughts my fears and joys and makes me course correct all the time. I recommend journalling to all with this app a very able support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I want them to bring back 4 photos per entry.Dont lock everything behind pay wall!Good app.I would like to deletr one of my accounts because i accidentaly make it but i dont know how"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for 3 years, now. Journaling helps me to stay sane, as I live alone and sometimes just need to write it all out. Plus I travel with my job, so writing down my adventures is fun and Cool to look back upon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In need capital letter for me yo know you guys more for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome update, I really liked it but there is one bug, whenever I try to view or edit the first entry it opens the second one, and it is npt intermittent it happens quite often or always, rest is pretty good appreciate your efforts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They changed this app so much. Grrr"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Entries for 2 years are deleted afrer i changed my phone even after i sync each and every time and sync it last when i changed then what does automatic sync means"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cancelled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for my daily thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been perfect for the journaling I want to do. I can use it on my phone, my tablet, or my computer, and it syncs between them. I've done more journaling since I started using this app than I've done in a long time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one to maintain my trading journal 😬"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for years. I had a sync issue. They tried to support me. I chose to reinstall the app thinking it would help. I had no idea my unsynched entries would be wiped from Google drive. I don't think this is a good design. I was signed in. For all I could tell my data was on the cloud and just not showing on the Web app. Pretty frustrating. Obviously the sync has been broken for ages without me realising as I lost TWO YEARS worth of data without ever seeing a warning."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app, have become my go to for personal growth and emotional release"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice place to load my thoughts and worries. Bught the premium app to avoid ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty straightforward app. Quite liked it. Would be better without the ads that pop up sometimes. On the whole though nice experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing App. I love the coach's prompts, the app's interface. Kudos to the developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Way better on Android than on iOS. I like to type long diary entries, and being able to sync diary entries across my phone and my computer really helps. However, for some reason I can't copy multiple paragraphs from Google Keep to the Journey app, which is a bummer. I'm using the S22 Ultra now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, clean, and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Everything is good except image link seems doesn't work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great place to keep my personal life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Unable to install it on Vivo X60 Pro. After clicking the install button it downloads the app, tries to install and then go back to install. Emailed the Support but no response from them. I own the app on Windows and another Android phone. I dropped another star for the developer not being able to fix even straightforward bugs such as maps not showing the proper location even with GPS permissions. Worst part is the HORRIBLE tech support for Premium user. I waited for over 20 minutes! No answer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very mindful app to record events in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is really clear and easy to use and the lock is really good for some privacy, it has a very neat and astetic layout too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it very muchhh 🫶🫶💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great application 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A journal app worthy your money. Been using it since 2016."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app Very user friendly Thank you so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This used to be my most favourite app but one day almost all of my journal entries were deleted😠. I trusted this app but it happened just like that? The new update deleted much of the entries. It's just sad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps. It's not cluttered with features and has all the necessary features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simple easy to write in and also shows ur feeling and how much progress u made I luv this app it helped me feel stress free and like I have a person to talk to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using free Journey for years now. It's simple to use and does what it's intended to do very well. If you want a journaling app, I'd highly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Neat but not free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's extremely user friendly.amd easy to use. I find it as a friend to share my thoughts and arrange my life. The best thing: it's templates, lock feature and no ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great way to keep simple thoughts quickly. 7/6/23 Still using the app. It's still 5 stars for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Why writting suddenly gone? I can't see anything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"WARNING: DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THE 3 DAY TRIAL. I signed up for the 3 day trial and quickly found out the app wasn't what I wanted. I immediately unsubscribed (within 30 mins), and now have been charged the full AUS $80/yr subscription for a year that I didn't want. Have contacted the developers - no response. Googe Play refused the refund without a reason. I've also seen other comments in the reviews saying the same thing. It seems like this company has setup the trial to be misleading on purpose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"While I love the app, I am not getting response to a payment query I made a week ago? What does one have to do to get a reply ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal ever! It has kept my notes for 4 years! Sync to any device. Awesome backup... I'm overjoyed with this app performance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THIS IS THE BEST ANDROID/WINDOWS JOURNAL APP!! Been using it for more 4 years now, recently updated with new features - sync, guides, templates, atlas and so many more things. Using premium membership since 1 year, definitely going to buy lifetime membership for sure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extraudinaria app me allegro haberla adquirido es facil de usar :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hey I asked refund 1 week ago. Refund my subscription as soon as possible"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I don't think they encrypt your entries. If you back up to cloud I am worried if it is accessible by their staff (or if it is backed up to GDrive, they should offer to encrypt it). That should be a primary feature for a journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Loved it. But my suggestion is please give the zoom-in, Zoom-out option while viewing the entries that have been made in the diary. Also please give an extra option of adding the birthday & anniversary reminder option so that we can remember the imporatant days. The user interface till now is good. I tried it today to add the template but i did not get it. Also i feel it feel, the template cuts when we insert template. Please give the otion to add manual template"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a sveral months now and this really helped me reflect on myself. Thanks to this I have a tool to write all my apology from the past and gratitude. It's really helpful and easy, friendly to use. Thank you! Much appreciated!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I never want a diary now. Intuitive. Thanks to developers. I'm using samsung note. If you can add the facility to write by pen, it would be grateful. Thanks again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have enjoyed this app. It has been the perfect blend of journal and photo sharing. I love the tags. I love the map. I love the easy search through my posts. I have been a big advocate of the app and hope that it's around forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I logged in after having the paid version and it's loss or erased the entire history!! Please advise. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A bit pricey for us in 3rd world economies but a brilliant app indeed! And just gets better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A beautiful app indeed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite app... I love the night mode and the ease of it, I've been using for years and dont plan on ever going to another journal app. This one has seen me thru at least 3 different phones and I've never lost a thing! As a writer, I value my writing greatly... I trust this app. Thank you to the creators! I appreciate you! Edit: 06/2023 still here and still loving the app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Put a price tag on it to begin with. $49.99!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very poor customer experience through their chat system. Rude and lack of understanding. The app itself is okay but the subscription system is purposefully confusing, and therefore predatory."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It can't type since I downloaded it anew"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome experience. The app is easy to use and makes journaling fun and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app - able to journal, record things, or back things up on the go! Love that I can just save media as a memory or even jump on the desktop version of the app to write something longer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the latest update. It provides most of the added functionality that I was looking for. Have been a satisfied paying user since 2017."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for a while. Works brilliantly. Premium comes with much more. A digital scrapbook. If you are into Journaling then get this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very exciting and lots of creative options"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I canceled this app 3 years ago. They still build me. I took the matter up with Google Play store and they said they would cancel it. I'm still receiving bills and Chase automatically pays them. I no longer have an account and don't want one. I have no idea how I'm going to stop the Billings from happening."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It great i think its the only thing i can express my self to it freely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Is it just me? Or the app really fails even when you're entering the correct passcode?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I believe I cancelled the first subscription during the 3 day trail but l was still charged for the first year. Apparently l could not claim my money back, and l do not use the app. I can see the enjoyment for people who want to journal but l do not, that's why l cancelled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does everything I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does as it should , i like using it the free version i aint used the free trial yet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this for more than 7 years now and it is so great!! I bought the lifetime subscription and a phone and windows app and it makes journaling so much easier. Way with the cost when considering all the paper journaling I've purchased and only put a few entries in. Journey enables me to easily go through my photos every once in a while and make entries or do small entries as I go! Just an excellent journaling option!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Come on now, you make basic utility like strike, superscript and subscript behind a paywall? Even my default note taking app have more text editing feature than this app. Edit: Wow really? An app that's primary purpose to write things down have such limited feature in writing, and to compensate that you add a rather unnecessary feature like map and calendar? Every note has their date automatically assigned and what makes you think that adding some maps is better than polishing your text?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought a lifetime membership and started journaling with premium. It was a great experience and I liked knowing my details are uploaded to the cloud. But when I changed my phone and logged into journey months later, it turned out that journey didn't save my entries at all. I didn't save my receipt so they refused to honor the lifetime membership (they are a digital company so they must have records). I would not recommend relying on them for your personal journaling and records."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When I changed the device, I lost everything I wrote, and nothing comes back after re-logging in, even though I was constantly syncing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad 😔 😔"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app very regularly to journal my thoughts about many different things in life it's great highly recommended Love the map feature where I can see where I wrote notes that was the major reason I signed up for it and it's been great and has continued to be great over the years hopefully they keep it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"As time goes on developers can't resist the temptation to tinker with things and make their apps more complicated and less user friendly. I chose this app a few years ago because it suited my needs very well. Now I don't like it so much, but it is still very useful way of recording ones daily doings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall it's ok. But there are small issues that are irritating in the long run. For example the delay between opening a note and loading the text inside of it. Or constant reminder to upgrade the version. Yeah, I get, that's how you make money. But come on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lost a lot of entries. Realized it's not as reliable as other diary apps. I've been using this since 2015! Glad I didn't go premium.. Used to love this app, but now I'm very disappointed. Update: I always sync my entries, but still lost some of them. Many good features, but I guess I won't use this again. Also, premium version was waaay cheaper than I used to know, but now it's too pricey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought a lifetime membership for years back. And suddenly, it auto charged me yesterday, which till now, I couldn't check the subscription nor the expiry. It is terrilble experience, and I felt being pissed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good design and easy to use app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for taking note."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great format!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decent way to keep notes. Passcode protected for added security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Some times when i delete the app and download it again i find that some photos and videos have been deleted but my journey on it doesn't disappear, this is a problem for me because i don't have these photos and videos on my device any more and it was very important to me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app can't complain easy to use not to many ads and I enjoy it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for years. You can tag to help with searching. Great for travelogging. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved the app and been a subscriber for a year or so I think? The most beautiful diary-esque place to write your thoughts on Google right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the app since 2015! 💛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The most restricted ""free"" app I've ever seen. Anything other than basic features like backup wants your money. App is constantly nagging you every day. I think you can find better similar apps for free. Considering apple is launching it's free Journal app I think this is pretty much dead in iOS too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Afful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used this for years but recently there's a bug that is annoying me a lot. I usually write my journal at keep or another place just in case the internet dies. Then I usually copy and paste over. But now when I try to copy and paste over, it doesn't paste. I am using an Android with Samsung. Please help fix. Yes I am using clipboard. Just copy on my Android. Then paste into journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Simple and great way to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"For years it was - when starting to edit a note, writing would start at the top, but since last update, they changed it, now it starts at the bottom... I had my whole ecosystem of notes, set up where editing starts at the top. Now it's all wrong, and I can't change this in the settings. This ""improvement"" was just forced onto us - customers! Otherwise - an amazing system, been a customer for years, but lately it seems they are changing from caring about customers, into something else..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice minimalist app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Unbelievably excellent app for writing your memories: it's especially good when you write them by the microphone. So you can just talk on this app rights the text for you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to record your feelings, thoughts and events you have experienced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great ap, and it's accessible from multiple devices, so I can use it anytime I want to write my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not that easy to use. Very frustrating that I cant find a way to export my journal data to my new tablet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I so much love this app. Makes journaling so easy and fun to do. I deeply appreciate the template feature; and that they are free?! I couldn't be happier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Traditional diary can be read by anyone but you can lock this and keep your writings private. It's simple and easy to use and helps me write down my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can you add music option like if you write 🎧 or 🎵and write the song name you are listening to then it will become bold or something? But please make it free. And overall it's good. I've been using this app for 5+ years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome 😎, I now keep tabs on myself using the video, location, moods."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Ive been using this app for years and the free version is good for just jotting down your day. My only complaint is that the actual app messes with my keyboard where it will start deleting letters from the word I'm typing and the letters I'm using are nowhere near the delete button; creating major typos and loss of thought train. Its very annoying and ive considered finding other apps to use but I dont want to lose previous entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They are crooks. They automatically put you on autorenewal, and it's impossible to reverse it. They essentially have no customer service. They say they have Chat, but it takes forever for someone to answer periodically during a chat. They say to discontinue auto-renew, go to ""account Settings,"" for which they provide a false link. Now, they also make it impossible to locate how to cancel, even if I lose money I have already paid"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All good. Quick and easy to document things I need to write down that's lingering in my head from day to day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it so much. Helpful. Plan for. Premium purchase"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This does everything for you. Almost. You just have to write in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Send online need more fix online try 4x send online"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey, Lifetime Subscription. That says a lot. I am now a daily journaler. I have a routine and it fits my style. Never have any glitches or issues. I have used some Coaches, some extra templates too. There is a lot. I really like the recap from 1 month, 1,2,3 years ago today. I always take a selfie so I have a daily photo, I track my mood and health. I use it to document events, feelings, victories and defeats in my daily living. Keep the application as you have. 👍🤔"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too many paywall features, but no sudden ads pop up out of nowhere, so far it's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy the app. Though I don't write everyday, but it's always there when I needed to write or to read what I've written. Can also attach images, doing search..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really getting benefit out of this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! They just added custom templates which was my number 1 requested feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Good app. I bought life time premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love I can write my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for quite sometime now and it's amazing. Simple & easy 👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No intrusive notifications. I'm using the free version and I'm satisfied with it. I write down my thoughts when I feel overwhelmed and the app does it's job to store them with the dates. There are other options to add as well like mood, place and etc. but I find them unnecessary. In summary: a great simplistic app to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's perfect, but 1 thing I don't like about the app is that only those who purchase can get all the benefits and greats in the app, but it's really good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am so upset. I have been using this app for quite awhile. Well, after two years of using it I changed phones and all my information got lost because the app never backed up my info... Which really sucks. I also tried to change my backup account to the one I have more storage and it won't let me. So, yeah, I lost the information of one whole year. And I paid $50 for this thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All platforms sync. That alone is the best thing ever. Because I have it on my ipad and Samsung ultra 🤩 I just wanted one app for all of my main memories. That's the one people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very sneaky way of getting you to use this app. This was listed as a free to use app, but in reality it is a subscription of about £47 a year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a few yrs to log some important information that I can refer back to it if needed. This has been a great experience. The talk to text feature works perfect. You can upload pictures with ease. I did experience issues when I got a new phone. Once I signed in on my new phone some of the entries were missing. Thankfully I compared before I reset my old phone. But other than that, I haven't had any other issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very reliable and consistently updated journal app. Well worth the in app upgrade I paid a few years back. They don't pester me to keep purchasing things or show many ads at all. I like the online feature to be able to view on multiple devices. I do wish there was an easier way to export these, I use some entries for my doctor and the copy/paste method is a bit tedious."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app to keep your daily thoughts. Easly navigate back to any previous day. Search for a particular information of a part day. Overall excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"There is a bug when you hit edit that sometimes the wrong entry is edited. Also the save button on the left side is annoyingly non-android, I always have to hunt for it, and it disrupts the UX. It should be on the right side, with a close on the left. Delete on the right is almost never used, yet it's in the prominent position."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love everything about this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app i like very much. still great app 2023"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My only complaint is that it takes up so much space on my phone. I wish it could function like Google photos and keep the old entries only on the cloud instead of my device. Maybe they'll do an update that does that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm trying several different journaling apps to see what suits me best and I'm absolutely prepared to pay fairly for what I end up going with. It felt sleazy though when Journey prompted me with a one time ""50% off offer"" on an annual subscription and then put a ONE MINUTE timer at the top of the page, and then told me if I exited the page, I'd lose the offer forever. I had no time to even check my finances. This kind of sales tactic is tantamount to bullying and was a major turn-off."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Impossible to cancel this app. Their support chat is unresponsive, their instructions for cancelling do not work. They refuse to cancel the service so you'll have to work with your credit card company to dispute the bill. Developer responded but the instructions DO NOT WORK. And support is never available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy with this app and I've been using it for a long time The one thing that I don't like is on my iPad it shuts down the speaking voice inputting after about 20 seconds but it continues to work perfectly on my Android phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for typing down journal entries and for daily calendar photos. It's also very cross platform friendly. I do wish we could use our own in-phone fonts though instead of strictly what's built in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great! Although it can be slow in terms of reacting to your taps. Maybe it would be better if, whenever you switch out and back of the app, you would have to re-enter the password? I think it seems safer that way. Would be better if the paid features were available for everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been a user for 8 years. If I re install the app or open it on new device, dozen of my entries will load & sync will takes FOREVER and cannot be minimized, or failed *can imagine how much of 8 years diary entries to load? 🙃 Means, not a good idea to reinstall / open the app on new device if you have million entries. Been report this problem but they just like ""nothing can do about it but to wait"". Also, some photo of my past entries is gone. Already reported about this, but no answer yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Usefull app for daily use. New design is excellent. Expecting new features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only journal I've ever used consistently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Memory aid for answering that question "" What the heck did I do last week?"". 5/2023: I absolutely love this app. Great to search back in time for events, people or places. E.g. If you make notes you can check what you liked or didn't at a restaurant you previously ate at. Use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recently got a new phone. I am unable to sign into Journey. I do not wish to sign in with my google account. How do i log in?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over 3 years and I absolutely love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Account... Disappeared? Acquired this app back in 2015 or so; purchased the lifetime membership. Noticed quite recently I was unable to sync to the cloud; checked to see that my old Journey username disappeared and was replaced with just ""User- premium"". Im still writing entries, but terrified I will loose years of entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used Journey on and off in the past and now I decided to keep it as no other application can surpass what Journey has . I know there is a monthly subscription option but Where is it? I am using android phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App reviews are concerning!! I'm getting ready to hit the go button on purchasing the app for a year at a now 49% discount when it was 50%. I'm reading the reviews again because i have trust issues with on Google Play store! I am really conflicted! Is there some type of forum for debates about apps on Google Play store? The advertisement sounds really good but will it hold up? Is the question? I really need there to be a way so I can get more clarity before I purchase this app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app to journal for many years...it got me through the Pandemic. I love the new templates!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for keeping your thoughts, ideas, or if you just need to vent. You have the option to buy more features, but the free version is fine. It is also great to use as a memory keeper, or milestones for your kids. Adding to my previous rating, the remodel of this app is amazing. The templates and coach section are very helpful and just what I personally could use. Being completely honest though if there wasn't a 50% off deal I would not have purchased the membership, it's a little to pricey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"So I had this app for some years now, and I had alot of my notes and diary entries written in this app. One day though the app got deleted while i was cleaning the storage. I install the app again, and all my data is gone. Is there a way I can get my diary back?? Like if there is no way to restore my data, then what is the purpose of Journaling down in this app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've used this journal for years. I took a break and came back only to discover I'd have to pay for premium to see my past journal entries. So they're basically holding my thoughts and messages ransom. I'd rather use a pen and paper. That's morally wrong but most businesses aren't in it for ethical reasons. I wouldn't recommend unless you want to pay to access your thoughts. Ridiculous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, it belps me write down and keep my feelings in contr, i felt."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Omg So slefish. Why I have to upgrade to the premium version to be able to export my data? Am I a prison to the app? All I wanted to do was reset my phone to factory settings then install the app again and import my data back. What a shame to be blocked with a pay wall for the most important option in an app which is always free in every app, except yours. Dear devs, please reconsider this. I loved the app but the lack of this feature makes me paranoid about loosing my data.Ps: skeptic for cloud"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is great! One star (zero star) for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"User friendly and safe app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No Refunds. What was advertised and what is provided is not the same. I tried to get a refund within 20 minutes of my purchase, but they don't allow refunds for ""accidental"" purchases. I put accidental in quotations, because I wasn't sold what was advertised. Avoid this company."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Mindfulness unveiled,....unparalleled with more features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Eh. Not paying for a full year after just 3 days to try. No thank you. I have moodflow already."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it's messed up you didn't let the former free users download their past entries before making it a paid site. i had info on there since 2015 and now it is all gone and i don't have money to subscribe. You should've kept a free version with minimal access to features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been use this app since 2014. And in 2023 here, I have some problem since the UI has changed. Some pic of my entries is gone, so when I read my entries, I didn't understand what happened that day since the photo is gone. I'm afraid this bug will still happen in the future. I'm one of old user for this app, so I hope my review will be heard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my app of choice to record all my moments. It's very handy as my memory is not that good. After years of registering everything on it, it's comforting to get the notifications about how was your current day one, two, three years ago. 👌🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"WHERE DID THE DAILY PROMPTS GO???? SO SADDD"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for a over a year, I bought a lifetime use when it was the option. But my phone had an issue and had to be wiped and now it asks me to pay a yearly subscription & everything is also gone. Before when I changed phones I still was able to have the same app, same account, all my files, but reinstall from a back up somehow no. Just wrong. I'm not happy. I already paid for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like journey diary journal. Jouney allows us stor audio, photos and even videos. A Great and very thoughtful app. Simple and easy use journey app. best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Whats Not TO Like"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not sure what happened to this app. Two years ago, it used to be absolutely amazing. Now it looks... corporate. It doesn't feel like the comfy place to journal that it used to. I don't know where it went wrong, or how to describe my exact thoughts, but I do know that I don't recommend this app. You're much better looking at an alternative, non-price gouging, non-subscription based app. I'd seriously recommend Google Docs and a Google Drive folder over... whatever this turned into."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very limited free features. If you want to stop using know that it is impossible to delete your account. They will keep your data forever. DO NOT USE this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only if you pay you can actually save your entries to your account, otherwise when you get a new phone all your entries are lost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Best for journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💜❤️💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"the app supposed to be good, but most of the feature tabs must be paid, which is too greedy! nah *unstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome theme update! But please add an OLED Black theme and custom colors (so I can set it to bright red)! | I'm extremely thankful for Journey, it helps me keep track of significant things God is doing in my life and reminds me to be hopeful about what's going to happen in the future!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I haven't started using this app buy from what others say it must be Savage"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"**EDIT* - See the developer’s generic response below my review. That is the only response you will get as you try to recover your stolen funds. Save trouble and buy from a company with integrity. * This app is OK, but they will double charge. I bought the lifetime membership, then they billed my card for another annual fee. I tried to get a refund for weeks. After I finally contacted someone who said they would look into it, they went dark. Cutting my losses and writing it off as stolen funds."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just want to cancel my subscription. This is ridiculous! I will write a review. I've tried to unsubscribe in the app store and there is nowhere I can find to do that. Do you think I didn't try that before I wrote this review? I'm requesting that you please just cancel this subscription! I will write another review in 2 days if this is not canceled. Again, absolutely ridiculous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled previous version and attempted to install this one. OPEN on Google Play brings the opening pages and to set passcode. It goes no further. Searching device shows no installation. (preferred the passcode setup with letters & numbers) The old version was good and sorry to lose it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just found this and in the first 10 minutes I love it. Very easy and very appealing to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The new themes and UI are really ugly. I want a plain white background and it's no longer an option. The text preview and image thumbnail have been made worse too. The addition of new templates to use is positive, but with the horrible UI design and forced coloured themes I just don't want to use the app! Please change it back to the previous design."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"In 2018 I left this review: ""I adore this app. I have the premium version and use it on my phone, tablet, and computer. I love that it syncs across devices easily, strips away distracting formatting, is taggable (the best!), and is easily backed up. Thank you for the best productivity app EVER!"" I purchased Lifetime Premium membership 09/03/2016 BUT NOW after a reinstall it will not restore my purchase! Even after following all the instructions on Mac and Android. HELP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I U mm mm uni Is Ann Ann b"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using the app for years now, and it's a really great tool for quick, on the fly Journaling. Tagging locations on to every entry and seeing everything on a map is definitely my favorite feature of all. I will say I have some grievances with some aspects of the app. I very much wish I could add photos on to video entries, instead of needing to make two seperate entries for both, and I miss having a custom background ever since the update. Overall, very good Journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"... dont install if you have a chromebook... (glitchy) (bad quality) (wont let you do anything because you need to pay)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The scrolling in the app is very sluggish."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't write anything on the Wear OS app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The wear os app is almost useless. It should let you record audio or something. All it does it let your read previous entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, although ,I do wish it would stop pestering me about a subscription every time I launch it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This last update was awful. They fell into the Google whiteness hole and now instead of being able to have a bright, happy background I'm forced into this bland, boring pastel world. The wallpaper no longer works so I can't even use that to add some color to this app. The three star rating is because other than suddenly becoming boring this app has a lot of great features but it can become VERY expensive very quickly and features are split up over sooo many purchases."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"hotpepper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I really liked the app, but the recent update removed searching through tags. Now I have to scroll through my hundreds of tags to find the one I want. Please fix it and I will fix my rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"More sophisticated UI compared to other journaling apps but it does NOT support heic image"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is a money pit! I bought a premium lifetime subscription a couple of years ago but then had to buy an annual subscription to unlock the features I wanted. I have upgraded from an android tablet to a Surface Go and now need to pay $19.99 for it on Windows. Every time I try to use the full features as advertised, I am hit with another large cost. It is a great app but I am reluctant to use it further as they will find another way to charge me extra. An absolute con!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Recent update is bad. New UI design is poor"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for many years and have loved it but they have decided to change the entire format with this last update and it is a nightmare to get around and looks awful. I will be looking for a replacement app. Edit: Maybe it wasn't the very latest update; I'm talking about the brand new format that has been implemented. The diary entries have no borders between days so it is hard to see which day is which, each entry doesn't stand out like it did on the old platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After purchasing a premium subscription comes that bad updates to me!! It is very laggy to my mobile, and the sync loading every time I open the app which distract me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful thank you for giving this beautiful app and you have a beautiful achievements beautiful success all the best and the app is very user friendly and very smooth"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary application ever. Period."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for a long time and love it. However after the most recent update, it's almost unusable. My stories do not load, and when i open a journal to read it, when i scroll down the entire screen turns black."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have paid for the subscription but I can't use it. It says that I need to upgrade from free to premium even I have proof that I already paid for 1 year subscription. I have tried to contact their service but I didn't get any response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It should provide a option to sign in using email it phone no. Option to backup journal entries to Dropbox."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The latest design revamp with Material design 3 is excellent! Motivates me to come into the app and log everyday events! Thanks a ton to the design team! Fantabulous UI revamp! MUST TRY FOR JOURNALING FOLKS!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Five stars for the app, three stars for the horrible synchronization between devices. Customer service is pretty much zero. When they do answer they're nice but then you don't hear from them again for a long time and it's just so difficult to get any information, it's usually just cut and paste answers. But the app itself is very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The new update is awful. The previous layout was great. Now it's just ugly with no wallpaper and somehow a narrower colour scheme range. At least give people the option of using the old layout. Or the ability to create their own colour schemes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Give us back the old version the new one is so glitchy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"There is no text spell check. So, since I type on my phone, I make a lot of typos, and they are not obvious and easy to correct."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good for me that's why I give four stars for this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally there is an UI update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, many feature and options. Wish i had time and money to buy full version and go on Hollidays"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have to get used to the new UI in the latest update but it looks fine. The only issue that I'm coming across is that the wallpapers are not working anymore since the update. You can select the wallpaper in the options but the wallpaper is not displayed on the main screen like it used to be. It's just a blank background now even with a wallpaper selected. I also miss seeing my stars on my starred posts from the home screen instead of having to filter them in the search bar."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I don't know why Jou- rney is suddenly putt- ing hyphens in my wo- rds instead of wrappi- ng them the normal way but it is really annoyin- g."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Update took away true black/dark theme. In addition, it does not work very well on my tablet. I purchased this years ago and was very happy with it. Now I will uninstall and roll back to previous version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The new update they did looks and feel so good. I love their app. It has helped me journal and keep tabs on my feelings. For me, it has been a real life saver when I feel I don't have anyone to talk to. Thank you for this wonderful app. I would give it 10 Stars if I could."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stuck on a blue screen with white images on?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app has one of those third-party payment mechanisms which catch you out on the second year by sending you a subscription invoice after they've renewed for another year, rather than in advance so you can cancel if you want to. Pretty poor experience for an app designed to support people's mental well-being."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can add photos, hashtags, & location. I love it! Hey Journey! You should add the option for music to each journal post in the app! It would be cool to integrate giphy to express how we're feeling in each blog post. I like that I have an unlimited amount of characters in each journal entry. It is great that I can add more than 1 photo to each entry as well. I love the new UI!! I love the new look! I've had this app since 2018 & it looks SOOO much better, now! Congrats on the upgrade!! ✨⚡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They updated the app and I lost a year of entries! ☹️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For what it is, it does it well. It's a journaling app. Allows you to attach time, location, pictures, mood. These are the free features. It also offers self-growth courses that I feel are very relevant for people who Journal. Honestly no complaints."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am giving them 3 stars for their app-related support, which is terribly poor! Most of the times they do not even understand the question that you are asking, and point you instead to some written that you might have read a 100-times already before reaching out to them. Their Premium tag from your account and sync vanishes write frequently. Recently I lost three months worth of data due to their syncing issues, and literally got no support from them!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good journaling app. 2023 Have been journaling since my first review and still going strong. Bought a blue tooth keyboard for just this purpose. Helps with all the stuff going on to get your thoughts out. This app has a very simple interface but to me it contains everything I need to get stuff out of my head. Thank you for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years to keep all my memories both on my phone and in the cloud. What fascinates me is how they continually update their apps, and I must say I love the new design update of the Android app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I feel i had a companion with my journey😊😇"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi in the recent update ' open the map ' missing for previous entries. Why???? Hi.. thank u for bringing back the open map. U deserve 5 stars from me. Tq"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"♥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it to track my health issues and my eating habits.. and exercise it's a.great tool to see what is working for me the best ..I would recommend this app ..I have not.used the enhancements because I don't need them..I like that you can add photos to your daily entry..up to two I think it is"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app - great support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Ugh. The new tag selection screen is way worse than it was. It's hard to find the right tags when searching by typing. It throws any weird with the letters up there when it should prefer words that start with what I'm typing. When I choose one it doesn't clear the entry field automatically so I have to clear it manually. When I have more than four tags I can't see the search results, either. Revert!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Now I remembered why I uninstalled the app. It keeps asking me to pay! Guess free has its disadvantages. But it's a good app. Just the ads gets annoying like a bug! So I either pay or get annoyed all the time. Or use something else before I journal too much. No, I am not enjoying This Journey! Put that there are ads when you don't pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't bother. Gives a 3 day free trial and then slaps you with a $45/year subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I am able to take any thought, reading, and/ or image and j Kendall it, without any complications!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice. It's not flooded with ads and I'm using it for free so far. No regrets downloading it at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but they make it really hard to cancel the subscription. I've tried a few different ways and even customer service and I cannot cancel my sub! It's crazy! I'll have to cancel my CC I guess"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is good because it helps my mind and easy to use. I'll recommend it to my friends."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal out there & after seven years I'm still loving this app. The new update is brilliant and loving the look of it. Thank you very much for your good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Update kinda sucks. Why change it? My text/sentences are overlapping each other in each entry. The developers got rid of true black/dark theme. Why would you remove this option? Latest Android supports dark theme especially Samsung. I think i will uninstall and go back to the previous version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The new UI is childish and a degrade in user experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this application for several years now and I like the password option to keep my thought secret. I have recommended the application to others as I believe in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Nice Update Bro... Usefull thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Having issues with the app not syncing though all my devices. There also appears to be an update but it won't install. Took a bit of effort but in the end managed to get the issues sorted out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is really good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I used to like the app. Was able to write down some memories about my 1st and only pregnancy but after not using it for some time and the updates, my entries were all lost. Should have stuck with old-school handwritten journals. :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A good journal app with a fair amount of features. Solid, no crashes. Things I wish it had, a drawing function, inline photos, and direct share to social media. One or two of those would make it 5 stars. Still my goto journal without them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!! Allows me to journal and attach pictures to my entries as well..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I journal everything here, the free version is really all you need, great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The latest update has made the interface incredibly clunky. It's much slower too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A note keeping app with free articles that cost you 70$ a year lol Response to dev comment: but you don't charge per month do you? You charge 70$ lump sum per year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for like 7 years ^^"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just perfection.Google drive sync is masterpiece"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I think there should be an effort to prove privacy exists with in the app, such as third party audits. A journal requires the highest degree of privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great 5 years of using."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"REDEe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for couple of years. It's very user-friendly. I love it, it functions as my gratitude journal, and I can jot down any important notes without any add interfering. I can even post through my laptop. With small fees, I can use the cloud storage, so no issue when old phone got damaged. I still can continue with my new phone, with every past entries still intact. 10/10."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been a premium user since 2015. This app has the best UI design out there. Best for writing journals and taking notes. Can include image, location, has word count, tags, etc.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Uber useful app. Pretty soon you will get to rely on it for almost everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good way to vent about all my anger and stress and issues"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app to capture moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good. Simple feature. I could write what's on my mind safely. Add pic or video easily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the reminders. I record my dreams in it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for more than 3 years now but it's disappointing that I'm unable to get back my previous journal entries despite backing up my account. Any way you guys can help?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very accessible and friendly app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Haven't used app In a long time and can't find my backup of previous entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Friendly UI with enough features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good ap with some nice features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Asalaam Aliakum- I Love the 'free' version of the app, & I love the paid subscription of the app too! Having different colors to write with, different back ground colors, & the Journal Coach is awesome too. The prompts for topics to journal on are awesome too! Thank u for all your efforts, ur help, ur free version of the app & know that U R loved forever X's infinity AND E=Mc2 but our Almighty Lord loves u all even more then that though! Asalaam ✌️ peace Loving you all!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am in my ninth year of using Journey for my daily journal entries and pay for the premium edition. I use it on my Chromebook, but it syncs with my phone so I can write or edit entries on my phone too. I enjoy the daily notification about my past entries and taking a trip down memory lane. There are fewer editing tools than a word processing app and it has glitches when I use it in expanded mode on my Chromebook. I recently found that using tablet mode on my Chromebook works better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Looks and feels great. It backs up and syncs your entries across multiple devices through Google. Evernote is cumbersome. This one is the best in its category. Premium plan allows multiple upload of photos. Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't believe how many years I've used Journey already. Thank goodness it has stayed so updated and functional, but another aspect I like about the project is that my posts are actually stored on my own Google Drive, so if I ever needed to move to something else if this shut down, I'd at least have that file to start from. Honestly, just the practice of typing my thoughts and goals is good therapy, even if I never look at them again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app because you can back up your files and it's very convenient for me. I stop using this app like a year ago, then I started to install this again and I can't believe that all my journal entries for the past few years are still here in Journey App. It is also easy to use but this requires data if you're using this app outside journaling. Overall I like this app. I just haven't use yet their premium version but it's still good for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Would be great if I could handwrite with stylus though ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Literally my favorite app on my phone due to I know I can come back an it will always be here"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bombared by multiple premium sign up ads before you can try it out. UPDATE: Hello, Developer. Thanks for your reply. Begin 3 day trial - that's the screen I saw. Maybe there was a tiny X to close it that I missed? Anyway, the fact that it will not present in landscape is deal breaker for me. All the best to you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Cannot access old entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like so much the fact that it's linked with Google account, so I can sign in and use this app even if I used another device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been amazing to be able to journal anytime anywhere across platforms. You never know when you will need to journal something deep that you are feeling in the moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Forcing ads on me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app. I would like them to give a writing option with a stylus"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Longest Diary I've kept. Simple features and easy to use. Syncs wonderfully w/o glitches ** It's 2023 and these guys still have my support. I've transferred from phone to phone seamlessly and the sync is still that easy! They've added some really cool features over the years but for people like me that want a nice simple app for journaling with a simple interface, reminders etc this is my go to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary/journalising app I've ever used, the feature that I loved the most the most of the diary apps there has the automatic cloud sync function which helps me write from my phone to tablet and etc. Best ones I've ever used so far (for free) Update :I noticed that for some reason there is a bug where some parts of my entries disappear so a backup function may be useful at this moment..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Usable while free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like it but there are entries that just disappear and cannot be retrieve. After writing a long entry, it will be gone soon as i save it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish I had had this App when i was younger. The memories I would have with me now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal for my daily needs, been using it for a few years now and nice to be able to look back on past events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app. Love that there's no ads on the free version. Been using it for Years now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, and the interface is organized, aesthetic and clean. I've been using it regularly for 7 years now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for documentation!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app having purchased a Premium account years ago. Forgot about it till reminded today. Loved it to journal a Euro tour. Interface greatly improved over my 5 year hiatus. Keep it up. Plan to journal some of my current life issues gong forward."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fine but should be free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app but I lost all my entries when my phone broke and that really sucks. This happened one other time and I was able to retrieve it all with my email and password. Idk that I would get the log in info right this time but I couldn't even find an option to log into an account. Is this a feature that's been removed?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I found this app very useful after using it for a few years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy with the app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App, has all the features I need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm looking for a way to delete my account but it doesn't seem possible. Used it for a bit but it seemed very gratitude focused which I didn't want. Can someone contact me to help delete my account?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"IT IS A SCAM. During the lockdowns, in July 2020, they made some promo that you could upgrade for a lifetime premium membership for less money than usual. I paid for the subscription but didn't really use it much until now, 2023, only to discover they cancelled my subscription for no apparent reason. I sent the receipt to a person called John and am trying to reach someone on they costumer assistance, but nobody is ever available. Deeply regret the decision."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"STRAIGHT AWAY ASKING FOR PAYMENT UNISTALLED"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journeying app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Still using and enjoying. I was able to backup a copy when I changed phones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be better if there was a lifetime membership option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Annoying tips and hints, forcing payment asap however i don't know if i like the app yet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really like this app. It's easy to use. Occasionally if you aren't on the newest operating system and app version it does have problems with typing, but I love that it has password protection, a simple UI and cloud back up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"too many pay walls"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app, been using for years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the app. Works well now..for a while data was getting lost on the backup but it now seems to be ok with the software updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this app since 2014 until now, and this is my first review about it. My only problem is, some photo of my 5 years ago entries are GONE! When I re-read it, I had no idea what I wrote about, because the photo is dissappear. Not all entries, just like 6 or 7 entries. But I'm worry if this bug will happen in the future, so please fix it🙏🏻 But so far, this is my only diary I use to keep many things like notes, checklist, and any other important memories and toughts👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app !! Thanks to the journey team :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"having nothing negative to say. i must concede and give this app the credit it deserves. buy the subscription it's so worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"its best other app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome diary, highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app really saved my life😭🙌 It helped me organize my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Best part is that it's free with lots of awesome features. Everything perfect recorded and organised."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app, wish it accommodated voice notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the Journey App, especially that it can sync with my android and Windows laptop!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my 6th year with Journey. My favorite features are easy platform to use including bullet points, ability to add photos, shareability, and search functions to easily locate a past memory."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app wanted me to upgrade everytime. I tried to sync my entry for 18 months and it didn't happen. Then the whole 18 months data got deleted. Hopeless app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update from Feb. 5, 2023: I found out sync works with Google Drive. Old review: Nice app for the price (free!). Fits my needs for basic writing. I haven't lost data and I can't complain. I would advise backing up content to other apps every once in a little while. I don't quite understand how sync works with this app and where data is saved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I never thought I'd keep a journal, but this app is excellent. My only gripe is that the app keeps force closing and using more battery than it should apparently. I keep being advised to put it into deep sleep - which of course I don't wish to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good first time using this but it looks pretty"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app been using it for years and can see journal entries I wrote In 2018 and track my growth . Highly recommend!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent Application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, it fulfills all my journalling needs, love the throwback feature, LOVE that it syncs with my GDrive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far happy with the app! Would want to explore more of its features and also anticipate probable improvements. Export to word maybe? Or cross post ? Ahhhh lovin the ideA"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"(3 Feb 2023) upgraded from 4 to 5 stars. Been very satisfied using for almost 3 years. Nice layout and user interface. Have on desktop and mobile. Very easy! ~~~Review from 9 Apr 2020~~~ Ready to jot quick journal entries. Nice varsity of options and reminders to add photos to journal and write daily. Think I paid extra for that feature. Also paid, but I haven't figured out how to assure seamless sync between Android app, cloud, and desktop. Good it's possible, but need to read the instructions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Had to reset my phone logged back on. Everything was gone!! Thanks for nothing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far I'm liking the app. I've watched parents and grandparents get older and loose more and more memories. I want to start micro journaling to record and preserve new and old memories to hold on to all my life. I'm hoping this app will enable me to do so without the risk of loosing all that I put into it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very detailed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app that has helped me stay focus and on track while allowing me a space to record my thoughts and clear my mind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Flawless. Makes me journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bugs Bugs and bugs! I was considering getting the paid version of this app and now looking at all the bugs it has, have to seriously reconsider. Text gets automatically deleted while typing, spaces come in automatically."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient way to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Does not give 3 day free trial as advertised... it offered a 3 day trial but when I accepted this, it charged me straight away from today for a whole year at FULL price. It does not allow you to cancel the subscription in the first 3 days on Google play. I had to ask Google Play for a refund! Very bad experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been a nice journey 🙂 since I began using this app. There isn't anything more I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can write journals and schedules in this app! It's very amazing and I recommend you should try it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would say 5 stars but no PEN SUPPORT. Otherwise excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It froze"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, to help reinvent out mental health"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nope. Collects and Shares your personal, private data. Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is very straightforward to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best. So nice. 4 years, premium membership no regrets, thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"These guys charged me without me ever knowing. $48. Plus it looks like they're going to charge me again if I do not cancel. I have not been able to contact anybody and I'm not able to get a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I want to sync with Onedrive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using this app! It has everything I need. A place to journal, put in pics, look up interesting things to read or use like meditations, exercises, coaches, nutrition, and more! I would highly recommend it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Topnotch of a journal experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Love that I can sync and add pics"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Went subscription and I went bye bye. I paid for the app, I don't want to have to keep paying for the app. Moving on"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Customer service has not been responsive in refunding my auto-renewal. I hadn't been notified about this renewal via email and there was no way for me to cancel it since I didn't purchase it from the Play Store. Please refund my $32.54 charge asap. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I wasn't able to get it to keep indentations for my paragraphs, but after a few journal entries, it seemed like a good journal app to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works as expected"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for a long time and have loved it, but recently the app has begun malfunctioning when I type. On both my phone and tablet, I will be writing an entry and suddenly parts or all of my entry disappear as I'm writing, and there is no way to get them back. They are just gone. I have installed the latest version of the app, but the bug still exists. At the moment I can't use the app because I can't trust it to work properly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Doesn't go past setting the passcode"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Overcharged my annual subscription UNAUTHORIZED!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"رائع"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best diary apps I've ever used, I only look for the one that saves on cloud automatically since I have an tablet and a phone, so that feature will be very helpful to me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this journal for years now. I am so happy and satisfied with it. Syncing is great. Changed my device a few times and all my entries are still intact. I love that my entries are compartmentalized with tags. Hope they can now combine videos and photos in one entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good. It keeps your data logged, so if you change devices, you can still access all of your information."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good top level app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for 3 years and I face no problem"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app I've found for journaling! Subscription is worth every bit! Won't be using anything else!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app... especially the paid version. Though it would be nice if it was all free, I think the paid version is worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using the app for almost 3 years and yes, I'm still enjoying it. It's so easy to track back all my previous journals. The only downside is that, I can't see the 'photo memories' as I am to broke to pay for membership. I'm still gratefull for the free features - free journal + 4pics/1video. If you're looking for digital journal, this is the best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey App is so easy to use as your journal of your days. Have years of on this day 3 years ago I wrote... use it as a scrap book, daily devotion, note keeper.. ideas are endless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. I've been using it for years and no regrets"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using the Journey app since 2016 and still going strong!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good aps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the format and the features. If it wasn't so expensive, I would consider the cross device feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years and really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app use it everyday on multiple devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always enjoyed looking back on previous entries and the UI is simplistic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for five years now and I am really satisfied. It easy when switching phones because everything is saved in the cloud, and even though I have an app license (old one, don't think they have it anymore) I can still access my entries on the desktop. Love the UI 💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty alright app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It used to be a lot better, I wouldn't have spent money on it if I had known they would remove the stat page in favor of the whole coaching portion there instead. The ability to visually track stuff was a big portion of why I bought premium to kinda thank them on making a good app. Like I still may use it some only because it has years of old journal entries, but I really miss that feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App locks randomly and I lose the entry I'm working on. I'll just keep using the web browser version, even though it lacks many features the app has."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has more features than I use, but it is nice to know they are there. It doesn't make you follow any rules but gives you lots of personalized opportunities. I love that there are no cutesy icons or characters. Some of the coaching prompts are limiting but they keep you on path. I wish the widget was more inviting. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has helped open my world through freedom of using this app anytime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for some years now. Excellent, but I find it difficult to use on Chromebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it since 2016 and I finally bought the subscription. Been my best friend when no one has been around to listen. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I would give 5 stars but... I got new phone and my paid membership was gone, also my entries. I haven't gotten any results from journey. At this point I want refund"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal app. It provides the right amount of encouragement and support to keep writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app because I can voice talk into my phone for entries or I can type them into my computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Satisfied with the app. Thank you. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Once I moved to Android I couldn't use Day one. This has been the best app for my jounaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Well at 44$ + tax US 💵 a year @ that price keeping my thoughts & O.P. to myself. Or just find another free diary app🤷🏼‍♀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"- 60k/month - 410k/year - 1.4m lifetime + Best journal app + Web version / multi platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Good app, unless you want to use it to journal while travelling. Changing timezones messes with the dates and times of the entries and you end up with entries showing in the calendar and time line on a different day than written. Tried to reach out to support about it and was told that was the intended design. Talking to support was like banging your head against a wall of nails. You can't change the order of pictures once uploaded, and the order reverses by itself after syncing on a new device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Inexplicably lost over a years worth of data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It been everything I am looking for I can add pictures and videos and it uploads to the cloud which is great for if I lose my phone. Two thumbs way up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Google did a good job cleaning up my hacked email account and a tech person from journey helped me keep my journey database straight. I went through this online and never found out who helped me. So thank you. I've been using journey since 2014 and it's been a good experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years. I absolutely love the ability to go back and see struggles and growth. Easy to use and I'm enjoying the photo features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Be careful with these scammers! I signed up for free account in 2019 and only found out they've been charging me without my consent. Never even gave them my card information, they must've gotten it from Google store, even though it won't show up under subscriptions and wont receive any invoices/receipts. Stay away from this app at all costs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for around 7 years. So far so great. Membership is too expensive though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it I enjoy use it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this since 2018. Not regularly.. I lost count on how many cp I used but everytime I have a new one I always installed this app. Whether I used it or not. Thanks Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Paid version may be better. Every action in this app is preceeded by a prompt for purchase. Its confusing to separate what features are free. Im about to try to email entries to myself. Cross my fingers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app daily for a few years now. A great find!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy it works on several platforms, good privacy, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Don't really write on a regular basis but that's ok. Simple. Create your own tags and use one or more with your journal. Can use list form by just using a #. Must be having other great features but not a heavy user so.. Recommended.. Am using the free version.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. I love the gentle reminders and the fact that I can see my journey since I've started using this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My go-to app for journaling. Love it for its simplicity. Only gripe is that the text formatting in the editor doesn't show me what the final entry looks like. Edit: the editor has been much improved since my last review. Still my go-to app. Still love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am using the free version and it serves me pretty well. It's simple with no annoying ads except for the nudge to get membership which I don't mind. I can record my thoughts and even backdate entries if I missed a day but would like to have an entry on a specific day. It has never crashed or behaved in any weird way so yeah, I am happy with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for diarists. Make a note everytime something happens and revisit later in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been journal of a few years I use journal like a diary. I recommend Journal it has other good features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I tried to get a refund about 2minutes after installing. Nope. THIEVES"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this since 2017, and it's one of the best. Seameless integration, cloud backup, plus clean and simple layout. Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"They've gone greedy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very friendly and seems to have a way of nudging me to write my experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy way to keep some sort of journal if you're not the journaling type (I've been asked to keep one re my experiences with pain by my doctors and previously found I didn't do it)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been such a good therapy for me to be able to not only write my journey but also have the option of video and so much more. I highly recommend this journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brazy App. Amazing and recommendable if you're into journaling. I myself downloaded the app just for the sake of journaling so I didn't purchase the premium. But if you're planning to, you should. period. boom badaboom bam bam."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All my entries from 2018 are gone I already emailed to your service email but nobody is helping me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent customer service and swift resolution of glitch in syncing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still very useful, simply the best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate and use. Worth the premium purchase 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app as a personal journal. The reminder of your last achievements/events is a nice touch. It does everything I would expect it to do. No complaints from me. I just switched phones and everything transferred over seamlessly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping track of daily stuff or just for logging your activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best... using since 2016!! I've purchased life time members in or around 2017. This app is theee best, no other journal app can beat this app! Pls just keep working on adding new updates & awesome features...Ty!!! Good work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Help me alot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is best app for journal.Do not care what other people say this app is excellent.They do not force subscription or ads which is very good.I really used this aplpfor long period of time and I didnt have any problems."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Takes care of most of a person's needs. I haven't used all of it's features but just the little part that I am using is worth the annual fee!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has always been my favorite Journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"difficult to add to the new day. what seems like the place to journal on the new day puts the person into history Etc. Needing to have on calendar doesn't seem like the obvious place to start writing for a new person. This should be updated so that it's dirt simple and very obvious where to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ETA: 7 years and I still love this app. It is lovely. I use it for daily journaling with text and photos, and I use the tags and text formatting features which all work as they should. Granted I am not a demanding user who wants tons of features, I just wanted something basic that WORKED. This does! I can also write/edit on my laptop, though that interface isn't as pleasant and sometimes the text formatting between the two is odd."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I pay for theowback entey, but app say no deletet entry today !!!! Bad app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective 10 from 10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You can't logout from your account that easily from this app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of my favorite apps. It makes it easy for me to keep my journal every day and to remember to set aside a couple nice photos instead of go through them all at once. It's so beautifully designed and it works so well. They don't introduce unnecessary changes. They seem to focus on making sure that the things it's supposed to do work really really good! It has this feeling of being designed right the first time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good Journaling app. It does what I expect it to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it's not letting me Write anything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very helpful, it allows me to go back and view the growth and the thoughts that I have had, the things that have happened in my life and with premium, I can access it anywhere, chromebook, PC, or on my phone. Coaching allows me to have prompts for journaling when I am stuck"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I transferred from another app. Thought I wouldn't like it but I did! It's easy to use and interface is clean and pretty."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Update - use to be good but now trying to charge half the price of a typical streaming subscription every month - tad overpriced? Old review -Just does what it needs to really well. Perfect when you need to keep a long term log of something that you want to reflect on later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Free trail is subscribe. in these times i subscibe to want is free until i appreciate it and decide to by it. Good business practice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app, but the subscription price is a bit high. It has decent features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wonderfully simple interface, just what I was looking for. If I had a wish list for improvements it would be to add templates to my android version and when I select tags to show me all the tags I already have in a list instead of waiting for me to type first. I would also like to be able to set new tags up independently from any particular entry. But these are minor points really, I love the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good if you don't want to sit down in a notebook and write your thoughts down if you're just ADHD like me and you have something on your mind getting to the journal write it down and you can read about it later but I think that's great too excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app literally helped changed my life. I have something like 1500 entries over the last 3 years. I used to struggle badly with depression. One of the most important tools in fighting depression is gratitude, and this app has allowed me to record & track, throughout the years, the moments in my life that are worth tracking. They make it so easy, it becomes second nature. I've downloaded other gratitude journal apps, but this is the one I've stuck with. Thank you, Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good. But disturb all the time for upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App works well, but $30 every year is simply too much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for many years now. I've found it a great way to store and remind me about all aspects of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have written a lot of entries this year but at some point your app was being very glitchy, so I decided uninstall and install again and when I went to sync my entries for some reason ALLLL of my entries this year were deleted, is there any I can bring them back? I had a lot of Important things written down😭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm not a good journalist... in fact I downloaded this app to see if I could start a new habit..it has not been easy. But that has nothing to do with the app. This app will help you get started Journaling with out the pains of what to say or convoluted hidden features. It's been 10 weeks since I started and I've nothing negative about it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Needs a legacy feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I synchronised all my entries to cloud and then reinstalled the app i lost half of my entries.... Its showing synchronizing symnol.... And stucked for last 40 mins... Will it synchronise?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"To provide some constructive criticism per the request of the developer, I didn't enjoy the layout of photos. I wish that it would allow you to add multiple photos to an entry rather than keeping them in a gallery for that entry. This way you can really recreate and preserve the moment without the need to caption an image in an entries gallery. Basically blog style, say a few things, add a picture, say more another picture. Really helps with reliving the moment when reviewing it later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to make entries. I find this is important for a journal app. Intuitive operation for making quick entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Meeting expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quality journaling app - I appreciate the fast, clean and easy interface. Easy to find something in looking for in past entries, or just jump in and write something quickly. The free tier allows text and photo/file attachments which is what I'm looking for, and they have regular sales if you want more than that. Upgrade ads are very reasonable, not intrusive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is the journal ofy apprenticeship. It's giving me all options I could wish to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You can add more modes for use, ex: sleep, work, watch tv, walk, cinema, e.t....two years later still doesnt update my suggestion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the app! It's a lot easier than hand writing every day! The daily tags are good for searching through different entries. It'd be nice to have a calendar showing the daily moods as well :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I bought the app, but the app has a few short comings I consider serious: 1. It does NOT let you do bolding, italic or underline nor does it let you change font size. 2. It does not let you creat multiple journals, for example, ine for work and one for personal thought..etc My old app from PocketPC dayswas able to do that but this app cannot, something is wrong there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been there for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app I use it daily and it's gotten better over time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app and works perfectly on my new phone. Have upgraded to the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect app for journalling, been using it every day and no big problems so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A moving diary ☺️☺️☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for daily journaling. It would be nicer if the developer add a drawing pad into the app so that ideas can be illustrated more easily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years! Slight annoyance when they contstantly ask you to subscribe but it's nothing compared to the benefits you get from journalizing. When I start having a job, I'll subscribe for sure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app intuitive, lots of options to add content to entries, lots of settings so you can customize it. No crashes, etc. Has cloud backup and can be used on a computer too. Great app. Update 2 years later: still a great app!! Easy to tag entries and easy to make posts more thorough with images, location, weather- everything! I highly recommend app to use as a way to document your kids growing up, funny things pets or kids do, or just to vent into the void to get some feelings out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for journals. But sometimes I find the popping ads annoying. Nonetheless, everything is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Bought the full version. Only gripe is when you're in a different timezone it moves your post depending on what timezone you're in so it becomes a mess"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app makes me realized paying for software is not worth it. Long live piracy !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it since 2016"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy journaling my daily activities and thoughts. Very straightforward app and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had an issue with syncing but it was on my end. My drive account was full. I've been using this app for years and lo e it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity of this app for my journaling. I especially like the ability to add pictures, locations and more to my journal entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very efficient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and clean styling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having on all my units"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After trying several, this is my go-to app. Works well, no issues, solid performer over time. Would definitely buy again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ages past"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great functionality and ui. Edit in 2022 - it keeps prompting me to leave a five-star review, even though I already did two years ago which I find super annoying, plus it doesn't allow you to close the prompt. Dropping to four stars because you've been pissing me off and this is a bad day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for about 6 years on my phone. Pics, videos, memories... Got a new phone and lost it all. Reached out for help, someone responded weeks after my initial email, but then just stopped trying to help my recover my years of reflection. I lost everything, and no one was willing to help me get it back. Despite paying for premium membership for multiple years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well, even the free version has sufficient functions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazingly easy to use app, serves it's purpose well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty simple and straight forward app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hands down best notes and journaling app. They take care of their users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been using this since 2018 and love it despite i can use while having no internet connection at all. Just yesterday log in via web and i can see half of year entries are gone. I took ages to sync and always getting error code. Guess its time to wave a goodbye then 🥲"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There is no way to get all your diary entries back after reinstalling the app after a reset. I've lost an year's worth of diary entries. The free version could at least have a function to access the diary entries via drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfect. I have a pin set to unlock it before it's opened which is a must for me to use a journal. I can upload pictures and screenshots to attach to my entries as well which is really useful. It has a handy tag and search function as well. I haven't had any issues with it at all no crashing or not opening or anything else. It's everything I want in a journal and so far it's working perfectly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There are few font options for android. But overall, the app is good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its indeed a great application. I am using this to store my journal almost from last almost six years and i am loving it as it helps to increase awareness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Need better way to edit/change time of entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking my life. Capturing Very important information about my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've switched phones and I'm not finding it easy getting my data at all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish after I read a throwback and push the back button, it takes me to the previous page, NOT the ""homepage"". For the throwback function, I prefer the old layout. Minus one star because of this. I'll change it back to 5 star when it fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I keep all my notes in here. I can also see them online if I'm on my computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had years of photos and videos backed up there and they claim everything thing sincs but they lost all my videos and photos from 2017, when I started it to 2020. Their customer service is NO help at all and just ignored the emails. All of my photos and videos of my kids gone. This app is awful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It would be a really cool app if everything wasn't premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been enjoying this app for several years but I'm switching from a Moto to a pixel and I can't get the cloud connect to work on the old phone. It acts like it's connecting but it's not. So that's very frustrating. I do enjoy the previous entries that pop up. It's interesting to see what I was doing five or six years ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used this app for the free version for a while .. I paid for a year and absolutely love the app and the features and very much plan to buy a lifetime subscription when my year is up .. 2 thumbs up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use interface. I use it occasionally, mainly to keep a record of the activity behind the photos, So the upload function is the most frequently used function. Would hope that the team may try to improve the photo uploads function so that the photos are uploaded in the order I choose, or in the time stamp order. It is quite a hassle when I'm uploading 10 photos at one go to find out that the timeline is mixed up. Uploading one by one is also a hassle."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I want it to, what more can you ask?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app Fresh Enviorment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journey app is a good app and so far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it for a week and a half and am quite happy about this application. Therefore 5 stars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Eazy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not going to pay a monthly subscription for a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"When will this app have a template option? I'm paying premium of this yet Daylio offers their template feature for free? I will wait for this feature to be available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy it. Works good. Lots of adds for the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the free version and that I can use it on my phone and my computer. It does give me an excessive amount of popups telling me to subscribe. I realize this is how apps work and how they make money, and I appreciate that this doesn't have ads, but the pop ups can be a little annoying. If I had the funds to buy this I would, but I can't yet. Nice app for journalling on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional. Thank to this app I have kept writing for 4 months now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried alot of journaling app but this is the only app I stick to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!! It is free rather than comparing to other apps,it has premium paid version but only for more options,but I felt good as other apps wants us to pay for writing more than 500 words but this app doesn't expects us to pay and also and backup to drive option for free,and we can add photos also,such a good app I haven't seen on Play Store,I write everyday as I feel good, and I'm happy, I like this app pls install it and give a try,at first even I didn't understand much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Saigo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I would have rated this app 3 stars, as the functionality is passable, but the customer service was extremely unhelpful, so I'm lowering the rating to 1. There are glitches in the text display and ads to upgrade even in the paid membership version. Customer service was extremely unhelpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Incredible. Just hope this app last forever for me to keep my data forever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this. I've had it for years and find it so fun to write with your in-the-moment photo."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Also, can go back to write on prior dates which is good for creating a timeline"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've enjoyed using this app for years. Recently there was a problem after a system update but it's working great now that the app had an update. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app on the store"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient and well-organized"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it-- I don't feel intimidated if it's only a short entry one day, or a long one another. Links are intuitive, and theres rich text for bold or italics."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Still checking. Always asking premium virsion"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use and helps to tell your story and experiences each day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app I switched from DIARO to this because the format is just so much easier for me to grasp"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I may not be consistent in using frequently, but find it helpful when I do. User friendly, and I appreciate the ability to attach media with entries. A bit expensive for the yearly membership but worth it for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to document everything. Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App is quite beautiful, but very laggy here and there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really loved this app until the most recent update. It keeps adding spaces between paragraphs each time I try to edit. I'm afraid to add anything new because it messes everything up or I just can't find it because the space goes down in such huge amounts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for one's invaluable memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal! Keeps me sane!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great video journal. This was the only app that met my needs for a daily video journal that had cloud backup and didn't put a time limit on the video. Displays a cel dar view of all your video entries which is super nice. Reminders are a good feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Long time user. I had an issue that ended up being with Grammarly keyboard. The customer service response team here with the app was like less than 20 minutes and I got it resolved. A+ app and support!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Перейшов на нього з DayOne за більшу кількість підтримуємих платформ, бо не тільки яблуками багаті."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey! I just recently got back into journaling for my mental health and it's still my top pick!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this since 2019 and it's got a great platform to write down in entries. Simple enough for everyone to use and overall I can look back and see mental improvements."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Prompts me to journal without being annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Organized, beautiful, easy-to-use app with the most appropriate name."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Naisu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is very intuitive and easy to use with many features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After a long google search, Journey was the only app providing all the services I was looking for. Definitely worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I wish you could add more pictures to each post. I'd pay good money for that 😢"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Top app that's all I can say"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can I share my journey with others"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free, requires registration"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to journal and later remind ourselves how far we've come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"My first entry (in 2021) got deleted. Why??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent. It's really helped me to know yourself more ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"after you put all your diary notes in the cloud, they restrict it you from download it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple and straight forward app for personal journal and its without lag or bug, Ive been using it for a week now and I like it a lot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The membership layout is bothering me verymuch, why its located in the bottom of the menubar now. I've been using this app foralmost 7 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app I wish you could add pictures and videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy with the features of this app. Everything is wonderful. It has a clean design and is very nice to look at."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. I absolutely love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like Journey, I even bought the app with premium services. being in a technical virtual world today. With the anxieties weighing on our shoulders in todays world. This self-journal I'm sold on, you've changed my mind. they offer a lot of constructive self helps, which is becoming more of an movement today. Anxieties, mental health issues, and building self-esteem articles and so much more inside this Journey App Self Diary. I think it is amazing even tho I keep forgetting to write in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using journey for around 5 years. I don't journal in the app faithfully. But I think that is part of the magic. I'll drop in an entry and add pictures. So I can do a few at a time: what happened, add pictures, ""do you want to adjust the date?"" Yes! If I write something in my journal that I want to keep, I'll take pictures and attach to an entry. Or even record myself reading the entry I wrote. OMG that is powerful to watch years later! The pop up features are then perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost priceless entries for a whole year and one month period .Zero support for paid member despite various requests over two months. Very curt reply from support telling that entries not synced with Google drive .Very sad state of affairs. Would not recommend this unreliable app for anyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Honestly this is the best journaling app I've used, period."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to record your thoughts and experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps for Journaling. Love it for its simplicity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been a paying member for some time. I forget what level. I know I still get ads but I did pay something. Either way, I enjoy it. I only recently started to make more use of it. Along with paper journals. Features are nice and adding photos to various entries is very nice. It really brings the entry to life. My one complain having found out NOW as of writing. I wish they Chromebook app was built for a laptop. While setting it up as Tablet view is helpful, I prefer full screen option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it to record the funny things my kids say, I always have it at my finger tips, it syncs well with Google, and I can add pics to remember the day. Haven't tried printing anything, but I do love this app. Update, been using this for years, changed phones and everything easily synced. Totally worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. (2016) It's now 2022 and I still love it 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very well made app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Please Add A ""Print Complete Journal"" option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, I can get my thoughts and memories down in a safe place, it's easy to use. Highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Beware in opt in for free trial. I wanted to see if it will be worth for premium /NOT MEMBERSHIP. but the free trial is for membership plan. I cancel the next day. Google emailed the confirmation. But then I was charged 1 year membership. The system might be fraud. Customer service respond like we beg for money, and of course no gesture of refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Has a daily emotion tracker but no feature to be able to see your moods across time, so it's essentially useless. Please add a way to view emotion scores across days/months."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic . A diary on the phone is now a core app like the camera or calender."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All my notes, journal entry for the period 2020 to 2022 vanished from journey app. It's heartbreaking for me to loose such precious thoughts and memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good, please make the ads on the free version less intrusive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Even font color and style is also asking for pro version. I think these minimal features must be free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Almost impossible to get videos out of the app - downloading in the app fails for most videos with a network error, and the data synced to Google Drive is hidden in an app folder. Update: Sharing an entry as zip file and then extracting the locally saved zip file works, but that's a hack, not a solution."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good App with Mysterious Purchase System. I have been using this app for last few years and have purchased it as well which like purchase for lifetime. But now its (the purchase) not appearing at all and asking me to but the premium one. Not sure what's happening."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You will never be able to unsubscribe. STAY AWAY! I installed the app a year ago. Stopped using it after I few months and unsubscribed on my Play Store. Was surprised to see a few days ago that I was charged for another annual membership. When I talked to the customer service they claimed that I didn't unsubscribe from the web app and that I why I was charged (I never used the web app, but only the android app). They don't want to issue the refund and you can't delete your payment option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cant use the watch version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Used it for 3 years! I got a new phone and all my entries are GONE!! I he ave written to them many times. No help! I had all my struggles with coved documented! This was supposed to be a safe and secure place to journal!! I want a refund! Guess what! They don't give refunds!! DO NOT TRUST THIS APP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this a really great diary app.. I think that you will as well It does everything I could ask.. pictures files weather.. Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Damn I sure like this app. Even with the free version it still comes in clutch. When I get enough money and a sustainable income, I sure would immediately purchase the premium version. Keep up the good work devs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Overpriced. I am unhappy with the app. Customer Service refused a refund even though it was requested within 24 hours of purchase. I recommend to use the free features and do not purchase. I am disputing the charge with my credit card."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A lot of features when doing a journal, simplest yet very functional. It just have some ads and keeps on offering premium deal, anyway, it is a business so they can do what they want but sometimes it's annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app help me record my activities and some key things ..great app easy to navigate I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best life event online diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a pretty nice app. I enjoy it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app seems really good, If only it could remind me to write in it. Unfortunately the in qpp notifications don't show up until you go into the app? Defeats the purpose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2015 and loved it. I switched to an iPhone from an android phone and tried to sync my 10k+ entries from the cloud. It's been 4 days and it still synching. Then right at the 2K mark, it stops working and the app won't open. Now I have to uninstall and reinstall to start over again. I reached out to tech support for help and they keep saying wait for it so synch. I even imported my back up files to see if that would help. It's definitely buggy in the IOS platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good save life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good and easy to use but have to pay for the microphone and other features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sync issues from time to time. But overall I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for years. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient & easy journal application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this app immensely. When I have a thought, I start a new entry and hit the microphone button on my keyboard to record my voice to text. Doesn't get any easier than that. Add a pic or two and tags, and I'm done. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App hasn't worked right since most recent Android update. App automatically adds a space between paragraphs any time I try to edit. Half of my recent entries disappear as soon as I try to save them. I'm keeping old entries for posterity, but I'm not planning to add anything new. I'll find a better app with which to do so. Update: App also doesn't sync between devices consistently, even if one is paying for an upgraded membership. Not worth it. Update: The app developer's response was useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a great app for journaling. It is important that they fix the need to change fonts and sizes of the words (improve on the word processing). The fact that you can sync your data across platforms is a game changer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😇❤️😘"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I keep all my recipes in this app and I journal in this app also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"My Datas are wipeout automatically.😡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I give it a 4.75! I was introduced to this app a few years ago. I take so many photos, they're like my journal. I love that I can get caught up on memories and Journey suggests changing the date of the entry to when my attached photos were taken. I use this app when I make photobooks for my children because I can search for their names and find entries related to stories about them. I do wish there was an option to download the journal entries withOUT photos for easier printing though..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am using it since last 4 yrs.. now I change my phone and I lost last 1 yr data..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Loving this app so far. It allows me to jot done those thoughts from the day and express things that I would normally allow to slip by unaccounted for. I have successfully made an entry every day for over a month."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"lifesaver"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app used to work perfectly but now i cant even type a single sentence cause i cant see what am typing it does not show on screen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary / therapy !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Bagus , sangat membantu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and very convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an incredibly useful ap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I want to cancel but can't figure out how. I will make my rating a 4 star if I can get a reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Easy transition from years of paper journals. Don't like the fact that data cannot be deleted. Used it when it was free but with the paid version did not feel the price was worth what I was getting. App is not for me anymore"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome. But the prompts for buying pro are very annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's alright - aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. Wouldn't go premium though...it has everything I need already 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this every day - it has always been reliable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I let my subscription expire last month. When I signed in today, I had an offer to resubscribe for $17.?? for the year. I decided to take up the offer, but when I paid for it, I was billed me for the full price. I AM TEMPTED TO CANCEL JUST FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF TRICKING ME INTO RESUBSCRIBING AT FULL PRICE. LIVE AND LEARN!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Favorite journal app ever!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am extremely upset. I didn't get a reply to my enquiry. They charged me money when all I wanted was a trial. I am $70 out of pocket now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App works great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been an extremely helpful app, allowing me an easy way to collect and focus my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recommend this app to my clients for their own mental health journeys. I only recommend books and tools to my clients that I utilize and I can help navigate on what is useful or what to avoid."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep a journal. I find the interface to be very apealing and beautiful. The app makes it easier to add and organize entries. Adding pictures and videos is easy. I like that everything is backed up to Drive. It's also great that I can add entries from my phone or any web browser."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is still an amazing app and it continues to grow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is private it is easy and convenient and I have not found any glitches. There are a few ads to add more features to it but they're not often and you can just ignore them and go past them so they're not bothersome for journaling and diary I would recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had a review dating back to 2017 which no longer really reflects the current state of the app. I still think Journey is the best journaling app I've used so far if you value cross platform compatibility and cloud syncing more than anything else. It also has a really great UI that looks good, works well and is consistent across platforms. However I am currently using DayOne instead because I really value having in line photos. If Journey were to add that feature I would switch back instantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This one is cool I downloaded but I changed my mind but I'll have to use it again one day it's really fun and I like some Diaries journals with stickers and :-) cool and I like it and I give it five stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary app, It's a practical application, Maybe the app doesn't have a lot of colors and shapes And it makes you pay for the few colors and change the background image or cover, But it is a practical and convenient application unlike flashy applications that lack practical characteristics, My only problem is that it needs to support Arabic better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app to create a photo journal for my daughter. I love how you can upload a camera photo and it automatically updates time, date and place. Also love how you can export to Ms word for editing and printing. Best I've found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, it maps out my trips and shows me where I have been. It groups and tags all my life. They did start doing a subscription after I got the pro version and lost some features I had in the upgraded version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journal apps ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it because I love the Google integration. Voice, video, photos. Drawing on new iPad air doesn't work though with Apple pencil. Pity. Still very happy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'm annoyed how accidentally typing the enter key twice deleted almost all of my typed text in an instant. There's no undo, and I've typed the same thing twice today and all have been shredded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good, fast diary for every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I so love this app so much. It allows me to log in pictures, stories and audio of my grankids. It allows me to also include the date, my current mood, my location and the current weather from when I am writing in the journal. That means I get to look back and see what the weather was like, how was my mood and where I was when I wrote in the journal so that I don't forget. I highly recommend this app-Journey. It's amazing. I give it five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. Can access via app, web, desktop.. so flexible. It has backup to gdrive automatically, no concern if it got lost or swap device"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it specifically for my travel. If it had the option to create folders, I'd love it even more! Still... 5 🌟 because this is the best app I have found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems to work, but I prefer typing in landscape mode. This does not support that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can write everything down like a diary and I feel safe writing on it :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mother has loved this app for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the fantastic app. Its soo relaxing. You can write paste pic videos nd other. Interface is soo gud as living the old memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite journal for years now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I uses it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to add travel memories and daily activities to my gratitude journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I appreciate this app a lot. Nice to have a space where I can air out my emotions freely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you also agree that writing is one of the most sane making practices, here's a pretty good outlet. Wish export and sentiment analysis was easier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for the lifetime subscription and everything was great for years. I got a new phone and suddenly it won't let me login and seems to have lost everything. I'm heartbroken for all the memories I had in there and also annoyed that I paid for a lifetime subscription that I can't use now. I emailed the support team so we'll see what they say"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journal app! I have been using it for a few years now, easy to use and to backup my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app I got the unlimited plan very happy with it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that has people behind the scenes to help with technical issues. It felt good to know I could talk to a real person for help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid a load of extra cash for the 'android-only features' but I can't see what extra features I've got after paying all that money. Furthermore, one thing which I find really annoying is the notification system. There is a notification reminding you that you can write a journal entry today if you want to. However, this notification only appears on the phone when you actually open the app, and not otherwise. It defeats the whole purpose! The notification should appear on its own."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Four years and can't be grateful enough!!! It's the best app for me so far, purchased too🌼thank you so much for this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal app! I have been using it for 6 years now. I can add entries and insert pictures easily and it automatically notes the date and time. Daily journaling is so easy with this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keep all my daily thoughts and Scripture studying on this platform. Keep it backed up and have it where ever I go to look back upon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful 👍👍👍👍👍 loved it 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good to include pictures whenever I use the journal to inspire and motivate journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, appears stable after a day of intense use and many entries. After using the app for one month I decided to edit my initial 4 stars and give it 5 stars as it is a pretty stable & useful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and secure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Every time I got a new device, I have get some troubles to syncing my data.i have emailed and don't receive any response from help and support team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Won't require a password when first opened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm not the best with keeping a journal or diary, but this really helps and works for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to start writing a journal. Been using this app since 2017 and I can still look back to my entries from then. I can compose a new entry using my phone or PC which is very convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Beware! I bought a lifetime premium subscription a few years ago but they canceled it saying that they improved the app and now they request a huge annual fee. Aggressive people on support team. Couldn't get a refund. I imported all my entries in another app I found on playstore and ended my bad experience with Journey. Avoid this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent this is what i was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it... it's very easy to use and has great features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought this app 3 years ago. Haven't used it in a while, but I needed info from an old diary. Went to check and all my old diaries have been deleted. I am totally screwed without that info."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent app to keep track of your daily happenings and look back at your memories. One app I always use daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good, well designed and simple to use app to journal anything. You can also back-up and export your data. Highly recommend. It could do with features such as default tag(s) - very useful if I want to write gratitudes every day. Or the possibility to have a default note template..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!!! An awesome way to make a note of the day... AND they actually answered my ""help"" email to resolve a sync issue. Bravo!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but now that they want you to pay for it, I hardly find that it's worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app- let's you look forward to looking back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Visually appealing and pretty intuitive to use. It's a good place to consolidate lots of miscellaneous information along with my reflections. I think it will make it easier to keep track of things. A new type of journaling for the digital age - a tool I didn't realize I needed until I tried it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription last August and this is proven by playstore stating that there is no subscription to cancel yet they have still billed me. Every time I attempt to contact them via email they refuse to reply and the help desk continues to state the person is away so I can't contact this Chinese company in any way. The playstore has been no help as this is the second time this has happened and they refuse to help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is very usefull in daily basis of recording"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app really is great looking and easy to use, but the fact that all your data is locked in the app unless you pay for a relatively expensive subscription is not acceptable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this App for a few years now. I get use out of it everyday. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I subscribe monthly, but it is well worth the cost. I love how easy it is to make an entry, and how the app can remind you to journal each day. Best of all though, I like how easy it is to move selected journal entries between Journey and my blog. Love the interface design too, everything is intuitive, so there's less of a barrier between you and what you want to create."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for years. Initially I used it just to record what I could remember from my childhood but now I upload photos and describe them. I love this app and that you can look on the map to see where all the entries are throughout your life. I do wish I could grab photos from Google photos, that would be awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good apk"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years I'm kind of amazed how well all my stuff is kept and how secure it seems to be. I'm so glad my pictures and memories are preserved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I used this app successfully on my Windows laptop, and on my Android phone. However on my Chromebook I can't create any new entries. I can see my previous entries, and open a new entry, but when I type nothing appears on screen, and after a couple of minutes the new entry just closes without saving anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Currently using unpaid version... But I love the smoothness of the interface...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not bad thats good for daily routine diary📓"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost one year important data from Journey. I tried contacting the customer care as well but didn't get any answer. Never trust this application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best diary app I've tried :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. My favourite Secret garden!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful good aap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeping a journal was the last thing I wanted to do. Journey made it easy for me to keep track of my food and exercise in words and pictures. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its very nice apps .taking notes wheneve you want, drafting your plan.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It do be doing what it says it does, dawg"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cannot delete data, they won't allow it. Weird and sketchy app. Don't use it if you want full control over your personal info and data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Gotta let me use it first before forcing me to subscribe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app for quick journaling. Keeps me accountable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very useful to express my emotions and thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"@Journey.cloud app is a scam and first thing in cancelation policy is, NO REUND!! After u cancel the Free subscription, they don't send confirmation and charge you anyway. Beware scam!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish I could rate your app without leaving it. still grateful for Google Play"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"If you reduce your standard subscription fee and remove the annoying push notifications about fire sales and half off that happen at least every hour, I'm sure you'll see a higher conversion rate. Try it and see."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dear developers, I dont mind the constant ads pop up, but i would like more creative options without paying. Instead of a plain blackground , maybe theres an option for a seasonal background, like xmas, halloween, etc... Because i get bored with those blue buttons heheheee otherwise, it's a nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, I love this app so much, it has everything I need in a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for the past 5 years and still works the same."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I like the app but the sneaky way they charge you $40 for an annual subscription doesn't sit right with me. I've canceled my account I will never go anywhere near this product again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app -- works perfectly for all of my journaling needs 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Purchased this since 2016, and still using this app. My everyday companion. Very useful and helpful to me. Love this app.❤️❤️❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been searching up and testing different journaling and diary apps for several days and Journey ended up being the best so far. It has both a website and app so i can use it from anywhere, it saves the data in drive and is extremely user friendly. So far, the app works splendid without any problems. (Although it would be better if the app stopped recommending to buy the Pro version all the time & wish the sync with drive was faster and more efficient)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I tried many of the Journaling applications available and enjoyed journey the most. I really like the ability to make easy entries, add pictures, and have a geo tag. I would love to see the map get some simplification - the pictures over the geotags make for a cluttered map. Otherwise, no gripes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Access on phone tablet or Online, a calendar that shows days I Journaled. still learning to use the format text Features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm helping!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well for my simple needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There's a paid option for this app. But the free version is so good and feature packed it doesn't feel like it's starving you of necessary features tucked behind a paywall. I've been using this app for 3 years now, and not once have I ever had any issues with it. Definitely recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love being a le to add my photos and deleting then from my Google pics. This is my personal Facebook where the world doesn't need to see."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. Keeps my private thoughts private and allows me a quick and convenient way to jot down anything I need to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does what it's supposed to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Annoying sale pop ups through out the app ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this as a journal for seven years. I love how it operates seamlessly across all my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for a few years now. I like it alot. I do wish that I couold use different fonts and that I coulod figure out a way to use my templates from my computer version on the mobile app. But overall it is good. I like the seeing the throwbacks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love Journey. It helps me each morning get my day started."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you'd like to be alone with your memories rather than being loud on social media, this app is the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Beware: FRAUDULENT CHARGES! I disabled auto-pay through Google, and now it seems to be reactivated through the app itself. This is not an opportunity to be taken advantage of. I reached out to customer service to refund this charge, and all they've asked me for is a receipt of this charge? It's been a day and a half after submitting this receipt, and I have yet to hear back from them. UPDATE 2 DAYS LATER: Be aware if you renew manually, ""auto-renewal"" will AUTOMATICALLY be re-enabled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's pretty good but there is a frequent glitch where it will delete a load of what I write. This means I need to save frequently, which of course I often forget to do. So I have lost significant amounts of writing several times now. Am going to try another app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a good app but seriosly the amount of ads for the premium version is a joke. Instead of making me buy the app I'm considering deleting it and getting an alternative that doesn't annoy me as much Update: Uninstalled it, if you keep the free version the amount of ads are unbearable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using journey for six years now, through several seasons of life, and it is like an old friend I can talk to. I really appreciate this app evolving over time and how flexible it is to use on days when I have more time for it or less."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gives good insight in behavior"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever Subscribed 2 days back and cancelled that day only today 3700 got debited Im going to complaint fraud transaction against this transaction and you at cyber crime"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use it every day for my diary. I have been doing so for over two years with the paid version on Android and as a Chrome application. I would have given it 5 stars if it had coloured text, but I'm just being fussy. Unfortunately, export to docx has its problems and the developers have not been forthcoming with a fix or any contact with me on progress. Such a shame. Update Aug 2022. Still love the app and now have coloured text but 3 problems persist and are not fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good free ise app but with many annoying purchase pop ups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cant access premium facilities on android device. Previously i used iPhone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Good idea, but terrible execution. After i paid for premium, I've sent an email asking for help about my specific trouble, no one cared to reply(still, weeks passed) to an email from a paid customer. Take your money elsewhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is very nice to use. It is well organised"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always love this app. I put everything I can remember in this Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and lots of neat features, even on free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Issue resolved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple interface. Useful and easy to use. Able to attach photos and videos. Variety of ways to review the past and search."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I have used it for a few years now and it's be very useful. It's a nice way to keep up with memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You'll cancel your subscription but they'll keep charging you. Beware!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"still chill"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using the app for 2 days now and it's great!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app daily for years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its great. Ibuse as a video diary and a food journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I tried various diary apps over the last few years. Some were quite decent. However, I always find out later that the app comes short in one way or the other. I've been using Journey for about a week now. I'm very impressed with it so far. Its got all the features that I wanted, it's pleasant to look at and easy to navigate. I like the cloud based back up and restore feature. It's syncs effortlessly and accurately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good journalling app. I can easily search for entries and also gives me a throwback. Good deal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good customer support!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Long and hard but ultimately and supremely rewarding ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Rubbish, paid for the premium service and none of my entries this year was synced, only last year's and before. Support is a joke, never answer chat and the email link they give you is invalid."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was charged an annual Subscription. I didn't even had this app or heard about I need request a refund ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This was a great kind of word space I needed but I did not understand how to do simple stuff for this app like changing color for the words. Clearly i don't get it. But this app is good enough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely journal. I really love the app. Suitable for everyday use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling instead of overthinking really helps. Love this app. I'm on the road to a better me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice experience for the last 3 year. Even if I am using free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful and creative ""diary"" for journaling my thoughts and feelings..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Opened the app today to a messsge ""Migration complete"". No information on what migration. The Canadian Geese? There are now zero entries, and everything is lost. This is not a new device. It is the original device the app was installed on. It's amazing how ads, animations, paywall barrier notifications all work flawlessly. If you want to trust your information to be kept safely by this company you have my respect as a real adrenaline seeker. Apparently all my entries migrated elsewhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best memo."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never be YouTube bro"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Only drawback is that changing your email address is a pain. Would LOVE the option to link to prior entries too, like you can in a blog. I use it all the time for everything from quick entries with photos of memories I want to keep to long deep reflections into my psyche (therapy trainee). Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Maybe the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've always been a paper journaler but I love the security of the password protection and the ease of attaching to a post to keep everything together. I've tried a few electronic journals and this have been my favorite."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Purchased July 2022. Much faster than Evernote. Good timestamp on each entry! Across platform diary. Works well. Good window handling on PC. Only needs a few tweaks: 1) attach anything; 2) better search within notes; and 3) better image handling within notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"No way to add voice recording. It should have been easier to view the photos (just sliding instead of entering gallery mode first). The calendar view looks outdated, it should be more eye catching"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I hate when an app wants me to pay for separately for my android phone and my iPad. It's just ridiculous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, been using for years. Can access it in more than one device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Best looking interface of all the free journal apps I've tried. But you have to pay to change the colors. Even then, it's pretty limited. But I'm a graphic designer. I'm pickier about that stuff. As far as the UX, it's pretty great. You can add tags to your entries so they're organized and easy to find. You can also adjust the timestamp. So if you write about last Tuesday it'll look like you posted it that same day. Great app overall. Simple, clean, easy to use. Just needs more customization"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good diary. It has proved to be a great assistance in being more productive. Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid on Apple for my iPad device but they want me to pay the same again to use the service on my android phone as well. No way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfect... don't change a thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app since 2018 to now. I wish was not this expensive to explore the paid version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app does what it says and performs reliably. Just pay *very* close attention to their cancelation policy especially if you are not subscribing through Google."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Heavy when opening. The app keep pestering me to subscribe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does what is advertised with a clean, easy to use interface. I don't feel the need to use any other app for journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its fine. Served its purpose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There are a lot of ads for buying the upgraded version and I have no idea what features that has. But for just a simple journal this blows everything else out of the water. It is so simple and easy to make new entries and it is easy to search for old entries by date or keyword or tag that you put on them. You can even add pictures which I wish I remembered more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect organisational system. Brought lifetime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not my cup of tea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great little app. I've tried keeping regular diaries on paper but just never keep it up. Having a notification and cute app to use, I've kept it up! With pictures too. Recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Deleted an entire year's worth of time consuming important journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use it often. I definitely recommend and personally have zero complaints so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using the app for a couple of years and really love it. I love journaling but I would always go so long between entries because I would get lazy. I still don't journal everyday like I should but with this app I'm doing much better. I love that I can put pictures for the day, that it has automatic location and temperature, so when I look back in my journal all that information was automatically put in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what I was looking for. A place to put a few pics and thoughts about things we did on each day of our trip."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great digital journal! So glad I found this resource for journaling my issues and thoughts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"My controlling (no ex) figured out all you have to do is delete the app, then re-download it and then you are able to make up a new pass code and read everything. Not very secure if you ask me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love journey for everything it is. Have been using it since 7 years now and it has only got better with time. :')"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app, I use daily. Happily paid to upgrade and keep it secure. 10 years worth of entries in here! The only way to improve would be for the voice typing to be more accurate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, but would like to be able to use a monospace font for programming notes and text alignment. A global setting would be great! PS: I keep getting notifications to upgrade and offers even though I purchased a lifetime free licence. Edit: Deleting text is buggy and causes arbitrary letters and even lines to be incorrectly removed. Still usable, but it's a bit annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like it: 1) no Advertsmt see in free version , only limited access to function 2) hv Location tagged which is really good for travel diary 3) Can syn my data with log in acct without joining member so able get my data to my new phone. Don't like: 1) background wallpaper only plain color choose. Boring whn writing. 2) expensive 1 time payment choice 3) monthly subscription also expensive than other apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Current mobile version sucks big time. Doesn't work at all and keep on hanging. Can't type or can't even copy paste, can't save. Old posts are not in proper order by date. Worst version ever.. i hope this is all rectified at earliest"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found this to be an excelljournal to record my daily devotions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Edit 2022, years later. The sync and security fail to reach Google approval And I almost lost data with a new phone. I would never use this app again. 2017: Best journal app. I recommend the one time upgraded not the monthly subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very user friendly and without any glitches. Even the free version is good to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app and unique when compared to others. Bought the android premium and happy. Few issues syncing but sorted after unauthorising google account and authorising it again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice journal. Thankful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Had it for over 4 years. I would highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to use! Just hope that the location can link to Google map so that it allow more precise tagging! Also hope to upload both video and photo in the same post. Hope can put photo within the post itself rather than act like an attachment. Other than that, it is a perfect diary app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very pretty, Sleek, and easy to use. I love the functionality of media usage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App and very helpful CS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Constamt upgrade adds but great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It doesn't say that it costs before you download it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Iv used this app a few years and sometime in the last update, it now asks for a password. I never had a password and never set one up. Now I can not get into it. Very disappointing. Looking for something new. But not this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is ncie so far. I've been using the free version for a few.days now and it has been nice. Haven't experienced amy bugs yet or any incoveniences. I've been using it as my food diary. Maybe I'll comeback for another review after a few months."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Nice app but too expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"UK to, hki yjف نعانمtلمtj eytrhy the rhythm the the the rhtrthrtoph ryr hurt hey her that the ytjy just tyjtt uht ttnhhk,jtjmymjy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and safe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"3 day free trial"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"new user,haven't upgraded and im happy.🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping track of your adventures"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app indeed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ใช้ง่ายดี ไม่ซับซ้อน สะดวกเวลาพูดแล้วมันจดเป็น diary ลงไปเลย มาหาอีกทีก็ง่ายดี"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App has stopped functionng. It opens but not able to make entries at all. Deleted and reloaded app with no success. Very upsetting as I paid for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Functions great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!! All I can do now is warn others to stay away. I have contacted this company several times and no one responded, so I'm leaving a review to let you all know DO NOT BE SCAMMED! I tried the free trial and tried to cancel but it subscribed the FULL YEAR automatically WITHOUT THE DISCOUNT. The premium version WILL NOT WORK ON MY PHONE AND I'VE ASKED THE COMPANY SEVERAL TIMES HOW THEY CAN MAKE IT RIGHT AND THEY WON'T RESPOND!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super Top Experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very friendly to use app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is actually really cool. With the premium I can record my voice or just do a simple video without premium and I can just do simple text entry. Overall this app is definitely worth downloading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't delete data and all that you capture? Hmm"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful tool in processing my thoughts and emotions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been smooth, even for free users. Thank you so much for your consistency over 4 years of usage. There's none better to recommend as a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was charged for a year subscription which I did not authorize. Minutes after I got the notification, I disputed it hoping they would refund the amount charged. They did not. They were in contact with me in the beginning and said they would contact their billing department, but it has already been over a month. I cancelled my credit card and removed all cards from Google. This sucks being charged for something I didn't ask for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After years and years, still using it and still loving it. The mod integration is nice and the stats are very useful. I like the UI, it's simple and it does what it should without any problems or strange design decisions. So, absolutely, still my perfect diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's great I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had this on my previous phone which was on a 3G network and LOVED the app. Now that I have a 5G phone, though, I am not as happy because I lost all the photos/journal entries going back to about 2012 or thereabouts. Sure wish I could get them back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, I've been using for 4years now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for 5 years and I just love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My digital journal. I love it been using it since 2016."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this for daily Journaling. I like the throwback feature so I can easily see progress. I LOVE: geo tags, weather records, being able to save pictures or recordings, and quick snapshots mood. This app is all encompassing in those ways. As far as functionality, I like being able to search key words and geographic area entries. I wish adding fonts colors was easier, could be done in batch. Would be nice to have an option to track what you're listening to at the time of entry besides hashtags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update 07.04.22: I've had this app since 2019 and I LOVE it!!! It has continued to improve over the years. BACK TO 5 STARS!!! As promised I updated my review giving 5 stars again since the developer repaired the issue I was having. It is the very best app for journaling! I've tried many and this one is the easiest to use and most versatile being available on PC as well. Highly recommend! 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it since it's pretty basic and that's what I was looking for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! Been using this since 2016. It's just that I think it would be better if we can have an option to choose which cloud service we want to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Just that a lot of inapp purchases cost a lot of money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I downloaded but canceled due to cost of service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reinstalled it after 3 years. Quite well made. I wish they put in the same effort for the Windows app as after installing it, I'm wondering whether the same people made it. For 20 USD, build quality wise it's not even close to that of a free app. There is no privacy as well. Still haven't figured out what the lock button locks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: So after almost 45 days since downloading I have about 18 entries (a couple were 2 short ones from same day) but that's an average of around every 3 days! Happy w/ the interface I mostly use the speech to text entry method haven't really added to yet Great for a journal/diary Used to write ✍️ mine occasionally but this is helpful as 1. You can use voice to text 2. You carry phone around so it's right there! May even read in some of my old journal entries on same days but past year's!?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this simple format and easy access to keeping my thoughts in one place. I just wish there was a way to print. And a way to give someone access when I'm gone from this world for them to print or read."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years. Very reliable and very easy to navigate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When you open you get directly to the page where you need to pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Experienced some hiccups while downloading it on another phone as the entries wouldn't show up, but I emailed the dev team and the entries showed up again! Thanks for the help!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use and great for those that don't like actually writing by hand. As a I'm getting into family history, I find this app is an awesome tool for recording family stories with pictures to preserve your families history. Very easy to save links from social media sites and record by voice as well. Also tranfers from old to new divises with ease. Thank you so much for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"journaled every day on this app for 9 months. It's perfect, I love it to pieces, and I haven't had any complaints. A lot of useful but not forced features, not too complex. It's perfect for my needs! My only complaint is that photos can't be rearranged once uploaded, so you have to upload them one by one in the order you desire."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app. It's the only journal I have been able to use on a regular basis. It has everything I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Loving every minute of this diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just as needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a great app for daily Journaling. The visualization if the calendar helps you not to break the chain if you are trying to make a habit of of it. The one thing I wish you could do is the ability to make your own journal template. Like if you have certain prompts that you want to answer, you would be able to use a template to create a journal entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good! Want even more! I wish it integrated with more apps like fitbit. I'm a paid user and new to the app. I have failed making journaling a habit my whole life. Ease of use is working for me. I might succeed this time! I didn't realize how much my journaling depended on having it available anytime, anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Edited the 5* review because sometimes I have trouble downloading the attached images of videos from my entries. I meant to directly save the to Journey, thinking I'd be able to dl them later if needed, but I suppose I'll have to keep a backup in my phone. Way to add duplicates everywhere :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it gives me a freedom of expression and will make you feel better when you are down. So many great features easy to use I love throwbacks there my favorite 😍. 5 starrs all day long"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good, i like the courses it gives"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app, I can always get my data back with whatever phone or pc I use. Just log in the account and your good to go. Please continue with your convenient service. Thank You so much for the hardwork."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Literally as soon as you download the app your prompted to buy premium per year. And if you go the offer is gone forever as it goes back to £42 a year. The offer was for £15, thats just disgusting I haven't even tried your app yet to decide for myself if I want to pay or not. Pure greed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using journal for almost a year now and it's quick and easy gui is wonderful. Solid app with no frills ease and reliability. June 20, 2017 - Still loving the app. Only suggestion would be to select multiple pictures rather than having to go back after each selection."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Deleted it took a lot of effort I had used this app for years and paid for premium but they had new memberships introduced which meant I couldn't use the app anywhere else apart from my phone. That's fine. BUT the PAIN of migrating 1000's of entries because they have made it so hard. Even after paying for the membership the export fucntionalities crash and don't produce the data. I'd recommend others to use Joplin or something else if you want to consider long time storage"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Grt app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good solid app for keeping journals and diaries. I like that you can view your diary on the web. I wish it would stop nagging me about changing the date and time of the entry every time I add a photo though. UPDATE: It is now 4 years since someone posted a reply claiming that they would look into the annoying issue that I mentioned in my original review and nothing has improved. As a matter of fact this app has not improved much at all in those for years so I'm downgrading my rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"can i have template mode for writing, like if every new post of mu journal have format like: 1) Things i did good today: 2) Things i did not good today: 3) What i could improve for tomorrow:"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love my journal I just hate you have to pay to back it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I enjoy using Journey but the ads are excessive & overbearing. It would be great if we could attach more than 1 media type in an entry also (e.g. a video AND pictures). The same media type limit applies even on premium. There are times you want to record an experience in different ways & this app doesn't make that easy. I guess you could have multiple entries for a day but that could become unwieldy quickly. Good app nonetheless. Would be 5 stars if it weren't for the media limit & excessive ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extremely beneficial to busy people like me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has been such a helpful and friendly app. It has been there in my worst and best times. I have always hesitated with a journal app because I want to be able to preserve my personal history and feelings, and Journey has made me feel safe about my data. I can't taste it hugh enough. Thank you Journey ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, highly recommended 🦋"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the free version and find it to be very enjoyable, you can write simple journal entries and attach a few images to is as well! I also love that there is a pin to enter the journal, perfect for spilling all those thoughts out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app. Easy to use, ads not too intrusive. Lovely flexible approach to entries, easy to add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice experience with this application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using for about a week, seems like a good app so far no issues. Interested in layout options for how journal entries with pictures can be formatted better. Currently what I see is photos are considerably larger than what I would want in a printed journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years. I basically purchased on sale because I wanted to have the dark mode. I really like it. It offers many features I love and did not expect. Linking photo and maps is a fun tool and I enjoy the look back notifications. It is easy to use and there are no ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful. I love this app. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does the things"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, but please bring back landscape support for use on tablets. It's very frustrating when an app launches rotated 90°."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app that is so neat and failsafe that one feels like writing more. No other app matches it's features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app! it sucks that some of the features are locked behind a (expensive) paywall but otherwise it's really great and I would recommend it to other people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is good and can attach photos. But the font size is small. Difficult to read after typing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used a different app for years. I've now used this one for over a year. This app is perfect with a light fresh design that is intuitive. I upgraded to use all the features and just renewed because it's worth paying for. I like that I can include photos of the day. I'm really loving the journaling prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful diary keeping app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a pretty solid free diary, much much better paid version. Very easy to learn, edit and sync over multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Frustrating that the app constantly pushes the subscription, by letting you ""access"" key features that would be subscript only, then letting you hit the button and popping up the subscription feed. For a while, I kept trying to italicize text and the popup kept coming up, it was frustrating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great tool for me to be able to share my thoughts and journal on a regular basis, and I love the fact that I can use voice recognition to make entries. I only wish that it was easier to share my journal entries with my therapist. It would be nice to give a separate password access to individuals that want to view my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"What do I pay for?? Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Giving 5 stars back to the app. I had export backup issues. I instead changed my phone. Now the zip backup works perfect. Till now the app has been great. Just a suggestion that the previous header was way convenient and nice than the present ""stories"" header. I am a writer because I am nostalgic. I don't follow new trends. So stories header is a garbage. Atleast give an option to change that back. The old header gave so much info about total entries, total time, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My needs are simple and I'm not interested in the paid version perks. It does have dark mode. But alas, the ads aren't in dark mode and are blinding. But beggers can't be..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very usefull for my work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional product. I have been using this since 2018 , I purchased the app. Very user friendly, can be updated with past memories , I am writing journal daily . I recommend this app to you all ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have not had a chance to thoroughly go through the app yet, mainly due to being put off by receiving a prompt the first time opening it offering a one time only chance to upgrade at 50% off. I buy upgrades to apps if I like them, but why would anyone purchase an upgrade to an app before even having a chance to check it out? It just kind of rcomes across as a money grab. Maybe put up the offer after the app has been used for a few days or give a few days deadline before it expires?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect backup of text and attachments. However, I do wish the app would lock automatically when I switch screens to another app. Also, while switching the screens, diary entries are visible completely. A lock screen( password entry screen) should be visible between app switches and not the entries. Just my two cents."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I can not write anything on app but I can write my journal on web version, why is this happens. Besides I can't see my previous journal on app as well Just showing me the attached picture but no text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's pretty good, but it's not entirely private. When I view all running apps in my Android phone, a screenshot of the last activity in the Journey app is shown. That makes the passcode useless, can you at least make it a black screen like how the android camera phone does it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this Diary & Journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this app and have been using it for a few years. Love the fact that I can upload photos & memories of my family & view it as yearly memories. Only draw back is the limitation to only upload photos or 1 video. Used to be able to upload both in the past. Membership is a bit pricey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. No fuss digital journal or diary. I love the photo and map feature. Makes it visual to see what photos I've taken, and where. Makes it easy to look back too. The only downside is if you have different devices, you need to pay premium for each. 😕 Only paid premium on my android phone but have the basic features on my ipad and pc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am able to write in Telugu and English, almost similar to writing in diary. I found this app very useful for journaling. Iove the app. Formatting options made it more attractive. Thank you developer team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being able to write my thoughts and inspirations in a place I can always go to. It has become essential to my spiritual studies and growth. Thank you for this app💫"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful awesome Diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I CANT CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION. I signed up yesterday with he intent to print my entries. Tried numerous different ways. No success. When signing up it stated a 3 free day trial...since It's not working for me I whet to cancel. After going to setting, profile, billing as it indicated there is ZERO option to cancel membership (as it shows with images under help desk of how to ""cancel journey.cloud membership."" There is a blue box in the image stating ""management membership"".) That's not an option!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, good functionalities"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"جميل جدا"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent App for diaries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not available on Microsoft Store as I am not an OS user on personal life ... and it's a bummer huhuhuhu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"An ability to select an entry/day and simply swipe left and right to the day after/before would make this a five star app for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app to have!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been the most success I have had in journaling. It's easy to use and I'm so glad I started."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ကဗ် ာေရး ၊ စာေရး ၊ မိမိအိမ္တြင္း သုေတသန ။"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I hope one day i could afford the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My mind!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app to capture a lot of things and journal it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome free daily diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for daily journaling as long as I can remember. It keeps getting better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this journey 😍 thank you 💋"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, been using this for a while now, medyo madami na akong na try na journal app but this one is the best for me so far. Thank you. God Bless all of you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Support doesn't exist. I've asked for assistance on billing question May 10 and no one has responded yet, it's May 17. One sentence in their chat response says, ""We will get back to you the next working day"". Another typical app, since they don't make money on support they don't adequately staff it, don't have it on the priority list or just ignore it. The app itself needs user experience staff to reduce the amount of unnecessary clicks to complete a task. May 25th - no response from support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still the best Journalling app for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"+3 stars: I like the layout: it is simple and user friendly. The calendar format is great to view my entries of my baby's achievements and memorable events. I also like the widget. -1 star: to attach videos/photos to an entry, it can only be within the last 330 of your own album that you have access to upload. This makes it virtually impossible to upload images to old entries. -1 star: the app for my smart watch is really pointless. It displays my latest entry and does not let me make entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am still using Journey as of May 2022 and still very happy with the app since my original review in 2016. Have used several including Diaro but found that Journey has the best mobile AND desktop interface. A pleasure to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like the journaling part. But of you only want the free version you have to deal with the subscription adds incessantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm sold! By far the best journal app out there. I have one question, I know it's synced with Google drive but can you add Google photo and let it automatically sync so the last million years of photos are on here? Please?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This application has been a gateway for me and my thoughts over the past several years. I have nothing bad to report and consistently recommend it to others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Geotag function no longer working. It is stuck on one location and is not updating based on my location. Very frustrating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super awesome and cute and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I forget it exists, but it never disappointes when I come across it randomly in my phone or on my chromebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Well, all the functions are good enough but I can't create a new entry directly and I can't edit the journal through the plus Icon . If I wanna create a new journal I had to go through enrolling on the experiments in couch section... In the editor I can't type and can't click save"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it everyday! I love that it syncs with the desktop app. Simple and easy to use on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent work God bless you all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A nice digital journal but some unavoidable flaws, being a digital platform, and at a financial price far greater than a usual physical diary whilst maintaining the certain liability to lose anything that may be stored. However, with the exception of freezing on occasions, there is a lot to utilise on this app which includes geological locations, uploads of photos and much more than fit into a review page. Highly recommended to try for oneself as not any one person has all the same preferences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps but please stop asking me to pay for pro version everytime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal and I use it all the time. As someone who has always wanted to keep a journal but never really committed to one, I can say this app really helped. I still go a few weeks at a time between entries sometimes, but just having a place to jot down all my thoughts and notes and revisit old throwback entries and have all the fun colors to use is nice. It's a safe place to just let it all loose and feels very customizable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal for my purposes, with time and Geo Stamp."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it gives me that quick place for a note or a good place for my daily thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic little app to build reflection into your life. Pause and reflect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's really high for what it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It looked adequate, but for me, it wasn't a fit. I need a good export option or options, they had nothing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is the perfect app for capturing, reviewing and building on your thoughts. I've mastered many mental paths forward by using this app to improve my thinking over time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app i can do it all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find the Journey app very useful. It is extremely helpful and allowing me to effortlessly record my thoughts. The Journey app is so useful to me, that I bought a yearly membership. I have the training app on both my phone and my tablet, and my data effortlessly synchronizes between the two devices. I will definitely be renewing my membership when the time comes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the fingerprint lock on the journal. I also enjoy the different background options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it ♥ it's very much better than other apps✨"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Suka banget dengan aplikasi ini"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simple. Easy to use. Does the job well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is now working again after the latest update. Thanks!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good programme"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Used the app for years but as they started turning features for a paid subscription, I feel the quality for free users dramatically dropped."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled the app coz I can't see what I'm writing and it keeps stopping 😇"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great as a journal, lots of features and easy to use. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have been using this amazing application since 2015. So many times changed devices, performed hard resets but upon installing application, never missed single entry....Untill this time...yes it missed all entries of last 4 months after re-installing application post hard reset this time...can't trust this anymore..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app! Lingtime user but recent fixes do not allow me to see what I am typing when typing it. It automatically scrolls up to a blank screen as if I am not typing anything. PLEASE FIX!!!! Love this app!! NEEDS FIXING THOUGH!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. Can't compare to others. But does job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The application is very straightforward and user friendly. Thanks dev team 🤟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, been using it since 2012 to journal my life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent program"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for cross platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love , simple and particle"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really love the paid version so I can add more photos to my post, and the throwback post feature is really nice as a reminder of what I've journal's in the past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reliable diary app, a bit clunky when it comes to archiving, but it works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app was fine, but it just randomly uninstalled itself from my device? Strange..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, just what I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the smoothest journaling solution I've tried out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best one app I have using from two years amazing and such a good 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Fantastic. Just wish I could turn my phone to type and not have to hold my phone one way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So good so far, great concept. I would eventually like to purchase this app. I do wish there was a lock on the journal however."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app for memories and calendar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I paid for this a long time ago and It is perhaps the best app I have ever purchased in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"How do i carry my premium on android to ios device?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Found exactly what I'm looking for in this app. It's like a personal Instagram journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Its been perfect until i updated yesterday keyboard stopped working. Please get in touch with regards to issue or how to revert to previous workable version. Otherwise i will have to consider ending my subscription. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Subhanallah best journaling app. I use it their option of bigger font size which is comfortable for my eyes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Outstanding app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Updated review after a few year: yes the pricing and ads have getting more and more 'intrusive' but I still love the app. Yes there are cheaper alternatives but the atlas view, calendar view, and tagging, etc. all work flawlessly. Definitely worth it! Still keeping it 4 stars because it's not cheap compared to other alternatives I really enjoy this app. Easy to keep track of things. It would be 5 star if if we're able to pull date/time/geotag from photos that I add from Google photo. It does it when I add from my own gallery but not from Google Driv, although the photo from Google does have all the info in them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app, keeps your thoughts private, better than writing in an actual paper journal. I needed this, so glad I found it. 2 thumbs up! Just had to add, I love the reminder feature so that i never get too busy too do an entry 💜...i love this app! *update* I still love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"They don't tell you BEFORE you make your purchase that A) Journey from email is not available via Android (so why advertise it?) B) Journal entries can not be made from forwarded emails."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app to write daily journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple n effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the ease of the journal entries and ability to add photos and a video."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Having a bit of difficulty figuring out app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have an older app called Day Journal, thought this might be a fit for upgrade, no luck."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I purchased the pro version of this app 6-7 years ago for something like $6, it was an amazing app and I rated it 5 stars in 2016. Today I'm disappointed by the direction the dev has taken this app in favour of greed. Features I paid for like unlimited sync have been withdrawn which is illegal. To have all the features the app offers one now needs to pay $159, a 2550% increase, or get a monthly sub for $10. Then ads have been added for no benefit other than making the dev money. Disgusting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the greatest experience to write feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for quick journaling on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app, easy to use, and not intrusive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. They keep running ads for premium service which is terribly annoying. Maybe they should just let people decide if they want premium and not run that ad every five seconds. Otherwise great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal / diary app. You can tag entries so it's easy to locate all of your related notes. You can add photos and it automatically records your location, and weather conditions at the time of your journal entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Who wants to pay for a journal?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journaling option. Fun to see memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"MISLEADING AND WILL HOLD YOUR INFORMATION HOSTAGE. I used this app to record sensitive stuff for over a year. When I transferred phones it didn't save any of it. I believe I had it linked up to my Gmail. It does say to have access to my past records I have to upgrade to premium and pay but I really seems as though it didn't save anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and nice experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and helps me keep track of all my days and events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal app to keep tabs on your thoughts. And reflection of dates events. I've also gotten used to opening the app just to jot down a thought that I have at the moment, one would think it's nonsense but sure helps with organizing a thought/ idea 💡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm along-time user of Journey. It's simple to use but comprehensive. I became a Prime (lifetime) member when the rates were still reasonable. Very pleased with app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Writing in this journal had helped me a lot. But an issue that I recently experience is when the application doesn't let me sync my entries. It is a big concern for me for the reason that I have been using my old device to write my journal. And suppose that it ceases to work, I wouldn't be able to have a record of my writings. Hope this will be fixed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and friendly app to keep your travel memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Clean. Elegant. Have been using it for 6-7 years now. Haven't found another one as good for the purpose it serves."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Didn't use it for a year and now it charges me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journeling app! I do enjoy and highly recommend it. The only complaint I have right now that I hope will be fixed soon, is that if I try to take a picture through the app rather than uploading from my gallery it often won't save the picture, but it will take it and seem like it's going to but then doesn't. I only upload pictures from my gallery. This doesn't make it unusable, but I hope it gets fixed soon!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this since 2015. Love being able to look back over my year to help me focus on goals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and good if you pay for it. Limited to 4 pics if you don't."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use and clean interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful to write different kinds of life events"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good but has all what I want (plz add to do list)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is everything it said it was and it is very nice. But the popups to sign on to premium is too frequent and not nice. I know there is a premium plan and I know where to go to subscribe to it. So can it stop popping up everytime I open the app..or at least reduce the frequency."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Was good until I cancelled the subscription! I cancelled the day before it was due to renew as I hadn't used it for ages. However, they still took the £28odd off my card!!! And is now say it will end on the 15th April 2023!!!!! This is absolutely disgusting I don't use it and don't want it! It was cancelled and therefore no money should have been taken! I cancelled the day before the renewal so it should of been cancelled full stop and no money taken before the renewal date!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Have had it since 2018 and it's cool looking back at old entries. Be sure to back up your data to a cloud periodically to avoid losing your entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super application for travel!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does everything I want it to, and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best app ever. Moreover, I like the fact that it's online"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"a premium? no"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good just advertisise membership to much and also has basic things set to membership only."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too many ads to buy premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has been very good for me. I like the fact I am able to record past and future journals. By doing this I am able to keep all my memories alive. I also like the throwback feature which you cannot do with ease on a physical journal. I have shared past memories with my family. I am able to record history like capturing newspaper clips. I would really recommend this app for anyone. I have been using now for more than five years and I would not swap it for any other app. Keep on improving."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"LOOKING FOR NEW DIARY SUPPOSE TO BE FREE TO TRY DON'T KNOW I LIKE SIGNED IN WITH GOOGLE BUT TELLS YOU TO SKIP GETTING A PAYMENT SCREEN EVERY TINR MO ACCESS WITHOUT MONEY IT SEEMS SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOU HAVE LOST IT LIKE I HAVE OTGER APPS THAT CHANGED THOUGHT I LIKE PAID TGEN HATED STILL OWN TGEN BUT CAN'T OR WON'T USE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Seems like a good app but I cannot import my day one journals. Keep getting errors and the support is really weak and slow in answering. Updated my review to one star because of the HORRIBLE customer support. Cannot use the app and cannot get a refund!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Kindly make an option to Sort your Entries DATE WISE when you install the app again or when you view them on browser. It's really annoying to see entries sorted randomly. Please!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good to record our diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, but a bit heavy on the deal offers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app for Journaling. Simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What should I say, I use it all the time. Cognitive offloading? May be. But also makes me a decent writer. Well sort of .... Reading my own words after years and trying to improvise them feels good. Also reminds me what happened before. Good or bad... I write emotionally, almost crying, hating...happy, thoughtful.. so it's over when it's written. So this app works for me. Like how a restaurant cook told me once "" I know when you like my food when you eat all of it and leave a clean dish""..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey since 2016, it's a great app perfect in everyday for what I need. I love all the features. It's a great way for me to capture whatever my highs and lows as well my adventures. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use my journal all the time. Love the set up and ease of use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite most useful app ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very well organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! I find it slightly frustrating that I can't tell which guided journals I've completed. It makes it hard to pick my next one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing journal. Simply amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a very cool and very fun app!! I really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My Go To.. Easy to use, love the throw backs..helps you to identify patterns that have been repeating. Would be amazing if AI was incorporated to read your mood, personality, habits, etc. The name Journey signifies a progression over time so being able to track changes to your mindset, lifestyle, personal growth, would seem like a natural progression. There is an SMS app ""Mei"" that uses AI to read the personalities of you and those you text most. It also makes guesses about relationships & ages."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pleasure to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I lost everything I was writing after accidentally hitting paste when selecting everything & it doesn't allow you to go back and have everything return which is why I'm uninstalling the app. I would reconsider if the issues with undoing get fixed. along with it would also be nice to have a graph/table option & a way to organize the page"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Acetylene"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Super slow and unmanageable app when you have a lot of content. I regret buying this as it is unusable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I subscribed! I downloaded a few picture journals and trialed all of them. I found Journey had the easiest and cleanest interface. The customer support responded to me during my trial which other apps didn't. All the features the list works great and they're looking to build and develop it more. Great job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. I just hate that when I've gotten new phones that I've lost my previous journal entries They have now linked up and I thank you much for your help! This app is awesome and a wonderful way of writing what happens through my journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app twice now while travelling. I have found it easy to use and well presented when finished."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An app helps me manage my own thought and reveal my true feeling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I use it as a one-line-a-day journal to capture some of the funny things my kids say, and I'm sure I will treasure some of these stories as we get older"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best to capture the daily essence of life. Need to be in every smartphone who just like to record daily happenings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really basic but really good!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I accidentally tapped the remove account in the device.from the settings I liked the app but I can't redo it now all of the words I wrote except one survived is there really no way I can retrive it?...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just downloaded the app and paid the annual membership. While using the app on my tablet, the screen will not rotate to horinontal to use with my keyboard. I went to the web app and the screen will rotate there but the text I type does not show up until after I click the save button on the entry. Edit to add: I just dowloaded the app on a second tablet, the screen will rotate to horizontal but when I click to start a new journal entry, it freezes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Difficult to cancel membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a good and simple app for journal writing. One very annoying thing though is the constant pop-ups to buy the premium version. Deducting two stars for that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love being able to keep a virtual diary, with pictures! I've had this for years. Highly recommend for someone looking for something similar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love it but my boyfriend ended up getting into the phone app and cloud app using my Google account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app's amazing. Simple user interface, love the pretty blue too. And it's free :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a nice journal to write in. The night mode is great. I really enjoy it because it shows you all your posts throughout the years. It shows you the place, the weather and temperature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been writing in this stupid thing for years. All of my entries disappeared and my account got wiped. This is horrible. I hate this app. Stick to orange diary. I am so sad about losing so many years of writings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been a user since 2018 love my journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really nice to have a secure journal on the go. Also aesthetically pleasing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I dislike management look of the position of words, needs better scroll down ability"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The new update doesn't allow for changes to be made when it comes to changing a username. I have down graded my review from 4 stars to 1 star because of it. App has been updated. 🎉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really frustrated with constant subscription prompts every time i post or edit a post"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, but should add more free features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been four years. I like that I can write anywhere when the mood strikes. This digital Journaling compliments my manual journal writings. Beneficial, soothing and helpful to cope with Life's challenges at unexpected momentz"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to document stages of life without using social media"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until they removed the feature to see past entries. Some of us aren't in a position where we can spend money like that. Extremely disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey for a few years now and I have really enjoyed the ability to journal right on my phone with an easy interface. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't write anything since past few weeks. Uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful to me and I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"oks lang po"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have this app installed on my macbook and phone. I've been writing on both devices ever since. Just recently, I used my macbook to write a very long journal and when I tried to read it again using my phone, the date was there but it's just blank. I synced it several times but still got nothing. Good thing I was able to copy and paste everything I wrote on that day to a different app and retrieve them. Hope you can fix this issue thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! The option to write, record, or do a voice clip is super convenient for my lifestyle and really helps make Journaling easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and on multiple devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good. HKD780 life-time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for many years and found it easy to use and when issues have arisen the Journey staff have been quick to respond and resolve them. I have tried other journal apps and by far Journey is the easiest to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that when I switched phones, it kept everything, worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"10/10 recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Minus the constant pop-up ads, this is a great app to track your personal thoughts, etc. Your journey is what you brought you here, so why not use a reliable, user-friendly app as way to cherish the memories and track your own personal growth. Btw, I have app tracking protection through duck duck go and why are you allowing 3rd party companies the ability to track and/or possibly hack the app/device we as consumers use in trying to maintain sanity by keeping a PERSONAL journal?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome journal app. Great to have on hand when needed! Really helps building a habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. It's very easy to use and keeping track of things is now fun. While I would like to give the app 5* for all these, I know there are still room for improvements. One suggestion would be to add a function to include images in your entry. And not just as an attachment, but in the editor screen itself. So that you can view the image while reading your entry. :) Hopefully, that's possible. Still a great app either way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journaling app. Just a bit pricey. Still a 5 star cause it does what I want/need. 2 years on, it's still a good journaling app. Trying to decide whether to renew or not. Might move to MS One Note."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best App ever. Don't think twice. Just download it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Journey is good but I don't like the way they charged Rs 2500 for me for renewal while they are charging Rs 1500 to Rs 2000 from others"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Sadly I need to downgrade my review. I'm a premium app user who has been using the android app on my Chromebook for a while now. A nice small laptop with a keyboard to easily create entries. Recent updts have broken my ability to use this on this device. I've tried the uninstall, delete data & reinstall. Even though I'm a premium user I can't use my premium features on the Chrome browser without paying a monthly fee. I wonder if that's the motivation for breaking the app on the Chromebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Trial"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and works well. It has helped me develop the habit of journalling. I haven't explored all the features yet but I am loving using it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is amazing, I can litterly look back 5 months from now and see how time goes on weather it's going bad, or really good so I like looking back on my back dates 💜❤🖤💨"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this almost 2 years, using it sporadically. Journaling is a habit I am desperate to develop for my personal and professional reflections. The last few months I have really started to make use of the coaching tools, they give great concise tips. I left very briefly the other day to see other apps, I quickly returned. This offers a unique simple recording tool that helps you focus on the core purpose of journals Highly recommended, give it a go!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No way to print...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Convenient and easy way to capture your inner thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It should sync with the web-based one, shouldn't it? Feel like a trap, honestly. Also difficult to make a refund. Not recommended at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app to take my Bible notes from church. It helps me keep everything together so I dont lose them or risk my notebook getting ruined. This is also a green way of keeping notes and saving the added use of paper. I love that I can attach photos and tag the notes based on church, prayers, bible studies, etc. This app is truly amazing and I've had no issus while using it. Very user friendly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this app on an almost daily basis as sort of a growth picture diary of my son. It's been great so far, my only complaint would be that I can't scroll through pictures on individual days unless I click on the day and then the pictures, sometimes I don't need to read the entry but just want to browse the photo. It would also be nice to not have premium ads thrown in my face whenever I log in, but I still enjoy using the app regularly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journaling your life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely worth the subscription. I love the tagging feature which has all kinds of helpful implications for work and health tracking. Also love seeing highlights from one year ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All I could hope for terrific app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using Journey for close to two years and I really enjoy the app. I love being able to add photos to entries and being able to access them cross platform. Being a digital storage for my journal entries I can only hope they are safe and secure for the foreseeable future to come. That's my only worry when I was making the switch from handwritten to digital journalling. That ten years from now, will I still have access to my writing?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just started using and so far looks good. I like you can embed pictures and files."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app ever. I've tried different ones, there would always be some issues. No more problems since I started using Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The Old problem of the font being too small in editing mode has been resolved since I last posted a review. Much easier to use now. It still pesters you to upgrade, but I'm happy with the features in the basic version, and not interested in all the social media etc addons"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is really nice to know what going on"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved using this app, but there is no way to change the name on your account, which is a feature that basically every other account based app has. This is a dealbreaker for me as I'm trans and it sort of defeats the purpose of a journaling app if I'm greeted with ""Hi, [deadname]"" every time I open the app. I was a paid subscriber for like 3 years but I will be cancelling my subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Chunks of data are missing from past entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great journal. I like the membership and have been quite pleased with it. Im digging it😛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing! I tried to sync by logging in and it deleted all my entries. When I logget out none of it was still recovered. I tried contacting on helpline but there's no response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Memories ..are ...there ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Absolutely my favorite app! Please Help! 1. My data isn't importing from exported zip. 2. My Journey content isn't available on other devices with the same account. 3. Does ""publish"" make My content accessible to Anyone/Everyone/Who I choose? 4. Can you make a way to push data to sync to Google Drive before I have to Uninstall the app when I forget my pin number?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I've always found it hard to keep a physical journal but this makes it so easy and I love being able to attach pictures and videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this journal for 2 years. Love the ability to add multiple photos as well as include links to online photo albums for significant events. Great tool for family history journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love your app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app since 2017. A great way for me to stay on top of Journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just started this and I really find this app easy to use it helps me tremendously"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm happy I get to record quickly, especially when I get random ideas for poems and drawing. Keep up the good work! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can't rename tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does it job very decently and make my life a bit better. Thanks for that!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"AVOID this app and company at all costs. They are a bunch of unhelpful and greedy people. I purchased the wrong app, and they demanded that I PAY DOUBLE to get the other version, and they refused to refund my first purchase, even when I told them immediately after it happened The app might fit your needs, but there are several other good apps with better customer service. The fact that they refuse to refund people at all costs just explains how they operate, no matter how they try to justify it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good user interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not a bad app except it deleted my intire paragraph"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for almost 3 years now and I like the fact that you can upload not just images but also videos. When I encountered a small issue in the app I immediately contacted the support team and they were so helpful, guiding me on what to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good as the saying goes. Still feeling my way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've used journey for over 4 years and I've generally enjoyed my experience. There are a few missing photos, but it's hard to say for sure if that is the apps fault or mine. Although you have to buy the upgrade, being able to export your whole journal is great so that I don't have to worry about losing years of entries. One suggestion that I've made and was told would be implemented but hasn't yet, is the ability to change my name in the app as I no longer use the name I signed up with."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Confusing pricing, different prices mentioned in 3 different places. 3.99 per month, 18.98 per month, 4.29 per month (???). The special discount dialog appears before you even use the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this several times a day. Very good! Update 3/14/22 - bought new phone & had to factory reset my old phone. When I first downloaded the app in my phones, it wasn't syncing or adding my old entries. Contacted cust svc. They were so helpful, great! Got both phones up & running. Love, love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Annoying pop ups and nfotifications every day about premium. Its forcing me to uninstall a good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Doesn't support s pen. But app is wonderful non the less"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good but not much colour"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I got a new phone the other day and opened this app up. Almost 2 years of entries are now gone. I've linked accounts and still nothing. Please, someone tell me if there is a way to get my entries back, because I could really use them right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! The journal prompts are a gentle way of making me check in everyday!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling never ""stuck"" until now. Easy & convenient to have it available on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No problems with this app for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"To catalogue the years happenings with added photos, and now to be able to look back on the years before is so useful. With this it is easy to see the changes, blessings and growth. I have kept journals for 50 years, but the past 6 years with this app have been so marvelous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It can't keep up with the videos, you will run out of storage as soon as you try to upload videos, guys you really should stream videos rather than keep all the data. Even that can be done better, currently you can't sync new videos until all the data is on your phone, my phone doesn't have that space. Guys you should really try a Spotify approach here, stream videos and sync text, and make it an option to download certain media or not at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for smartwatch."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fatanastic app. Heavens bless the day I discovered it. Been stuck with it ever since."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Updated Review 3/11/2022: Customer service was prompt and helpful for my issue. 🙏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 I realized that data intensive entries - e.g. those with lots of texts and photos within the body of the entry itself are a no-go. However, if there's one area of focus devs should work on.. is sync, especially for data-intensive entries. If we can get that up, I pledge to adjust to stars. In the meantime, I'll use the web app as a main point of contact. Thanks for the app. Improvements needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over a year. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really love this app!!💚 such a great way to keep a journal and adventures!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"2.5/10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is very engaging for we can keep our special memories here but I only rated 4 stars instead of 5 for the reason that I can't access all the option button because we have to pay for an exact amount for updating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not showing my old entries where to check for them ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Customer support really cared for my problem and helped me resolve my problem. Thanks a lot ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Little to no ads. That's what I like about it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't cancel my subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it as a diary and it is so fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best thing I've used where I can save memories 🙀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have used this to enter an my weight loss journey which is good to look back on and see what I have actually eaten for that day or lost in that week this is a great app for that thoroughly recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Upgraded to premium - very good product - easy to use - good value"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple & beautiful experience + sustainable backup. Has some glitches but forgivable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app and wonderful free experience, it lets me stay connected and safe with their password system, and I can seamlessly sync between my computer and phone so I never miss an opportunity to write down how I'm feeling 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Operation is easy . Design is clean and organized. I love that you can back up your writings so not to loose anything ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just an excellent way of writing your diary and keeping or thoughts recorded. #tag"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I bought the lifetime membership because I feel comfortable to write in this app. I used to use book as diary for years. I think this app would be great if it adds features which make user possible to draw or handwriting on the daily page. The combination of typing and drawing or doodling could make diary become more personal and memorable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, all I needed was a place to jot down experiences when I felt like it and added photos when I wanted, nothing fancy just easy to use, practical."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app.. simple yet comprehensive.. would like to see a feature upgrade soon which allows multiple photos selection from google photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, easy to use across devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: The response to this review is a lie. The problem was not fixed. It happened again today. DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP, it's basically fraudulent. There is no clear way to delete your membership, so I'm 100% confident these fraudsters will try to bill me again in a year. Avoid this app. DO NOT pay for it until you've used it thoroughly. On my 3rd post the web app wouldn't save, giving me an error message. I couldn't copy the text as I could tell it would be lost. After a few frozen minutes, I refreshed the web app and the text was lost. Customer support did all they could to rule it user error (it was not), then said they couldn't give a refund but they're working on a fix for the future. If a morning of frustration and condescension is ur idea of serenity, you'll love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant wee app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works! Update: I installed this app and reviewed it in May 2021. I have been using it for a while and I really like it. It helps me to write about my experiences and feelings and to understand what goes on in my mind on a daily basis. It is a great app and I recommend it. Even the free version is great and as I said before it works very well. It is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary app. no ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Add free for now. No complaints at all. I just wish i remembered to use it every day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent place to journal. Very simple and very real like you're writing your own thoughts. I've enjoyed it for 2 years now and don't plan on getting rid of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for the fact that it's simple if you wanna use it simple and it's not if you want extra features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All me past recordings were deleted. I had 2 years of recordings that were very important to me lost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoyable App, full of many extras to keep an accurate account of daily life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journey app ever thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, simple and straight forward. Web interface and app interface is easy to navigate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Favorite App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this it also reminds me to journal too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My go to diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this it makes my writing simple and pretty"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary. Good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm enjoying the app. I wish there was a way to edit the order of photos and rotate them instead of having to add each photo individual to get the order correct."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good, especially when you can buy the permanent subscribtion on sale"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to subscribe to see my own entries from a couple of years ago. It feels like my very own thoughts are being held at ransom. Not cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Ugly as sin, have to pay for any additional features (themes, fonts, etc) just to be usable and not ugly. Response to developer: You've made something purposefully unpleasant and ugly to force people to pay. Yeeeeah, no."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A user of this app for 2 years and counting and I'm still loving it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the free version and it has plenty of great features and there's nothing annoying about it. I love that you can add pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Reduced to 2 due to constant nagging to buy a premium subscription after already purchasing a Lifetime Premium Licence. No way to cancel despite the claim that if ""Special offer"" was rejected that it would not be offered again. It still popped up every day for about a week and had to be manually cleared each time before I could even access Journey. A request for assistance on the help chat resulted in an email that they would contact me shortly. After 8 days still no reply. Good app gone bad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing. So clean and intuitive. I'm hooked!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Why I can't sync to cloud? It's said net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. Please advice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, going on three years now using it. And it's getting better. Documenting my journey is wonderful. ""To live is to evolve."""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Would get 5 if it offered the three most basic BuJo glyphs for task, event, note. For the last, i have Japanese long katakana vowel glyph as ー Some android keybd have the glyphs — and → and ✓."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I write everything I go through. Helps me to lessen my pain . My best therapist it is lol."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use, makes jounaling on the go super easy and well organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Love the idea. Very disappointed in the thumbnail version of photos. I can not figure out a way to adjust the crop. If this is fixed or I am just simply missing this feature I would gladly change my review to 5 stars. EDIT TO ONE STAR Been using this app for years. Haven't logged in a little while. Now I can't see my past entries unless I pay the subscription. On principle alone. This app will NEVER get my money now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I just relogged into the app and was really dissapinted to see that I lost a load of old memories going back two years. How can I rectify this?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Irritating high pressure sales tactics. First login, before you've even looked at the app, tries to get you to pay for a year up front, and you have 60 seconds to accept. Guess what? Even if I'd wanted to, I don't have the money to spare at this instant. Probably will in a few days, but oh well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a single mom of 8 struggling and this helps me just take a few moments and get my feelings out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app helps me express myself and write down my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for about 2 years and have paid for the Premium version - need I say more? Alright then! I just spent 6 days in hospital with a minor perforation of my appendix. I used the app to document my stay as well as my recovery after discharge. The app automatically inserts the address at which you make your entry, and invites you to indicate your mood on a 5-point scale. Paragraph and font formatting are also included. There's lots more - well worth a look. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I think its disgraceful that I'm not allowed a refund for forgetting to cancel my subscription renewel - the day of. I am a struggling student and now one mistake is the difference between having enough money for the week or not. Disgusting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No issues"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"With less than a week of experience, I am still learning, but have found Journey to be easy to use and very capable in terms of keeping a record of my travel and life. I especially like the Atlas feature and the way it incorporates my photos onto a world map. Also, I like that I can import my Google Fit data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why oh why as a Premium member am I getting pop ups to upgrade, it so very annoying and I will not upgrade. Please remove this horrible feature for Premium members."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please dont spam me to buy the membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience with the journey has been a great one . And I intend to keep it going ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a couple of years. The customer support is great. When I encountered a small issue in the app when I updated it to version 4.1 I can't input an entries so Immediately contacted the support team. They guide me on what to do. And luckily the app works again. Rating this app is another way of saying thank you. Keep it up developer!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for more than a year and have previously had a really good experience. A few months ago, I noticed that there are now glitches that were never there before. One: limiting the amount of text that can be copied within the note editor at once. Another glitch involves backspacing and starting a new paragraph, which somehow ends up duplicating the paragraph instead. It's little glitches like this that make the user experience really annoying, esp on a premium account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This was way disappointing what you can use without joining. Even more disgusting is that there are a bunch tool that look active, but they only send you to the join up page. Making this impractical to use. From my point of view, I need a few weeks to feel out the app and the logic behind its usefulness. Three days is crazy short, even more so for an app that is for habits. I kind like a few things, but the main things like the tracker are unusable in the free download."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app - i use it on both IOS and android simultaniously with no problems."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely marvelous app. I have used it for 5 years and love getting the daily links to what I wrote on the day 5 years ago, 4,3,2, and last month. I find joy in the memories as well as forgotten wisdom."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Constant notifications to get you to subscribe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I enjoy using the voice recorder for logging in journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a virtual diary! Very cool!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I prefer the old ""today"" tab. Current ""Stories"" look more eye catching and looks great, however I still prefer the old ""today"" because it's much faster to take a peek and select which journal that I want to read further. Unlike now that I should read my old journal ONE BY ONE. Yeah, I can tap to preview, but still a hassle for me. 4 Star because of this, sorry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app in my opinion!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Misleading subscription model. They got my money for a lifetime subscription, but then they did a bait and switch on me. I've already sent them numerous emails outlining this and they deny any wrongdoing. Unethical double-grab for money. Re: app creator's response below - I've already been told three times by your 'help' department (Ellen, Jeromy and unnamed employee) that they won't do anything for me. I've given up on getting my $59.98 back. I want to save other people from getting overcharged"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Great for looking back on records I've made and photos added at the time!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Feb 2022 : Developers, what have you done?! I have been happily using Journey premium for years (I gave 5 stars in 2018), but now suddenly the font has become all compressed, and compiling and editing has become difficult, with the screen view always whizzing up to the top and not to the cursor entry point. Please revert back to how it was a few weeks back. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Was using the app quite happily since 2018 so paid for Lifetime Premium. All was well until I bought new phone and had to sync. My app says lifetime but the cloud says not, and ads keep asking me to pay, while furthermore has synced to wrong Google drive. I am being told to delete and re- install. Thus losing all my journal?? Update...I sorted this out myself by saving and downloading my info which I then laboriously re-entered by copy and paste. All syncs to correct drive now and fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for over 3years and its been nothing short of amazing!!! Way to go. 👏👏👏 I still love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using the Journey Journal app for about a year. Although there is a paid membership which I had a year subscription for, there is nothing wrong with the free version! I can keep my thoughts in a secure place and even lock it as well. I have the ability to share my entries which is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used Journey for several years and find it easy to use with no technical difficulties. It's an awesome journaling tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal app to store memories. My late grandma and dog's pics/vids are stored here. Responsive customer service too. Hoping they'd be here for a long time to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I want to cancel my monthly Billing but the app doesn't give me the opportunity to. I don't want a refund, I just want to cancel my subscription so that I won't be billed the next month."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It makes keeping up with journaling every day so much easier tof someone with a tight schedule like me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great as a substitute for a physical journal. It is easy to use and seamless. I can just use my Google drive account to save all of my journal entries. It is an overall convenient app for organizing your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best thing that has happened to me. Since getting this journal I have not skipped much days of journaling, I have such a great realtionship with it. And the user experience is magnificent!! Thank you for this great app. I love it! Good job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"was supposed to only pay 60% of yearly fee for the year but ended up paying the full amount."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the layout of the app I liked it it doesn't bother me too much I liked it it was free I like how well the speak to text translation works my only reservation is that I just don't like the write things down because everything you say can and will maybe held against you, not really. 🤦"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The auto renew feature does not remind you before renewing and they will not refund your purchase. There is no excuse not to send you a reminder email except to hope you forget so they get money. Scummy behavior."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app, I like that it's free too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No auto saving of notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not going to agree to a 3-day trial period followed by am auto-triggered unless you cancel through the Play Store $40+/yr subscription. Let me try the app first but feel free to remove any of the features that you believe are worth $40+/yr unless I agree to a subscription. I'm not going to agree to yet another subscription that I may forget about due to $life and the app'a relatively small per month sum without knowing that the app offers some worth to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good stuff so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"아침부터 저녁까지 일상을 스케치 하듯 기록하고, 사진도 몇 장 올려 놓으니 일기장도 되고 추억도 되고. 여러 디바이스에서 같이 사용도 가능하니 너무 좋습니다."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely phenomenal. The flow of the app is great! The movement is flawless, and I really mean it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and works across platforms."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I've been looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app to keep stuff together"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how, i can have this Uninstalled for a year, re-download and log in, and everything is still there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, been using it for years and it's great getting reminders of throwback entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app. Been using it for years. I am ready to pay but subscription cost high for india market. I can pay if its 1$ monthly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly. The tags are great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is awesome and the mobile app makes journalling easy. I'm a happy paying customer and don't have any plans of changing that soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is a good app. ive been looking for an app where i can keep my thoughts and feelings that was also easy to use. Recent update...there was a android update and now it doesn't hardly work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I like the added security in the app needing a password. Keeps my diary private!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A stable and functional dairy app, hope it could accept to add more videos in one entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Oh Journey! What happened? Your recent update completely wrecked my Android's editing environment. Please help with an update soon!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love that I can use it with my S-pen, since I have painful arthritis on both my hands, which has put a damper on my love for journaling and manual activities in general. However, having a paid version, I would expect to have more personalization options, like script & other types of fonts, as well as different choices for the type & colors of writing ""paper."""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It should be available for free to users besides premium subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've had the app for about a good week now, and I like to copy and paste articles and all that I read on the web to a note so I can read it offline, and I've copied and pasted a few notes already. The problem is that when I went to add something in yesterday, I went back to the previous note and saw that all of the spaces between the paragraphs had been taken out. Like, no spacing between the paragraphs anymore. It's frustrating because I specifically got the app to read the notes I make offline"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app itself is OK, but there's constant (multiple times on each usage) pestering for payment of an outrageous subscription. Additionally, the app constantly bugs you to leave a rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this so far! Password protected. Can add pics or video. Hash tags available! Great app HOWEVER, it looks like they've removed the mood tracker! I loved that feature 😢"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"hopefully you will have the handwriting mode conver to text"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why bother trying it when it's only free for 3 days ☹️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good to record our daily life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"How to import from Diarium?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for writing. Best privacy policy. I like the app very much. I have stopped writing bcz pening down on paper is difficult nowadays bcz we use phone and we chat. So writing everything here is the best experience. Infact we can pin over images too. So I am enjoying using the app. U must also try if want to write and want a better experience. 😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This journal app is very flexible and offers at it's core a very simple journaling experience with the options to add entries via email. The mood tracker, weather, location and activity also enhance entries with more context. There are plenty of views such as map, calendar, timeline, throwback and media to keep you engaged. Text input seems awkward on the latest update and Google Fit integration has been removed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Most amazing and best app for journalling. The app is feature-rich and has a very intuitive UI. Every feature works perfectly and I never found a single bug. Definitely worth trying. I really never care about reviewing apps but this one made me. I really want to support this application but the yearly subscription fee is really high for me. Some day, probably in some way. Or perhaps the devs can find some other way so customers can support! Cheers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app and really easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really easy way to jot down my thoughts and keep a personal book of Rememberance"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, lot of studies shows Journal keeping is one of the best hobbies and this app is No.1 if you want to keep your journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this journal for a bit but recently decided to upgrade and use it more frequently. I truly enjoy it. I like the ability to sync across my devices and edit from my phone, tablet, or laptop. I also enjoy the occasional flashbacks on previous entries. I think this app is special! Kudos to the developers!! Thank you so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I just love that it attaches to your g-account so all your previous entries won't be lost. *************UPDATE********************** WOW 😳 now I have to pay to see my previous entries! Yeah ok!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its so easy to use ,exactly what i wanted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is definitely one of my favorite applications. I highly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"pay to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app - please keep innovating!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hard to use I wasn't impressed there must be better apps out there then this, I understood as I was charged monthly I was charged for a year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best app that helps you register notes, journal, keep ideas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have my memories on an app and on online, I love this digital journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Sometimes The ads bug me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Long time diary person. Like this one. Premium worth the $$. Can't export because of some file sharing BS. Looking for another app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app regularly for a month, a reminder on a night. I mainly use to put down my thoughts/feelings for the day so that I don't carry them through the night when I need to sleep. I've used it for ticking off daily tasks/goals. You can add photos too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This has been a great journey for me and this is a great place to write about it in. Tried them all and so far this one's got my vote!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great daily journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I like the fact that I can create a backup in the cloud and can use on multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free at all too expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful app. I like the fact that I can journal using voice to text so I can just think and dictate my thoughts. The interface is pretty good overall with a good search ability and the ability for tags. Although I seem to forget to take things often, so it is not as useful as it could be. I started journaling during the lockdown and it has really helped me find a place to release my thoughts. I highly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice to have"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just what I wanted a simple blank page for daily notes. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to add pictures, quotes , Facebook posts, & insights directly into my thoughts for the day. Love the calendar that allows me to go to any date and add something I missed entering. Love the search capability. Especially like the automatic sync across devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"There's a bug. If you are writing an entry on the daily journal prompts and accidently click outside the text box, the ""story"" starts to time out behind what your typing. If you click ""done"" it closes the window but your entry is gone. ___ For the record I actually really like this app so far but I wanted to try it out for a month before writing a review. I just wanted to report this bug because I lost a long entry. I know it's an edge case but I can't be the only one to fat-finger my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me stay grounded and keep mind more positive in these tough times. Seriously! There's much to benefit using this app in this new world we're living in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. Easy to use and secure enough to keep out even the most inquisitive of Hobbits. Edit: 4 years later, this app has been my daily companion and a true joy to use. My thoughts and ideas are always accessible and safely kept in one place. The throwbacks are great to let me see how I've changed and grown over the years, how differently I think and to reflect on the events that changed me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have just discovered that the app has locked the ability to see my old entries unless I upgrade to premium. No warning about this was given!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use, great interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Guys, I love your app so much, but it does not allow me to add photos and videos in the same story; Please, guys, at least give us the opportunity to add one video and 5 (or more) pictures together in the same story 🙁. That is everything I ask for! 🙏 I won't change my rating otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hehe never got to use it ""not everything is free""😅"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good but not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I strongly recommend this to everyone that is interested in self-betterment. Its also a great app for just journalling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Overall I like the app and what it does. I have been using it for about 3 years now. What I dont like is paying for the subscription for my Android Phone and then ANOTHER subscription to use the web version - Journey.cloud For what the subscription costs you would think they would let you use the browser version as well, but nope. Separate cost. I used to love journey, but now they are just plain greedy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. Worth the subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had no issues. Great journal tool. Love reading past entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find comfort from the app. It's definitely something I use to help me grow and it's a tool for self love."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Well made but way too many ads, it takes longer to watch the ads then to write the diary entry ^^"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what is says and does it well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing journal app but am having trouble subscribing for premium. It can't accept my credit cards. 🥲"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app l."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Love the app but customer service literally stopped responding to me. And I had a normal case where I was just asking them to refund me for double charging me (it was a problem on their side). I tried for literally over a month to contact them, over 7 separate times. This is what it comes to now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Just always asks for you to go premium. Other than that, I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lost all my entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for almost 6 years and counting ❤❤ I was someone who don't open up to people in my teenage years but I have this and it helped my mind not to explode with unnecessary thoughts 😅 So thankful for this. I also love the new features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you don't want to share your thoughts with anybody but yourself. Journey diary can help you unload those words from your mind you want to say, and you can come back on the future to compare where you were standing in the past and what you accomplished since then. The best journal app that I have found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Able to notate daily wins"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, nice interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for years. I love the throwbacks it shows me from 4 years ago, last year, or 30 days ago. I can see the growth, setbacks, and all the things I've seen and heard over the years. I love the format. The help desk has always been responsive and so helpful. I use the app and web version on all of my devices. I'm thankful I found this app. Everything about it was made for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a good app for journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Convenient also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Amazing app! You just cannot paste things from your keyboard or cannot add pictures on the page, that's all!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app! The best in my opinion, its so easy and motivating to use. Also great customer support, I hope the app can add paypal as a possible payment option in the near future as I do not have a credit card :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"To good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app with good support I recently had to change my linked account and support made it super easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"برنامج جميل وبسيط"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"How do.i reset password, i forgot it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just so great , using it from 2018 and all I can say this app is almost flawless no interrupting ad , easily used and well organized. I can recap back my lost memories before:))"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have known this app for years, I have used it many times and deleted it, but this is the year where I have actually considered it to be my lifetime journal. I loved the way that you can do a lot on it's free version. Great job! I will definitely treasure this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good and nice app to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it'd be a five star if not for that many Ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My faithful companion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent product"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a perfect way for us to write my thoughts and attaching the pictures and memories you have saved. Thank you big time for the developer who did this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like how simple it is to use, the password protection as well. Better than a physical journal that can be opened by anyone. I have only been using it for a month, so I will most probably come back to edit this post."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. Easy to Use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for me . Than you . Developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, great for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used Journey off and on for a long time. I love the simple but feature-filled text editor, how you can attach files, the layout and UI, and the fact that you can export your entries in different formats. But what I love more than anything else is that you can buy a lifetime version of the pro membership. Any good software that isn't going to force me to pay them every month for the rest of my life is gold in my book. The price is worth it. The free version is decent too, so try that first"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Awesome features. App is excellent both as free and paid. Runs smoothly. Great as a prayer and graititude journal. Well done, creators"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It keeps on force closing fix this please."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Chose this for several reasons but the main allure was ""free"". Please do not say that your app is free if it clearly is not free. Thanks. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Holding my journal entries hostage for a subscription price. Not cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works. Wish it was free with ads tho."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using for years. Some times it pesters me to upgrade but I don't. It's cloud storage has stuff from more than 3 relationships ago and poetry dating to times significantly different than now. It's quite nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app should have the option to change appearance to look masculine. Otherwise, it's a good journaling app and expensive. I would buy if lifetime price was 4 - 5k Rupees. 8k is not worth the investment. I'd rather buy a journaling book which can have better impact on my mental health."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great app, but somehow lost all of my journal entries after I tried to back them up to the cloud. Bummer. Is there any way to get them back?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I need an app that will rotate with the tablet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The latest update made it lag for me. Please fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ery handy app I use the free version and you can put a password on it to keep it private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app for keeping track of daily stuff and making suggestions for healthy mind reading"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and simple. Just what I need. There are premium subscriptions, but I'm just getting back into journaling so I don't feel the need to purchase yet. If you are an avid journalist this might be for you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the journal that I've needed. I've always thought that Journaling in general would be good for my mental health. But I could never stick with Journaling with a book and pen. This app is so visually appealing and easy to use. Whenever I need to vent to think over something, I just open the app and I start typing. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Simple to use and simple design."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Adds are predatory, my 50% deal has a one minute countdown..... gtf outta here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love the App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has allowed me to be myself and express who I am without discomfort definitely an amazing app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app. Simple, clean, and the daily reminder to journal is very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So very easy to use. I use the app for many things, a to do list ,gratitude list, grocery list, tracking purchase and meals. Could not live with out it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome journal. So many great features. Love that I can put my photos in. It also gives you a ""look back"" which is great since I've been using it for over 3 years. Also, you can access the your entries from multiple places. And best of all, as I just discovered, when you change/ update your phone, it can just download all your previous entries!! Other features:You can also export them to other places. There are prompts available, a mood tracker and so much more. Love, Love , Love this app.💗💗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I liked the app but it kicked me out while writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really like it but needs a speel check feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app, makes journaling easy, enjoyable and organised. One of the best features is the cloud synch. I can yes my tablet, laptop is phone, and they all synch :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Fine. You want to pester me for a review? You get 3 stars. It's a decent app but I'm still learning how to use it, I haven't formed a full opinion yet. So here you go, it's ok."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I love that you can attach a few pictures to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for years. Works well. Good backup."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Is this free or free only during trial?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best and Easy to capture important events in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Won't let me export without joining."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Except the constant reminders that you could be spending money with them, this app is very good at recording your daily journey, for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Top app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I was looking for a very simple journaling app and this is it. I don't have the premium, so I can't comment on that, but I can comment on the regular. I love the passcode option. I also love that I can use it on my computer. Sometimes when I have a lot to write, I prefer to use a real key board. Anyone who is on the fence should download this app and at least give it a try. Highly recommend this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Work's great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks for this wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just so grateful for the free free app I use it to journal everyday in 2022."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can focus on what matters, see how I am changing, & learn wisdom from my own unfolding story. Have used for years; love it. Got in early (lifetime membership), but husband just purchased subscription (seeing the value for the price). Like how I can tag. Searching could improve. I have been using symbols for the things I journal in a day to visually organize what I'm writing. 🔥- my time in God's word 🔰-things I'm learning 👍-good things to be encouraged by."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Better than penzu."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"404. That’s an error. The requested URL was not found on this server. That’s all we know."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a great app for recording my thoughts. I like the guided writing. I'm still pretty disappointed that you can't have separate journals. I don't want my coached writing sessions mixed in with my food journal, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean and functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesomr"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best application to express oue feelings especially when you are alone right now and no one to talk to. 5 stars for you Developer, nice friendly interface, I wish I was a good app developer like you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really simple to use, and the experience is so cool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using the Journey app for just about everything!! I have even started cataloging very important items such as jewelry that I get (mainly from my husband). It's nice to be able to look back and see why I received it and when. Hopefully, it will help my girls when I'm gone!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Showing sync errors ..all my entries are not accessible"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app and good customer support as well. Everything just works as intended. Do Recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Doesn't remember What I wr6"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Miserable app & user experience. Deceitful company, awful, use anything or anyone else. I stopped using Journey 1 month in after purchasing an annual subscription, and when my subscription auto-renewed (because they make it nearly-impossible to find a place to cancel your subscription), I reached out to the company within 30 minutes of auto-renewal to ask for a refund because I didn't want to continue using the service. They told me to pound sand and they'll never give a dollar back. They're bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It won't download. It just keeps pending"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal app is easy to use and easy to search my previous journals by key words or tag, love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good jounal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app on and off for about 4 or 5 years now. It's interesting to see how much I've changed and to see how much I haven't. I love that the app is available offline so when I have quiet time like on a plane or something I can just journal... The ads can be a little annoying but once you buy into it it's really nice 👍🏽❤️ I almost feel like this app has grown up with me into adulthood"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Day 2 with Journey. Did a coach challenge. Answered 1st question yesterday. All ok. Answered 2nd question today. Write a fair amount. Clicked done. Did not save it. NOT GOOD!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Need a paid membership to backup"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have faced no problem while using this app so far. The sync works fine too. The synchronize feature really helpful as I'm using this apps to wirte down my mental illness symptoms (I would be forgetful most of the time)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The bug got resolved, I forgot I left the review until coming to rate it again. A few years on now and I'm still using Journey on and off. It's the one journaling app I always return to. The ability to import from other apps, like Daylio, is a HUGE feature for me, as I struggle to stay with a single app all the time. The option to buy licenses is also wonderful, as I hate subscription services."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Never had so much trouble trying to cancel a subscription in all my life.. you guys are robbers...!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not bother with this app. You can unsubscribe but you do not get a receipt when you cancel, so there is no confirmation of your action to unsubscribe. So it will be your word against theirs if you forget and are charged again. This app does not inspire trust. See ya!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍 I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Osm"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to keep a digital diary. Always handy to jot stuff down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for whole year after trying so many apps, finally choosing to buy the premium lifetime plan bc of how satisfied I am with the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App keeps advertising even with the paid version. If I want to review the app I will."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Had forever..tried others but this is the one that I found best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great!! I can type my reflections and even attach pics to go with the context"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app and I subscribed right away. I have a feedback regarding the line height, it would he better and easy to read if you give us options to configure the line heights such as 1, 1.5, 2, and so on. I hope you add this function soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"เรียบง่าย ใช้งานได้เรื่อยๆ มินิมอลสุด"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Never kept s Journal until I found it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"4 years enjoying the app. Have not lost an entry not even once"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, uncluttered layout."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When you're looking for an diary app thats just work & good user experience, this is it. just dont forget to sync with google drive, i have change 3 phones and all have smooth transition between phones, no missing journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have just downloaded the free version and so far it seems great. One question I have is about the export feature. I'd like to know more before I buy the paid version of the app. The main thing I'd like to do is export my entries and photos to print an annual yearbook. Do you have an example of what the PDF would look like (layout) of a diary entry, and a few pictures (e.g. 400 words and 3 photos). Is there an email address i can contact? Many thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for years now. The UI is super easy to use. Love the look of the interface. I'm using it as my primary diary app. This app has been awesome from day one. Best diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've only been using it for one day, but I'm using it to keep track of my time, meals and all my daily activities. At this point, it has been pretty intuitive and easy to use. I'm still unclear what the advantage is to subscribe, but I decided to subscribe for a year since it was such a significant discount."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Too many prompts to upgrade. I'm okay with the free version for now. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible. I used this app as a free app 6+ years ago, and just now noticed a fraudulant charge billing me $29.99 a year for the last two years. Absolutely despicable and completely unauthorized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app for Journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Edit: this is useless if you want to use more than one device. I have always gotten an error message when trying to sync. Great little app but I wish I could add more photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"😊😊😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this journaling app. Easy-to-use, I only wish that they didn't have some of the editing features behind a paywall, such as bullet points."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great always liked this very useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Android app is great, but when I use the web/desktop version it keeps asking me to upgrade to a membership even though I already have one? I am using the same log in but for some reason the desktop version thinks I have a free account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There is just ad of this app, there is no the other product's ad. It is the best point for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It could have been better if the app allows both video and up to 5 photos per post"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally found a really solid replacement for Day One, which I'd used for years--and it was easy to transfer over the existing journal content. Journey app offers all the simplicity and security that I want in a journaling app, and it adds in the throwback features that are helpful for self-integration when you've got multiple months / years of content to reflect on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It feels like having a book where you can write anything on your mind! It offers privacy and you can back up your data and retrieve anytime you want.Looking forward to upgrading!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. 5 years and counting 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Omg! Easy to use, very simple and understandable, now i can text to yourself and think with by ""Journey"""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The free version of this app will totally suffice for most people's needs however I have become a fan of uploading multiple pictures to each post as well as changing the font color and size, so I upgraded the pro. Also I'm a huge fan of the location tagging and the hashtag feature. If you're looking for a solid journaling app that feels like something more than just a Google doc I would strongly recommend this app. Most people will probably get what they need from the free features 😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Solid but it has its problems. I enjoy the responsiveness and the overall UI. Writing feels fantastic, but for my model (Samsung tab S7+) the autocorrect does not work which is incredibly annoying. Tested it on my phone and there it works, so I have no idea what magic causes it to bug-out on the tablet. Otherwise, I think the price is fair, but locking basic functions like bold and itallic behind a subscription wall is kind of cheap..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's a great app. But you won't even let me indent a note without paying. That's just greedy and dumb."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything is good except Price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Very nice when it's working. But the sync to cloud using google drive function is fragile and buggy. I've had to spend way too much time troubleshooting sync errors and permission errors. Aggravating and tiresome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"journey is a great personal diary. very easy to use. it can add photos too. i never had any issues so far. by putting my days into the diary, i hope i can reflect back on myself one day. * by the way, any diary will will only be useful, if you update it regularly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for several years now. I use it to document personal event milestones, achievements and importantly my blood sugar readings. As a diabetic, it helps to record and monitor my progress especially when it shares posts from previous months and years. It's also very convenient to be able to attach photos. A good and useful app that's why I even opted to become a Premium user! An easy and wonderful way to save memories! 💛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great little diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing feature that lets you add documents and the documents are just as clear. Thank you for this feature, it has saved me long hours of copying words I could just copy and save forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helpful,but pricy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. Shady payment policies. They don't remind you that your subscription ends. They charge you automatically and don't refund!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Handy app for phone, would of been 5 stars if the app went horizontal along with my phone but it doesn't."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep you on track with writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for years now! Not much ads. It doesn't matter whether you change phones because it syncs everything with your email. I also have no issues with its features aside from the limitations of the free version (ofc!)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever. I've been using it for years and I love adding pictures to my entries and the throwbacks. My favorite feature is being able to search!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In free version more photos should be allowed to attach."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Thanks a lot. I don't like month charge. Why can't you charge 4.99 one time charge like everyone else?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What makes this app different to the others is you can geotag your journal to map. This app definitely great for exploring new areas. I am using the free version for now, though there are a lot limitation. Still very great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, much better than some others I was previously using. The other diary apps that I have used were either hard to use/weren't visually appealing or had way too many adds. This app is much better than any others I have tried. It looks great visually, doesn't bombard you with adds, has all the features you need, let's you add photos, and it does everything else I needed it to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I looove this app! New generation of diary that save the day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too many ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a great app for jotting down any ideas and thoughts you may have through out the day. Perfect for writers looking to stay or become organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I didn't really get a chance to try it before I was being asked to purchase a lifetime membership. I must've had at least one entry but when I selected the entry date to review it, it said that I needed to upgrade to pro to see it. 🤦🏽‍♀️ So I just deleted this app instead. 🤷🏽‍♀️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't export my notes it shows a red exclamation mark. I used to love this product for years but now it's just too pushy with subscriptions(my lifetime membership gets cut into something more restrictive every year) and not letting you even migrate data. I am manually copy pasting all my data because I can't support this app anymore. Support is also very unhelpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app💖 Keeps track of my thoughts, my moods, & my pictures 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this app daily! 😁 Nice Journal that is easy to use, .as well as, it has the capability to transfer your journal to a new device via Google."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An amazing app! Thank you sooooo much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely worth the subscription! I'm excited to one day print off my book of life..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never really had a problem with the app. It's working for me for the most part however I seldomly use it especially to it's full potential. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"They fixed the most recent problem. It's definitely worth the $. I gave the lifetime one and have been happy with it. It is a lot better than any of the other apps out there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good Application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of my thoughts no matter where I am without lugging out a paper journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I spent 20min writing something only to click the back arrow on my phone and have nothing saved!I tried writing a few words and pressing back to see if it erased it, and it didn't!! So it must've been a bug, but i still lost my work.i uninstalled,I decided to give it another try, thinking i had synced it to my Ggl acc, well of course it hadn't saved anything, even though I logged in. Also it has way too many ads for the premium, and no features for the free one,it's just a glorified notes app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app on my phone and desktop for four years. I love it, mostly. I wish I could edit my tags list (delete ones I created be accident) and wish there was a sequential calendar to ""add entry for the next day"" when adding as backlog of past entries chronicled elsewhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Subscription basis. Rs. 3300/- annually. Complex UI"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actually journal now. I write down all the funny stuff my kids do, and this app records it and even reminds me about it later. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"കിടിലൻ"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am using this for my loc journey and to save other photos very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great interface to spill out your own story"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Why can't I use the premium app on my laptop? I have the premium on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! However, I wish when I was copying things that I've written elsewhere that it didn't throw in the wors span throughout the entire thing. Very frustrating 2 have 2 carefully go thru the whole thing just so I can delete a word I did not put in there. Especially when it's there over 20+ times."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm having problems with my subscription. I was charged for one, but the app says I am on the free version even after relogging in again a few times. I've reached out via chat since Nov 29 21 and no on answers. I sent email to the chat email option over a week ago and no one has responded. I don't like complaining publicly in a review like this but I have no other way to reach anyone. EDIT: so I've been working with support since Nov 18 and I'm having no luck. They respond but the conversation goes no where. I've asked them to fix the subscription problem but they don't seem to understand what I'm asking. I think they think I did this to myself somehow and that I should be the one to fix it. I'm downgrading my initial review. Also while you can delete your entries, it doesn't look like you can cancel your account. You can cancel your subscription, delete your entries but your account will remain with them. Edit: reply to developer. Indeed. It was entirely my fault I'm sure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy and reliable journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"well thought out, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Backup must be free ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Actualizacion: si cargas videos se te queda el telefono sin espacio. Deberian permanecer en la nube hasta sean solicitados. Si no el archivo personal se vuelve gigante."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. I just downloaded it but like it so far. Does all that i need for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been about a month that I have been using this app. So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"നല്ല ആപ്ലിക്കേഷൻ"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps memories Alive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that I can track my journal entries with a calendar and how organized it is and also able to attach pictures with the journey as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"My phone updated to UI 12 today. Since the update I can't add any entries. The only thing that I can do, is to look at past entries. Do you have an update to make your software compatible with UI 12?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app and appreciate the fact that I can pour my heart out without any fear that someone may invade my privacy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Why is there happy and angry amd everything in between but no sad? Happy/angry is important but so is recording other emotions. Can we have the option to set the 5 emotes used? Especially premium users.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well designed and versatile app, can be synced accross all my devices , would recommend! Been using it for a while now and find it great for looking up past events in the family when reminiscing.🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is very good, but there is no features to make or import templates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used Journey for 2 years now, works great, absolutely reliable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Before the latest Android update, this app was awesome - now it adds blank lines between paragraphs to the point where an entry is unreadable. It's really frustrating because I use it daily. Edit: the fix that the help desk offered was to switch my keyboard to the Gboard. This solved the issue for my Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. Thanks Journey for the quick response and help!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is now December 3 2021. Very enjoyable and easy to use. Great integrations! It is now November 19th 2020 and this app is still incredibly useful I like it very much I wish I could be more consistent but it gives a good reminder everyday so good job I like it a lot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I was double charged and they don't respond at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How come Google security check-up suggests to remove your access? This being the case can't you just offer an option of using your own account to log in?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app, although I admit my needs are simple. I just wanted a secure journaling app that allows me to add photos to entries. It works perfectly for my needs. Updated 12/1/21: I have used Journey for the last two years and loved having a record of photos and memories. Then, when I noticed my Google Drive was getting full, I inadvertently deleted the app's ""hidden data"", which turned out to be all of my journal entries, which were backed up nowhere else. A cautionary tale for everybody!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use I like that you can attach photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful, applied this as my daily journal. It's like a dairy what u have to do what u havent done yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't recommend this app enough. I've been using it on and off for years, and recently got back into it - there are so many options available so you're not just limited to text, there's also voice, image and the one I use the most lately - is actually adding video entries. One of the very few journal apps that will allow me to do that and back up to the cloud (on the paid version). When social media is so prominent but you want to record something just for yourself and nobody else, this is the best solution for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my absolute favorite apps of ALL TIME! It is just perfect! Unlimited writing, unlimited diaries, tags, gorgeous and modern design, everything running smoothly, no crashes, no bugs, everything perfectly organised in a calendar for easy access (finding diary entries is so easy), cloud sync, super fun and extremely useful and helpful for reflecting, getting to know yourself more, thinking, taking notes, making memories and MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU WILL NEVER LOSE YOUT INFORMATION 😭💖🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Greed has got the better of this lot. A subscription model does not suit a diary. Back to Google docs for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It seems only useful paid feature is to allow you to get your precious data. Expect daily notifications for a ""big sale event"" while keeping your own journal data as hostage. Thanks but no thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good place for private daily thoughts & photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app! It's exactly what I was looking for. I signed up for a year but I'm not sure if the value I get from a subscription is really great. I was disappointed with the writing prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The option that it provides to connect with our email is great. It helps me keep all my notes in pace without having to worry about loosing it even if I uninstall the app or loose my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Images keep auto rotate, although the phone orientation is locked. Please fix. Aa of 11/29, still not fixed, despite many exchanges with the developers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for a couple of days, simple to use and a clean UI. Geo-tagged journal entries a a great feature. Even the free version is good, but I went with premium. Platform specific licenses come at a fair price and it gives me access to everything I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely LOVE this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fácil de usar y si te gusta llevar tus memorias es muy útil"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can be a great journal app. For $44.00 the app should allow the function of writing with my S pen pro that I use with my galaxy fold 3. There is a coaching tab where it leads you to a web site link to give you ideas how to journal different styles of gratitude, blessings, motivation etc, which is nice but still not going to keep the app. You have a 3 day trial period before they harfe your card but you must give them your card information first so be sure to cancel the subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying using this app for my daily journals!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app to save things in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app. Sometimes it doesn't save my work, and the app will suddenly close and it loses all of my entry except for the first sentence or 2, and that's pretty frustrating. But all in all, it's a quality app that does exactly what I expect. I don't need frills or fancy colors. I just wanted a journal, and this app does that one job quite well. Very pleased."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good apk-- but i design the app very user friendly! I'm Ui designer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice appp"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing about life and writing thoughts It really is enlighting reading how i though like 2 years ago"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't know my pass code and can't figure out any options to get in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Weather, feelings, positions, memories all in one place. Having had 2 traumatic brain injuries I needed a place to put down everything I do because I don't always remember... Thank you. Your app is my tool to calm my head."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for Journaling! Recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome Experience, the only reason I'm giving a 4 star is because the web version which I prefer doesn't load properly sometimes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Has too many issues. Things written blank out and then you can't add to the entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. Makes it easy to transfer between phones and all my notes are still there. Lots of features. They push the membership pretty hard but I can't fault them for wanting to make money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I used to love this app. All the sudden it only allows me to write so many words in a day. I purchased the membership and I am still limited on what I can write. I can no longer go in and add anything to a day either. This needs to be fixed!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't upload .heic images."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used this app everyday for years now. Perfect companion to record my life experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't like you have to pay. Sound like a neat thing, but paying, forget it!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The highest quality journal app I've found, minimalist but with a good amount of features. I love the atlas feature that spreads your photos out across a map, worth it even just for that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall good, but having a ""compact"" mode would be nice, also it's very slow sometimes, especially when using a shortcut to crate a note, it can take up to 5 seconds to load"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app looked good enough until you realize it's gonna tell you about their premium offer EVERY TIME you open it. When the app gave me the ""Rate Us"" prompt, I clicked it and it sent me to customer support instead of here, the App Store, and then ask me for my email. This app is to make money, not help you make a journal. The visuals are eh"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am having trouble with the app since Android 12 update. Can't edit entries and experiencing crashes. App worked great before. I hope this issue can be resolved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to have this.. my phone got wiped out and it was easy to sign back in and have everything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app as well as the customization abilities with premium!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am so grateful for this app. So many times whether I'm driving alone or just need to take a time out from my day to reprogram I know I've needed to pull out my journal and get reconnected. This app allows me to do that easily. And I'm so grateful because it may have saved my life. Get this and use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Even though there is a pop-up advertising the premium subscription, it's just once per session, and it has some nice features like the mood tracker and tags. I'm not distracted from being able to just write whatever it is I feel the need to write in that moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for a few years now. So far any issues I've noticed have been ironed out pretty quickly. I had a moment of panic when Google decided Journey might not be trustworthy and I had trouble logging in, but I reached out to support and they were pretty quick to help me resolve those issues. One thing that has really impressed me recently is integration features using Zapier. Now when I post on Instagram, it's auto copied to my Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It just works. Have used it on Android and PC and have ha close to the same good experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My new favorite way to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app for journalling. Lots of features. I love saving photos of places I've been to on the map."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journals available. I have been a primium user since the beginning and I have seen it evolve. I am so glad I have it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love having this app on my phone because it's easy to do speech to text. I use it to jot down thoughts I want to bring up in therapy at my next appointment. It's super convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The coach has been good in nudging me to journal my day and thought's."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app is amazing, i love that they include back ups and have security features. i used to use a diary but i was always worried it would get destroyed or looked through. having a pin on the app and cloud back ups means i never have to worry. love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal app, I love it so mush been using it for almost almost 5 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cancelled my subscriptions over a year ago, and they keep trying to take membership fees from my bank account. I have tried emailing them, I can't find a phone #. They just ignore me. Now I have to go through my bank to put a stop payment on it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Love the format. Keep it up guys!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"O.K"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that everything syncs seamlessly between devices!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping notes and diary ON THE GO"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like that it works on all my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dope app. It's sooo fun to see all your achievements in one place. Helps me to see how far I've come since an year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I purchased the lifetime premium for this app on 2 Jul 2018, but I keep getting offers for membership and notices of limitations on my app. Is there a difference between the lifetime premium and membership?.... Very helpful. One app, multiple devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good journaling app, which I subscribed to (paid). I like the passcode/security in the app so others can't access my journal, as well as the synchronization functionality. It's something that just works for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good app but completely whacky after the last Android update today. Can't put in new entries at all... rendered useless"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great up for keeping records"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"the app is good. but the customer service is the worst. i ask a question and it takes a month of back and forth of following up before i get an answer which still does not address my issue"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always great to have"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App is good with nice interface, although personal templates are necessary. Please make automatic templates available for android device"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a silent ear that every story teller needs. I use it to communicate with the Lord and it has been one of the best decision I've ever taken."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it 💗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App that will be with me rest of my life...I wish I could be able to pay the developers of the app someday ❤️ to use amazing subscription features ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works as it says,been quite useful for me in keep track of activities and daily occurrences"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app for recording life events. Picks up the location to give the context. Recommeded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"dito ko nailalagay lahat ng hinanakit ko sa buhay HAHAHAHAHA thank u sa journey na app i love it so much po"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app untill it deleted my last 5 years of entries online and offline, I contacted the customer service and they told me they don't have any copy of my data so everything got lost for a sync error :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A nice journalling app with good features (mood chart, formatting features, easy media upload, throwback entries). I got the full version to start a journalling habit. Would give 5 stars if theres a way to add a caption to photos, and if there is an option to add a combination of photos and videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love it. It backed up to my Gmail account so when I broke my phone and had to get a new one, everything was there. Would definitely recommend !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years and I love the new updates over the years as they tell the story of my growth and development and most vulnerable moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seldom showing me ads, but gives me a way smaller reduction when I tap on ""redeem offer"". Very unsatisfactory."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good, do what i need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used this app 2years back, I love the fact it is easy to use and it help me with my memory problem, I wish you can get audio free again overall it is an extraordinary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hopeless application. I paid for the subscription twice. The money got deducted from my credit card and still the app shows error in the payment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing Journaling app. I can't speak to cross-platform comparability (because I haven't tried it, but that's a feature that led me to choose this journal App)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Guys You have a major bug with fetching photos from Gallery. It's quite frustrating. Update: it seems to be fixed now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I looked at a number of Journaling apps before deciding on Journey. After several months, with several changes of device, I am very impressed with the way data synchronizers between mobile devices and the cloud. I'm also impressed with how easy it is to include images in my entries. The price is reasonable, and I have no reason to look any farther. Recommend highly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I tried out the premium version of Journal one year ago. Today I got rebilled automatically without a reminder e-mail that I would get billed. I contacted support within 24 hours explaining the situation and asking for a refund. These are in my opinion non-ethical practices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app. Throwback entries are a lot more satisfying than I expected and they really help to provide perspective over a long time frame. I've learned that most of the little frustrating things that I get angry over are not only forgettable but trivial. It helps me to set goals and keep my head on straight."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like like, such an easy way to journal. Forget the evenings that's not the time to do it, brains don't experience things in day long chunks, it's a pretty irrelevant quantity. Journal when you have a cuppa, when you're already sat still or between tasks of the day, that's when thoughts naturally arise and I guarantee those are the thoughts that lead down interesting routs when they are explored through the written word. Forget the routine of writing before bed... Chose self exploration instead"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this as my digital journal for years and I love it. It was totally worth buying the lifetime membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a nice journal app with lots of features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ease of use is great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app seems to be going downhill. It loses text randomly. It also can't use select all then copy most of the time. I also can't use the clipboard and can only paste what was last copied. Undo/redo support would be very helpful as I have lost large chunks of text with no ability to get it back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for daily annotation of the world"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'd like to know why when I renewed my membership I lost everything from July to present? I've tried contacting you and I got no where. Please help! Very dissatisfied customer. This would have been a 5 star rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have to pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everytime I change mobile phone, there was no problem syncing the data when I load the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a pretty good app for journeying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful and helpful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"無法上傳圖片"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Keep up the good work! I can't rate the ads because I am an annual subscriber so I don't get ads! Well worth the money. Update: I still love the app however I have notified support about an issue. If you miss the daily prompt from your journey coach program there's no way currently to go back and complete it. This is unfortunate as I have been getting much benefit from answering the questions. I hope they can fix soon. Thanks for all your hard work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"There use to be a graph you could see for 30days and a year which was really good for keeping am eye on moods but I can't seem to find it anymore? Habe you got rid of it, that was a really helpful feature. Syncing is awful it always has issues. The pop up to upgrade come up Every time I try to click on something which is so frustrating and then the pop up to date the app comes up frequently too. I use to love the app but I've had to find a new one that doesn't keep doing that and graphs my moods"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"All good overall. The filunctionality I miss is word counter and statistics showing number of words per day in form of a graph. It's very useful for tracking your progress if you are struggling to create a journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for memory keepers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this journal for a couple of years now. Honestly, this has helped me stay on track with my life and wellbeing. Each time I fall into a down phase, journalling has helped me align myself and my thoughts, work out the negativity and struggles and pick myself up. If there is one word I associate with this journal, it is 'healing'. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary or journal or both. Easy to navigate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Tis journal app is still great. I've been using it every other day. But there was a bug where my Google account was unable to connect so I've been logging as a User instead. I was able to fix it by transferring data to my new phone. Customer service was fast to respond so thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. I bought the premium version to support the developer. ✌️ Edit: I would like to tell you that you aren't giving a lot if I take the ""lifetime membership."" I can literally do those things for free. I mean I can write entries and email myself. I would have access on mobile and desktop. I could also print them and copy and paste all my emails in MS Word. There's nothing different except inspirational quotes and themes. And those aren't really worth a subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep small memories on the go!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really helps me out. To express my emotions through writing. Feels like I'm letting it all out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Unable to get App to update my last name, although it is correct literally everywhere else, including my Google account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Wish you could have separate journal streams though. Like one for work and one for play."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I just downloaded this app one a chromebook and notice the sutocorrect feature on the IOS version seems to be missing. I like just about everything else about the app. If it had autocorrect this would be great. Is there a way to turn it on, am I missing something?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling on the go, much easier to stick to this habit! I wish we could have different/multiple notebooks, just like IRL, for different topics for instance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. I paid for a year membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy-to-use app. I like using it as a travel journal :) would be great if it could be up-to-date for geotags with Google Maps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journal is very cool app., that can link your diary between handphone and laptop. Can type in both English and my native language- Myanmar."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice to vent my rage and depression inside of an app it helps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but wished the web version should have search feature, thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great easy to use app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Won't link Google drive to my account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is where I put my personal experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It wiped out AAAALLLL of everything I ever wrote...!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very simplistic and smooth experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has everything you need for diary writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love how easy and convenient it is to just open this app from my phone whenever my head starts writing and remembering every moment of my life. It is free to use. Though you are not allowed to put more than 4* images, I'm glad to have this app around me. Syncing can be an issue - even with a good internet, I always trouble syncing my diary. However, the only annoying part is the constant premium version ads and the reminder to rate the app, hence why I am here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I just love it that is why I upgraded to the full version. Update: but it would be great to include a ticker, an emoji or a picture on the page itself. Currently, it can only attach a picture."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Long time user but I have downgraded to two stars as the program does not seem to allow user to print out an entire journal without generating a page for EACH! entry. Almost a deal breaker except that I can't find an acceptable alternative journal/diary. I wish there was simple formatting- i.e. underscore, bold, italics. Finally, location is incorrect but does not allow correction in spite of editing option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been my go to personal talk to write it down take a picture app. I absolutely like this app. Keep up the good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The problems I encountered got resolved. This app is really excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Salamat. Salamat sa app na to. Sobra."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So happy with this app...surprise us more with the improvements...for me i am already happy with this but happier whenever i see improvements that i didnt know i need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well built app for journal writing. Recommends to get it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Too many ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Their customer assistance is very helpful and informative!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Vry easy to navigate around. Love how it automatically dates your entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was looking for some app that could be used as a diary. And this one is the better one (and I've tried a lot)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would have rated 5 stars but I don't like the update. I love when I could add audio, pictures and documents to a single day entry. Now I'm stuck with just 1 audio per day entry or only pictures per day entry. I would really love if that option could be brought back. I am on a premium plan and I will love to get my money worth."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using it 10 years in a row, support is great - I had the right answers even during off-working hours."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me a lot. I can reflect and change myself and progress my career and journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Signed into my journal account with my email, and I can't restore all my saved entries. Please help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is as good as I expected. Interface is not super new, but the free version is really low on ads and really useful to use. I am thinking to buy pro, just to get some extra benefits and show my gratitude for the guys who made it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling apps are so subjective and personal that all I can say is I love this particular one. I've tried many others, and the UI actually makes me want to use it. A good app is one you use, I suppose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"not free - it's like $3.49 a month , which must be billed annually (iow you cant pay monthly, you have to pay the roughly $42 annual fee at once. Needless to say, I uninstalled it, so I dont really know much more about the app itself. What I DO know, however, is that there are far too many FREE journal/notebook apps that are super cute & readily available to justify spending money on this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Loved it when I first got it. Even the premium version was a reasonable price. Now it is much too costly. The free version doesn't work as smoothly as it used to and I miss the throwbacks. It was so easy to view them! I used to journal every day, but since the update there seems to be less and less features available. I think I might go back to my access database. I also really don't like that you can't download your entries on the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"journey is a good app.i strongly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only decent free app on the play store for journaling. I like the option for using your personal Drive storage as cloud storage, as it cuts out the middle man with cloud storage and I do not have to pay extra. The UI is the only thing I feel it falls short, because while it is good, it feels a little plain, and I would pay a buck or two to be able to add custom skins. I feel as if adding additional mood reacts, as well as a way to track that specifically over time should be there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No manual."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Grid seems a revolutionary new idea but it's always been the best idea and maybe you are the discoverer! I'm using a 2x8 grid and each line I write sends me to the next! What a treasure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nicee"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good. Three option is one journal but with tags you can separate the contents by tags which find interesting. Since I'm not on social media this is how I post private status updates. There is a public option but I've not ever used it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have subscription on my ipad, should I again Subscribe on my Android?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only free for first 3 days!! Whats the point?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this little app! Easy to use with a lot of smart cross features, it fits a variety of needs. Handy for jotting a note to help you remember to writing highly detailed information this app can help. Work, family events, personal progress, medical stuff or just wanting to remember the interesting places and nummy foods encountered while traveling. I've recommended this app to several people, those who have given a shot have said they like it too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using this app for quick journal entries. It is easy to use and passcode protected. Great job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Updated:. Had sync issues after recent updates. Help desk gave immediate response and all working great again. Still a great app. Great diary app. Love the picture function, the tagging and the backup. Worth the purchase fee for sure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good app and helps writing your emotions out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please please stop shoving these ads on our throats. The option to upgrade to premium should be available somewhere on the app, but it shouldn't be everytime you open it. It's annoying and it takes away good user experience. It shouldnt also pop up everytime you save an entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app the only thing that would make it better is if you could add tasking feature to it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Very good journal. Lots of great features. Using this since 2016. Happy that it is ad-free too. But it shows pop-ups to upgrade to premium version too frequently. Every 2 minutes it is interrupting with these pop-ups and that is very demotivating. Feels like ads are better. Premium version is unreasonably a bit too expensive than expected."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has changed my life. I know, I know. Sounds like a bot review. But like I was in the mental ward and it popped up at a super coincidental time and I was like huh. That's kinda spooky. Why not? Worth it. Best decision. I wouldn't be here without. That being said, here isn't like super amazing. But I'm alive. I've got two awesome kids and an amazing partner. That's enough for me. Thank you Journey. Very cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great 👍 never any issues love this app recommended for sure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Declined Debit Card for ******FREE******* Trial LOL. How does this even happen? And of course to make any slight kind of change you have to be a ""premium"" member. Yeah, no thanks. App is ran by a bunch of money grubbers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a cool app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this journal app. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app states you will receive notification of the trial period ending so that you can decide if you want to continue and subscribe. They do not send any notification at all. They take the money from your account and THEN notify you! Don't subscribe to the trial period if you aren't 100% sure you want it. I am now stuck with 12 months of a very ordinary app that i don't really want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is my FAVORITE mental health and self care app. It's a journaling app that makes journaling fun. I don't pay for apps, especially when there are so many free ones out there but I pay for Journey. It's a small amount of money that helps my mental health and helps me get my thoughts in order. It's a win-win. I would love to promote Journey daily because I believe in them. Journey, without you idk how I would have made it through some days. I've been a member for over a year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy journal app.Love it. Want to use for sometime and then go for premium. Hopefully if I can get a trial and then I can make a fast decesion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the convenience of the app so that I can journal anywhere I'm at. Adding photos to better express experience creates a wonderful way to go back and remember events and places, and at some future time for my children and grandchildren to see my life through my eyes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the app. When I changed the phones and the journal opened completely empty on the new one I almost had a heart attack (been writing for 3 years). Bug we sorted it out - still one star off for the scare"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth using. 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Does so much. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal app ever. Easy and well thought design."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Kalo ada fifur autosave / draft bakalan lebih baik"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Really helps get things off my chest so I don't dwell on them all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it helps me with my memory and reminds me of things. Thank you 9/07/2016 update still using this on a daily basis. Now a firm feature in my opinion. Brilliant Ann. 15/10/2021 update love the new features. Still using on daily basis. Thank you so much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but I couldn't find the settings anymore and the slideshow was quite fast for me. It seemed to me that the entire team was still in the process of making tweaks. Nevertheless, I look forward to your brilliant updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Marvellous experience! I cant stop but compliment how great this app is. I could not sync my journal to the Mac app. When I contacted the Journey team, the reply was very responsive. They helped me to resolve this issue even after their working hours. I would like to see the app to continue its development. Here are some of my suggestions: (1) Multiple journal. 🙏 (2) Editable tag (3) Link coach to the Mac app. Hope to see these features soon! Good luck Journey devs and all the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. I was doubly charged and they are just ignoring my case. I subscribed last year on Annual membership plan. A month before is set to expire this year, I upgraded my plan to Lifetime membership. However, I was still again charged on my annual dues. At first, John of Journey replied to refund the amount. After that email, I haven't heard anything thereon. I made several follow up again and nobody cares to reply. What a way to treat your customer..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Umlaut signal figurine total install got to flash in groin stigler. Despite Bill Grundy strudel imaging this initiates a flip tragedy. Could supply after dig boil traffic. Unique flat niggles too floundering supple hinges. Total grip on surfit nibbles."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"10/10: I paid for the lifetime membership but got charged for a year in September.Sent emails so far (9/19, 9/30, 10/10, 10/13 ), no response. 10/13 contacted via feedback chat to get response 10/14 after several back and forth they realize a year between charges! ""Ohh, my apologizes, I missed out the 5 Sep 2021! Sure, I will escalate this billing issue to my team. Meanwhile, please cancel your recurring subscription."" Only time will tell if refunded & if I will loose access 2022."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy writting in this app... thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gratefulness"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"5yrsusing the app, bought the paid version until I received notice my 15gb Google drive is full and only option is to buy more space.i have One drive but this app only works with Google drive. Contacted support; no response or solutions given to my questions so have to migrate to diarium app which provides more flexibility in which cloud storage you wish to work with. Also they remove the Google map option so useless to find locations to add to your journal afterwards."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, been using for years now. The only thing I don't like is that the night mode toggle is hidden away in the settings menu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great So Far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great and fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for so long as a premium subscriber but recent updates have ruined the experience. The throwback entries section is not working properly. Whenever I go to the Today section to see what I had written in previous years it opens up any random entry rather than the one I am clicking on. Please correct this bug with a prompt update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is just so awesome. 😄😅🙌 Very fun to use once you start using it. 10 stars!!!!!! The app is so amazing that it is enjoyable to use again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Diary App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too many pop-ups pushing the premium version. Please stop pushing the premium version on us every second we open the app. And it keeps coming again and again. Makes me wanna switch over to another app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"anyone else having issues logging in or syncing to the cloud after the new update?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for collecting journal information. Notes can put context of photos along with dates and locations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You cannot add tags and cannot do many things that you can easily do in the iOS app. You may pay here. You still need to pay separately for the iOS app.. DayOne is nicer in general, and at least has a level of grouping other than tags but its Android app is terrible.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Have used this app for several years and love it, but please change the flashbacks back to how they were. The new slideshow format (something like Facebook stories) could work alright for entries that were just one photo but they make navigating through text entries or entries with multiple media files very difficult. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me a lot. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks for being my silent partner"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app for my personal journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't normally write reviews but I have to for this app. Recently got into writing daily about my life and this app is brilliant for that. I bought the a lifetime membership, and I have access to awesome features that has made me motivated to write everyday. I can't wait to look back in the future and read all my thoughts and experience, as an example you have a calendar feature where u can go back easily visualise the entried. Great product!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Daily user. To anyone looking for a daily driver for a diary or journal, this is the app for you. Active since 2018. Thanks dev for this magic application, been part of my life, and will continue to be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I reset my phone, I downloaded the app again. Now all I my entries got lost. Please help how can I retrieve it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I am enjoying it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Over the years, I tried several different apps and I always come back to Journey. It's a great app! It allows for markdown writing, tags, photo entries, weather and location check in, and a few more goodies. I recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy visual survey of what and when happened of what you are thinking and doing, or keeping track of. Great for progress overview."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app ,neat and clean"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great wee app for keeping a journal. I particularly like it's ease of use and absence of ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app I have ever used amogts others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Devastated. Over 1,500 entries are somehow gone. Come on Journey, I've paid for the full version. someone that knows about this problem I really need help. Help me retrieve my memories. Idk what happened bc I'm using the SAME backup svc I've always used. I think changes on your end messed me up. I can't be the only one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great little app, journal entries are easy and the interface is user friendly. I'd like to be able to attach more photos 🖼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've had the app for a little over a year now. I initially really liked the app. It's convenient for on the go and when I travel. The issues lie in the recent months. The app was having issues with me logging in using my Google email. Then I updated my name on my Google account, but it did not and still has not reflected in the app. I've reached out to get support on the matter, but no response. I paid for a premium account but now I am on the side of wishing I didn't even give them my money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice journalling app. I really like the ability to sync between web and app for free, adding photos and media is easy on the app, the UI is simple and easy but has plenty of great features for easy journalling. Appreciate the import option from Day One, which has pretty much been replaced for me by this. Keep up the great job guys! Update 10/2021: still loving it, great app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Still have blank pages here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hey, the new update is really great! I'm a happy 1.5 year premium user. Something I'd like to see, maybe, are word count stats (how much you wrote this month, this year, etc.) :)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary app I've used to date. I've started others and eventually quit making journal entries. This is the only I continue to keep a journal on. 2021 and Still this best journal for Android. Update... I'm still using this app and continue to track my life events on it. It keeps getting better all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for several years now and couldn't be happier. Great job! 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This application change me and my spouse, my spirituality and my why"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"paid for it but stll has ad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that it's backed up to my Google account. I've tried all the journal apps and this is still my favorite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for more than 2 years, and it has been perfect, up until the new update. I used to enjoy reading my throwbacks, but now they've made it a slideshow, giving me a few seconds to read each entry (far too little time!) and a progress bar that steals much of my attention. So much for reflection on my past experiences... This feature seems to totally go against what the app is for!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice aap just free it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I subscribed last year but later cancelled my subscription as it wasn't for me. Subsequently just been charged USD29.99 for another 12 months even though I have cancelled my account. Have contacted them about this directly but no response. Very poor."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Downloaded the app after reading a review on the 29th of the 9th this year stating you could buy a the app instead of a subscription. It's now the 7th of th 10th and this has changed. Sadly as I first open the app straight away it's asking me for credit card details for £50 for the year... Not gone past this. Not even to try the trial.. potentially looks a great app but price is too rich for my pocket.. would have considered buying but paying min 50 quid a year for life. No thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's worth trying the trial and it for anything for personal use etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Decent, don't like that pay wall"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this app, however my buttons for mood, font, etc. aren't working on my Chromebook. Also, my Chromebook isn't syncing with my Samsung."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful for Journaling and keeping things organised and up to date. Highly recommended for writers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for a while now and I'm very happy with it. Two thumbs up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only problem will be remembering to make a daily entry. Although the backdate option is very handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love chicken noodles!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. This has given me ample time incase of usung multiple devices i can still access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I need it to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's quite a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a daily diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"New ""stories"" feature is horrible. Bring back the Today tab please"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The new throwback in Stories is a nice touch"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for almost 5 years now. There has been a recent update that causes issues when viewing journals. I can select dates for a few days but then the days start overlapping on top of each other and eventually they disappear until I force close the app and open again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great as a premium user! Awesome to track and integrate everything from workouts to study!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, I am too stingy to use recurring subscriptions though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good aps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have the premium version and there are just too many annoying pop-ups that keep coming back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for Journaling on the go"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What an awesome tool! I would be lost without it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great for keeping day to day scrapbooks and notes The new updates have some cool features I am sure I will find some of these features useful. I would have given the app 5 stars if there were tutorial of the new version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Buyer beware! The developer has some very shady practices; they turn on auto-renew by default without notification, do not send out a notification of impending renewal payment and has a strict 'no refunds' policy. If, like me, you sign up to try the app on a discounted annual price, don't use the app much and then forget about it, the next communication that you will get will be the charge notification for the increased amount that is non-refundable. It is very shady business policy. I propose that the developer uses a discount to lure in trials, sets auto-renew to 'ON' with no notification, doesn't inform users ahead of renewal so they have the option to cancel and then imposes a strict no refund policy. Decide for yourself if that is who you want to do business with. Just be aware."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what you want and nothing you don't. Simple and clean app, been using it for over a year now and I love it. 3 years straight now. Still loving it. Had to change phones at one point and the transition and upload was seamless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"After new update. I hate the pro version app. If you cant afford the pro version, just find the other app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so good for keeping all of your secrets and thoughts I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app and it also has great customer service if you have a issue. Thank you so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Have been journalling for years and it's been an app that's been getting better over the years. Really useful to record and write your memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very functional. I like the fact that I never lose entries even when I uninstall the app or change phones. Simple and easy to use. The best there is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Whether you choose the free or paid version this all is amazing. Helps me stay focused and also reminds me when I have a busy day to take some time to journal. If you are new to journalling trust me it's going to change your life, this app will help you too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for 3 years. I only use it as a ""gallery"", to store pictures I like from Tumblr. I love it, it's so easy to use & displays the gallery in a very aesthetically pleasing way. Great app, would definitely recommend. I've npt experienced any bugs or other issues with it. Easy to password protect as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app sucks can't use microphone to text not good for disabled people screw you developers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Where does all the time go? Be your you expert!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good. Love this app. So happy to be able to record my memories in picture form so easily. 🤗🤗 Just wish I could get it to sync to Google cloud??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app!😍😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bought Journey a couple of years ago and am very happy with the product. Big pluses are that it is on pc mac android and ios as well as its customisation options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just wanted to take the time to write this review. I haven't had the app very long. It's a great app, but just wanted to say thank you for giving us the option to actually buy it outright instead of having a subscription looming over our heads forever. Most app developers are too greedy to offer for people to have the privilege to just good old fashioned buy it. In the day & age of zip pay, this pay, that pay, subscriptions, blah blah blah.. Thank you, Team Journey, for not farming us."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome customer support. Fonts and exporting entries are simple and dependable. Does everything and gets out of the way to let you actually use it. I feel very safe with Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I liked it. I bought the license. Please stop asking me to rate your app. That's worse than ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this for years ... it is sometimes a little bossy as I do not use it every day or week. It is easy to use and I enjoy writing in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful, even as free. It transfers to new phones. As a consumer I love to support good companies and products but honestly we have too many apps in use to do that financially. I appreciate that I can use the app without upgrading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its easy to use and i really like the guided journal add ons as a member. Worth the subscription if u are used to already buying paper journals regularly. Quick and prompt customer service is also a boost! Am a very satisfied membership customer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used to handwrite my journals in the past which resulted in tonnes of notebooks on my shelves. Stumbled across this app and been using for years. Really wish it has an option to draw and scribble notes! That's awesome for creative thinkers, esp on my cookbooks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to navigate😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ease of transition from the app to the web."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary & journal app. Much better than keeping a physical diary or journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great option for a 'free' experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oh boy. I've been trying almost every journal app on Playstore, but nothing compares to Journey. I bought the Lifetime Premium last year, and I do not regret it. Keep up the good work, team. Lots of love. Recent addition: Thank you for enabling colorful letters and highlights! I'm still using Journey until today. Never stopped. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK Journey Team :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why would you force discounts on me without giving me a chance to use the app. To get a feel for it. Having to enter access code continuously. I can't even get used to it and try to like it. It looks promising but way too expensive and too pushy. Wish I had time to get the whole experience and than got the best offer, a price worth paying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was enjoying the app and used it all the time then one day I lost all my journal entries, not sure why or where they went. Just to say it was very upsetting. I was able to recover my journal entries so give it a five star again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Export to docx does not contain the date of entry. So if you cancel at some point you lose a very important part of the journal. For a paid subscription I expect to be able to cancel and take my data with me. When I try to get a refund I get a security warning and cannot access the form. This is BAD!!! Online chat is unavailable during posted service hours."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"2021/09/24: After the latest update it's been buggy, when I try to view my old entries from ""today"" view, and choose a second entry from a year ago, I kept getting redirected to the most recent of that day and have to swipe to view the second entry. Before I can click it directly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does what it says it does, and thus far it's the best journal app I've used for free. *Edit* as a free user I was able to recover my entries after my phone crashed (upped to 5 stars)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app . Have been using it for years. Fun and reliable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Okay. Not great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a very good journaling app. It is both convenient and easy to use. I appreciate the convenience of being able to journal anytime that I have access to my phone... which is always. The only improvement to the product that I might want... would be for it to always autosave content when exiting the product. I have lost a few entries here and there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It can sync in my laptop, tab, and mobile phone. Love it! Good for people who likes practicality."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Capture your journey and life experience here. There are things that you'd want to share with the world, on social media. But there are moments, especially improvement progress and deep thoughtful moments that you'd want to keep just tp yourself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tq ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app weeks ago and i feel comfortable on using it, i feel safe when i share my thoughts and dreams in this app. Its a great app so im giving it a 5 star ratings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can't log in to my old account after app version upgraded"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Funtionally a good app but I've been using it for over a year now and see room for improvement. Am most annoyed by constant popups and requests to upsell. The latest asked me to rate them (again), so I've come in to change my five star rating to four."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Today after I opened this app, all my previously saved entries are all disappeared, all my data are gone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best wishes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's pretty great, it's really helped me not down things in a way I, for some reason, feel more comfortable with"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app for 3 years. Best experience i've had in journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I give a rating coz the app always nagging about it. meh."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tried for 3day free trail now not giving refund and option to cancel subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I stated using it in 2015, then I stopped in 2021 again I stated using and I see lot of improvement already happened. I like the app but please can you decerese the subscription prices so that we can buy. And add more free features as very less are available like when I used in 2015 the test bold was available free but today its not. Please add more free features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great. Helping a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best App I've Ever Seen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, no issues at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why did they change the calendar layout after all these years?!? It's so much more clunky and not nearly as clean looking. I wish they would give us options to choose from as opposed to just overhauling the UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using the app for some time. Like that it syncs between android devices and the web version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the app but was still charged for an app I didn't use because I didn't like it ...I'm absolutely furious with Google Play and journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I thought this might of been free, it is not. The diary has a monthly fee. Misleading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great for getting thoughts down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In love with this app . Its features are amazing. Using this app from last 1.5 years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. So private and the price is fine on a month to month basis. I can record whatever I want, whenever I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I love this app. I just installed on my new phone and logged in with Google. All of my entries are gone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it says and does it well, it's free if you want it to be but the pop ups only come once and aren't to annoying. A definite for anyone wanting to keep a record or private journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for like 6 years. It's amazing. Everything is always right there where I left off too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😍😍😍😍 Amazing app And help full I love u Journey thank you for everything 😙😙😙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can you add an option to change profile pictures please"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. I just bought the dame thing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great tool for Journaling your every day thoughts. Etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"OK"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can't change name or personal icon on account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it, the Application is easy to use and easy to adjourn. Some more Features yould not hurt it, as for Example quick - Simple column Entries in diverse colors for Days where you are Exhausted or Travelling, or your Work one even your favorite Occupation hasn't leaft you any spear Time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not syncing and there is no help either. Even reinstalling the app has wiped out all data... So bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried many but I'm settled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and good to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm thankful I found this app. It helps me pracitce my writting skills and to build a right grammar. And also to express my feelings freeely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After the latest update, many of my entries have vanished and I can't even import them from Google Drive. In fact they can't even be found in Google Drive! I'm appalled and utterly disgusted. PS After reinstalling the app, the same entries are missing. I'm beginning to think they're gone for good. After using it for nearly four years without any problems, I'm so disappointed with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great and pleasurable experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No Thanks. Almost $50 a year and zero options for monthly. It's just a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for about 2 years and never plan on getting rid of it. I use it for everything lists, entries, ideas, just everything that needs to be written down and I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's working back again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice layout and easy to use I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"2021: I installed it again and could not restore purchase as 2 years ago. Same device and google account. When I touch on the ""Restore Purchase"", it switches to ""restoring"" status in few seconds. But nothing happen with my account. ----- 2019: App is so good! Just a question, do you sell this app by device? I bought it (once - forever premium) on my phone but installing it on my tablet gives me free version and it asked for buying again! ----- Update: Thanks for your quick answer. It worked. I have to remove other Google Accounts on the device before restoring purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using the free version of this app for more than 5 years. The data transfers even if you change phone as long as you have account. The paid version gave you PDF/word file of it, themes, journal entry via Email and quotes. What I like about the app is, it notes the time when you write the journal, or when the photo was taken. This is a nice diary, that notes almost every detail of your life: your mood, time, location, weather and photos. Very recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app for quite sometime now and I like the features they keep adding to enhance user experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's easy to navigate and has a nice appearance. I'm VERY thankful for the cloud feature. Over 450 entries were recovered from my lost phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and effective. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great App! Im looking forward to journaling now. And I can already see how journaling is helping me coach myself!!! And they have a ""Coach"" section that gives you daily journal prompts based on which area you'd like to gain clarity on. Beautiful. Thank you so much developers. God bless and keep shining!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Used to be a Fantastic Diary. I especially loved being able to add photos of my day. Update has added stupid blurry edges to ruin photos. Good job I didn't upgrade. Hope nothing else gets ruined. Why fix something that works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like that app syncs between my Android phone and my pc using Google Drive. It is why I chose this app over others. I really love the new scrolling calendar with the photo images appearing on each day. Super useful when adding historical images. Not sure if it's possible in the future, but it would be great to be ablevto move the 10 image tiles around to change order. At the moment I re-download photos and re upload to change order which is a little frustrating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A complete scam. Be upfront and don't compare yourself to youtube. Youtube doesn't require you to pay ridiculous prices to use basic features of their app. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS APP."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Journey development team, I think you ought to look into the app sync problem that made some users (including me) lose their journal entries and their memories. I even tried logging in the web app but received the message ""Oh snap! There's a problem linking cloud account""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So far so good. It's been really helpful with daily ideas and activity. Update Sept of 2021. Unfortunately, all my previous entries are gone. I have the paid version. I did enjoy it but I need an app that keeps my thoughts. That or back to pen and paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All my entries randomly got deleted from the last 2 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like that I can access the journal on my desktop and phone. The search is handy, but I wish that you could print the results."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing retention of memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Everything is gone! I opened the app today and my account is gone? What happened to all my entries?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since Dec. 2015. Easy to use and has been with me through many adventures helping to chronicle those experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I had this app for 4 years and it updated and everything was erased. I had SO much on there. Hundreds of entry's."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app just keeps up even with changing phones or computers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Let us record for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please, please, please fix it soon. Last update was a mess. The fixed, unnecessarily huge side bar on tablet is a huge annoyance to me, but worst of all is the new dark theme. It looks okay on the default page, but when I open an entry, the font is black on dark, making it unreadable. Weirdly enough, in edit mode, the screen becomes white while the font remains black, which makes the dark theme a moot point. Rolling back to older version for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. I love it. Simple and does the work. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love how smooth it is. Perfect! Thank you 💕 Edit: Hello! Recently, I've been facing some problems of your app. Whenever I write or type, it's unresponsive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb apps for writing a journal or a diary!😆"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great customer service 👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Instantly wanted to charge me 3days free what use is that"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent performance..!!! Before use this app, i used Diaro. Then, Journey imported diaro backup files effortlessly. Other features also attractive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Aplicativo limitado, pobre edição de textos, não funciona direito no Mac, utiliza a sua conta Google para sincronizar o aplicativo, fui cobrado pela anuidade, paguei e logo depois cancelei a assinatura, como já estava paga por um ano eu tenho o direto de usar o aplicativo pelo tempo pago, mas não foi isso o que aconteceu, só posso usar agora uma versão mais pobre ainda do que já é... Experiência frustrante 😤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Waste downloading for an expensive subscription I could buy a book for a one off purchase for a fraction of one payment, not for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A quick and meaningful way to collect your thoughts and look back at them with ease"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using this on and off for years now, great the way old notes are always available, even after several reinstalls."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the cloud hosted part 9f this. I never worry about losing this as I change devices. I can also access it from any device. Has some Export functions and also ties into other app ecosystems without me feeling like my privacy is at stake. I don't regret paying for a lifetime premium access, and have never been let down by the app or customer service. Nothing about this app annoys me, and I've been using if for about 4years quite regularly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years now and even uploaded past journal entries into it. Sometimes I pull it out to jot down a quick thought and don't even realize how much is about to pour out. It's also good for on the spot journaling vs having to actually write in a journal. If you're someone who can't always predict exactly when you need to write it out, that's the kind of thing this app is great for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great but the mood chart is not flexible, it would be nice If only we could see the stats for each month separately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good for tracking your moods, projects and thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great UI. Lots of options including location, emojis, weather and so much more. Nice little reminders on this date. It's now my only journal. Love that it's synced with Google."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Should be upfront about being a fully paid app instead of wasting our time in installs n then asking for Credit Card info. Not sure if it works for the company, but sure comes across as Sneaky."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After August update not possible to login to google drive. Support received when writting to their mail was very poor."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"OK"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good for capture as you think Update . Used since early 2019 It gets better over time Now September 2021 and still finding it very useful in itself over several devices (PC, phones and tablet). I keep written journals. Journey helps me by keeping all online and digital stuff and also is my only mood tracker. I use Journey to ""capture"" everything I later want to record in my written journals. I opted for the Pro version early on and it's great. The free version was also good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So great. Easy to use... Let's you add pictures and video in a snap!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bought a lifetime membership 2 years ago, got a new phone and now they claim it's expired. These new prices are stupid expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy every moment I write my minds thoughts and the weird and exciting adventures life sure thing thanks for your contact love this mental therapy app and so offended by them words and sometimes having to use them. Instead it should be I'm only human"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Updated: 2021, I still have this app and i still use it. I absolutely love it. I have had this app for quite a while. It is awesome that you can attach images from a while back and it will use the metadata to get weather, date and location to add to your post. It makes it easy to catch up and add a few posts from the past and have the accurate date and time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the perfect life companion <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant as always"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My Number 1 Journal App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"رائع"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect App. It has helped me to track every day of my life. Thanks Journey team for making such a great app. Only problem is media attachment please increase the same...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me go through things and to cope with my emotions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app and support! App is just outstandingly useful and support is always patient enough to understand my concerns and provide solutions..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! But I wish some things are free though but it's fine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it very much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy-to-use love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and simple. Meets all my needs for journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DON'T BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App for my daily diary. Thank you! Keep improving the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for years now way before it required membership to become a premium user. I settled for the free one because aside from the fact that I cannot afford to pay, I was also so confident that my entries will be sync when I sign in my account but unfortunately I've been trying a couple of times already but all of it are gone now and I have no back ups of those entries I wrote anymore 😔"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I haven't opened the app for a few days. I open it this morning, and all it says is ""Migration complete"" and it won't accept my PIN to log in. I've lost all of my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Love 😍.. Da da man da. No. Will not restore my purchase and wants more money for every device you use it on. Journal this!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is functional but not exemplary. Annoyingly the app will only accept MP3 audio files. Support for m4a files for iOS users (it's a multi platform app) is overdue as is Apple Watch support. Being able to attach PDF files would also be a great idea. Good points? The app received a UI refresh and I've got to say I'm really liking it. Choices of other cloud storage systems would be good (Dropbox, iCloud etc), but Google Drive works well. The dev releases frequent updates which is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app! The best customer service!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't type, keyboard is unusable. Can copy and paste only. Ongoing issue for a month. Android 12 Beta Pixel 3XL"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for a few years. I love how I can see my posts on a calendar, search by tags, and dark mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just updated the app and all of my journal entries of over the past five or six years is all gone......"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my go to app always. I am lost without it. I have a medical issue involving short term memory & I have tried many apps to help me jot things down quickly & still stay organized. Journal does so much more. I can copy & paste anything, snap a picture or screenshoot to attach and even find with ease what I wrote no matter how much time has passed. All pages are dated with original time & automatically saved. I have been using Journal for years & the yearly membership is so worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nothing helps me be myself like Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please make mood tracking more powerful like that of Remente App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good good and good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Pointless UI Update. I will never ever understand why developers feel the need to fix things that were never broken. I can't stand the new calendar interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Its just a diary app, nothing really helpful unless you want to pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app. Most consistent journal I can use, and (supposedly) will carry over between devices, which is super reassuring."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Recent update, absolutely brilliant. Well done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works really well, clean and fast."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this app for years. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Be careful ! Once you start using the app, you will find most of the features you need will be under premium. And premium is huge. At least for an Indian user. Find some other app and pay it first. For lifetime. Because we can't transfer all entries to another diary after long use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing and the best journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, I use this everyday! One thing I think the app lacks is a drawing feature where we can draw on the notes but otherwise it's a great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Over this app after 5 years of use. Sad to see my history and timeline go but this app has continually been developing backwards and even if they develop anything they will charge you extra for it on top of your original payment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"An extremely difficult service to unsubscribe from!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for journalling with good UI, sync using drive. Works perfectly well for daily journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'd like font options, and more color backgrounds. I paid for the app and was hoping for more than what it actually offers. I think I was hoping for more customization options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great app. I am in rehab and it really helps me keep track of urges and daily journaling. If i could afford the premium i would get it for sure.....Recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a nice app. I use it, not very frequently but I try. And it's nice to read past entries and automatically be there to live that moment thath already happened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent way to use, very productive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used to journal religiously when I was growing up and life has made that nearly impossible for the last ten years. Journaling is extremely helpful as a tool to cope. This app brought it to the tips of my fingers and has made it so easy to personalize. You can use the free option just fine but I found that I was journaling in the dark sometimes and wanted the night option so I paid. But it's worth it! Incredible app. I've been using it consistently for nearing a month. In love."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Damn, all my entry gone after latest update. Fix it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great companion"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"At least you could've just fix your Google Drive API. I couldn't be less bothered by that. Your apps getting trash daily by bad management, people was expecting this to be amazing cloud synced journal app meanwhile this, and those confusing premium membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app,Journey it is similar to a diary. I think journey is better than a diary. I recommend Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I'm enjoying my journal diary experience it's quick, convenient, straightforward and simple to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have this app across Macbook, iPhone, iPad, android tablet. I've had all devices and this is works on all of them. I love the throwback notifications as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app thank you for creating it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too much of advertising"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very happy with the application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, hard to find time to use it. Even though it only takes few minutes. Good layout and possible Promots to helpful material to read"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please stop sending me reminder asking me to rate your app. And please stop putting those discount msgs and a timer on top of the app when I open the app. I already paid for the app premium but since you created so many levels of different purchases, i will not invest into your app's other packages. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Rewarding app when used well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app. Wish the free version had different themes but that's just an aesthetic thing so not very important. I like the layout and the way it organizes entries, very excited to have these memories saved complete with pictures and videos. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ok journal app, needs integration with Google photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"STOP ASKING ME TO BUY PREMIUM"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had a good experience with journey but I would like to know how can I sign in with my other email address"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy app to keep track of animal health issues. 8/21 ... still a happy user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use journey on a daily basis. The sync online and to the phone or my iPad makes it easy to keep up my journaling efforts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been 11 months... i like it. Easy, simple but crisp and fulfilling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was expensive, cancelled in 24 hours, never used, never got my credit or cash back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for years and have not been disappointed in it's functionality at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love love!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Import feature doesn't work. Memories gone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, best journal thus far and can really be a mental support system when needed to clear things out of your mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is seriously the best diary app out there that there ever was. End of story, lol."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app but $30/yr is entirely too expensive!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app works so well. Easy to navigate, lots of features and syncs effortlessly between devices. I recommend buying the lifetime option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Used to love this journal...had it since 2016 but now you have to pay for everything...I used to be able to speak to type but you have to pay for that too...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good Journaling app. More features if you pay a subscription, but it's pretty good without."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am a new user. I have not been have much experience with this app. But, I love it so far. I think, it's simple and easy to use. thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpfull"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling. Clean interface. Memories are great to look back and be thankful 😊🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I fail to see why a journal app would be subscription based and so ridiculously expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No stylus support so I hate this app now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect for adding daily thoughts and experiences. I've been using this for 3 years now and I love it. I can access it from my computer, phone, or tablet. It makes Journaling fun and easy. I love seeing the past years come up too, memories are gold."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love everything on this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would have been great if saving was automatic (on laptop version). I've had so many times when I lose all my text because I forgot to save it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice journal. I keep coming back to this one. It has nice features for a free app. If you want all the extras you have to go premium but it's great without it. Great for freewriting or just journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and multiple features to decorate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Liked it (2018) because I could use it from smart phone or web. But now they want ... what was it, near $50 a year. Not that valuable to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does it so far and wonderful ui"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, tons of functionality, never crashed yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app! Best I've worked with!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy interface, love that I can come back anytime and all my entries are still there!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really great, BUT: You cant export data in a friendly format. Since GDPR, they have to provide an export, and you can get all content in a zip, with images and json - which is not so easy to use. It would be better to have a nice export available to everyone, IMO. (updated)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Impressive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Ok I was writing since an hour from web app and when I clicked save than it got stuck on saving. I refreshed and whole data was erased. Complete waste of time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this it is the first journal I ever used but I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A wonderful way to memorialize special moments in your life with words and pics.i highly recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good to have more than 1 font color"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Professor x"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They CHARGE YOU WITHOUT YOUR PERMISSION!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When you don't use the app, make sure you fully unsubscribed! Your app won't show the status, the website won't show it...you have to find a special link I had to get from customer service to unsubscribe from a backdoor website. It was too late to avoid my credit card from being charged because there's no reminder prior just an email saying we charged you for another year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Fun way to journal. I love how this app works with the Bitmoji app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too many prompts to buy the premium version. Very good app otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to record a trip"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good companion in long journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it so far :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is perfect app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the experience!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I've tried a few and this is my favorite!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Way too many ingrained advertisements. You accidently click anywhere, and an ad pops up, telling you to pay an unreasonable amount for a locked feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used Journey for a long time now. It is stable, fulfills the function really well and synchronises with the Chrome version properly. I have tried another, but returned to Journey. ( 2017 entry ) Now it is April 2019 and I am still happy with Journey. My journal goes back to April 2015 on an almost daily basis and I am photographing earlier 5 year diary pages, a day at a time, going back to 1989. I still wish storage was optionally on the microsd for Android. Now it's July 2021 and A1"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app !!! I have access to it wherever I go. User friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, can use keyboard mic to speak your text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best thing for people who love to record their life's journey..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I don't have time to read or write any more and have tried to reach Journey to cancel my subscription. I hope you and others read this and help me find a way to cancel it before the next payment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app is ok but my low score reflects the terrible customer service. Despite turning off auto-renew I have been charged to renew an app that I no longer use, and when I tried to speak to the company about this they claimed they had no control over the payments which are taken by a separate company. They now have £20 of my money for a service I am not using and I am one very unhappy customer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't have this app any they just took 29.00 off my card an am trying to find information on how to get hold of this company to get my money back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Reliable. Love that you can attach files, photos, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Good at pinpointing events, activities or situations that impacts one's mental health."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app helps me keep track of things that have happened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just started using this diary. It seems easy to use and is pretty intuitive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well and reliably."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app around!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"look good but im not gonna pay for no dairy app .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Horrible, horrible customer service , I could see they are ""online"" but not doing anything at all !! They supposed to work from Mon- Fri but they first responded me on Sunday for a very short period of time, and goes slient Mon-Wed ! I tried contacting them daily and sent email multiple times but they ignored them all--- THEY ARE TOTALLY MINDBLOWING!! 🙄🤯🤯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still in love with this app two years later. It's now my best friend 😁. I always feel better when I enter here and pour out my heart. Thanks for making it an amazing experience app for me. 😍👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"What a complete bullschit app and POS developer. Apparently lifetime premium...(OSTENSIBLY AND LITERALLY) -WITH ALL FUTURE FEATURES- was a COMPLETE LIE. Now they want $89.99 A YEAR to be a 'member' ON TOP OF THE MONEY THEY ALREADY GOT THE FIRST TIME FOR GEE, I DUNNO, LIFETIME...??? I have encountered crooked developers, but these developers are extra special secret sauce con artist doucgebags of both the highest AND lowest order. EVERYTHING IS NOW ONLY TO NICKEL AND DIME EVEN EARLY SUPPORTERS!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This is a great app. I would rate higher but your remindered to buy a subscription a lot. But outside of that it's awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I recommend you try journaling. With the low price their offering you can take your journaling anywhere, personalize it, and really make it your own. I highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish it was all the way free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have enjoyed using this app but now I have a serious problem. Installing this app into a new phone and using my old account I discovered that many entries are missing. Specifically everything in 2020 and 2019. 2021 entries are there HELP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it !!! Pin protected so you can journal honestly without being worried someone will read it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Over priced. We'll I guess not for people who are struggling. If I wasn't struggling so much, I wouldn't need a journal app. 90$ is definitely price gouging. Like.... I can barely afford tampons.... 😩. Looks like I'll be taking the risk of someone reading my thoughts with a physical journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App looks user friendly.. But article can't store with categories.. Like poem, jocks, old history etc.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It lets my heart shed off its burden"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have this app long before I used it because I had to pay for it. But it doesn't really cost that much for a whole year and it has really been helpful especially over the last 18 months. Because I'm disabled I have to use speak to text and it works beautifully in this app and the app is so simple anyone can figure out how to do it. I have to admit I don't know why I didn't just Pony up the money earlier because it's cheaper than an actual book Diary. I completely love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy enough to use and I like the colours and interface very much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life is a test get right"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using daylio for several months already and it serves well. Thank you, Daylio team for such an awesome masterpiece."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ok App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's ok but too much prompts for membership it's annoying. Should have a setting to disable it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The best journal app (tried a lot of them) but no way to attach .heic (HEIF) images and also cannot attach videos over 200 MB. Could you add support for it, please? I really like that I can backup my journal with the images in original quality. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app makes me express my feeling like a social media post but in private. No pressure at all, only me and my journey app will know. 🧠🤳"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Advertises premium version too many times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've been a member for years and had purchased a premium lifetime membership and now they want a monthly fee. I feel like it was a bait and switch. On top of that, over the years it would, seemingly at random, delete my entries. So I'm ditching the app and looking for something better or at least more honest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"it was a great app in 2015, today not so much. I used journey for about 5 years and loved it, until I started using chromebooks. It works fine on PC's or your phone, but it will crash like crazy on your Chromebook. it especially liked crashing after you have written about 2 paragraphs ( so f^#kingfrustrating)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Customer service was very helpful in a silly issue I had with the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write in this a lot, but I don't publish. I use it for my own personal journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Need drawing features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great app, but way too many ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty nice. Ads are bearable in my opinion. I like that it syncs between devices and the atlas is a cool feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am like this aps. But not folder and category.please fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It still needs a lot of improvements."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ótimo app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome Awesome Awesome!! Love the app. Still havent used all the features but i love it. 🤗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really great!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really improved my life. It's the only app I've ever paid for lifetime premium for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app keeps prompting to rate this app even though I did. Changing the screen resolution from my Chromebook resets what I was wring. Lowering to 3 star."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stupid app. I want my money back you money sucking parasites!!!. I don't even want or need your stupid useless app. You force people to avail your subscription by using your stupid free trial. And when it ends, it the time you money sucker suck all our money to get your stupid subscription. Give my money back!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am trying to unsubscribe to this, but keep getting the run around"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app , thank u"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. Great help in recording and tracking your thoughts on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I need in a journaling app. Helps me keep focus, care for myself, and reflect on memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it but wish the whole thing was free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So much has changed so much over the past years. Track your mood, get coaching themed journal prompts, reflection, geo tagging, attachments, and so much more. Of all the cool features, my favorite is the ""this day a year ago."" Because what better way to celebrate your life than through reflection of your Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extremely amazing app❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not download it. As soon as the app downloads, a huge amount will be charged. Which can not be refunded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nothing amazing but easy to use and the reminder does exactly that, so I don't forget to make an entry. I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't keep prompting me to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stop spamming me with offers to subscribe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a good simple app for Journaling you also don't have to buy the subscription for basic features like the mood chart"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this easy to use app! It's perfect for my use. Im glad it's just a simple to use journal as it encourages me to use it daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Offre some future for free like font editing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love tht it's private, interface so cute."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its got almost everything you need. Love the tags and ability to work offline of you need to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The free version is pretty okay but I'd really appreciate it if I had an option to sort my entries in either ascending or descending order and if there was a favorites folder."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Mình sử dụng phiên bản free và hài lòng với các tính năng cơ bản mặc dù ad thường xuyên hiện ra. Điểm trừ là phiên bản premium quá đắt.!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app has been very therapeutic for me. Sometimes all I need is someone or something to talk. This app is great for keeping memories and getting things off your chest. It's only downside is that it costs money to get the full version but it works just fine without the premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Overpriced"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is as good as you are. It can't open and do the work for you. One can leave a little note for the day, or write a story. Hopefully it will help me develop good habits."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use...and above all, it can be used across device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My husband has been asking me for years to organize and label my pictures. I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just started. So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey makes cultivating a journaling practice easy and meaningful. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Very Handy. I write my thoughts and important stuff whenever i feel like. You can even Attach pictures with it which is very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Beautiful application. The ads are annoying though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its amazing! And when I switch phones or loose my account it is always easy to find! I love that!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works very well. It asks you to buy premium a lot, but it isn't too bad overall. I would definitely recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is good for keeping track of activities and for storing memories. I would love it more if more features were free, but still this is a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use, very convenient even for the free version, you are still able to access your journals on the desktop. I love how it saves your writings that if anything happens while you are typing, your journal is secured. I love that you can store pictures and videos on the journal even on the free version. I've used it for two years now and I have nothing to complain about."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A nice easy way of recording your events. I use it to record trips in my motorhome. It is grreat to add photographs and locations to look back on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very pushy onboarding that asks for purchases and yearly subscription commitments before allowing any tying out of app. Immediate turnoff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life-changing. Journaling is a very important pastime for a lot of people, and with good reason. Methods to consolidate information in the same place, easily accessible and safe forever. This app does just that, and it's changed my entire perspective on what life can be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pls comtinue your free services this thing is the only my friend that i can told all happening in my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do you have access to read our stored information?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app. I think the premium version would be awesome, but I don't like paying annually for software. They do have a lifetime version, buy it is nearly $100. I think $50 - $60 would be appropriate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal I've ever had. 50 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app makes journalling simple. I particularly love the notifications with reminder of past journal entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best writing app. Love the layout and design. New updates always makes it better. So far the BEST journal writing app! 💜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Aggressive prompts for subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful and handy as a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years and find it extremely useful. Great for looking back at memorable times and knowing the right time and place when they occurred."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish there was a a calendar view where you can see photos on the exact date. This is so I can view the month and see everything that's happened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"To me it is the ideal app for journaling. It's easy to use and the tags are easy to search. I have been using this app for many years. In my opinion, there is no other journal lingerie app that can beat this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is really a good App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app is so fun to use I write all my notes in it and what happens that day it is a perfect online journal! Five star ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Looks good so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Extremely aggressive prompts to purchase a subscription (which is extremely overpriced). The desktop app is fine with a reasonable one time payment, but nobody should be asked to pay upwards of $90 to have full access to a journaling app, no matter how good it is. I understand developers need to be paid but this is almost insulting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journalling. Syncs with desktop for easy use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Been using it for 2 years. Simple and easy to use. Able to store journal entries in a neat and organized way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I truly love this app. It's friendly environment convinced me to start writing entries into my journal more. Seriously, I love it. The only thing it is lacking is landscape screen orientation. Other than that, it's perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Automatic back up. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"it'd be so, so much better if the app stopped shoving the premium package in my face all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I started using it say for a week and than I saw that to backup/export option of my entries is available only for paid members. Uninstalling and shifting to another app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Devine experience to note important happenings with supportive photografs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for three years and I love it. It gives me throwbacks to read, prompts, lots of customization and options while keeping a clean interface. Really love the journey app. I'm a premium member bc they deserve the support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hello. Is the app nice and only stores your entries on the device? I think mine uploads the entries online by default in some format. If so: how could I delete the entries from the cloud? I usually write private stuff in a veracrypt conteiner. Is this somewhat as secure? In other words: is this app good enough for mafia or something?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, good looking, I can't see myself using any other journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"If you exit after writing a note it delets the note , this is very annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super love the app! I used to write in paper but lately I am having a hard time bleeding the ink into paper. This app helped me sustain journaling habit that I used to have"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this to get through a tough time. Being able to write down my feelings and day has really helped."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to add pictures to my posts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app makes it so easy to be able to track my thoughts, moods and everything. I hated journaling, but this makes it easier, kinda enjoyable!! Highly recommended!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, just I had a problem with my lifetime membership, I hope it can get solved quickly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a long time before all the upgrades, I was able to keep my entries and a piece of my mind on my phone which I LOVED, AND THEN my phone broke so i jus got it again n had all my entries synced over to a (older) loaner phone,.....but now that I got my new phone. A newer iPhone it's asking me to pay 30$ a month to be able to sync everything to the new phone cuz it's a different version of journey but same app! IF THEY SAY FREE IT SHOULD BE FREE ON ALL TYPES newer or older."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it it's that Best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Just figured out this program is most likely not developed in America. Not an issue but be careful to check the settings for temperature since the default is in metric and you don't want to surprise yourself. Also the ability to change the color of the font as well as additional font choices would be a plus. I'm a subscriber currently and not some freeloader."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Misleading. Won't disclose fee until downloaded and logged in. So I cancelled after my May review.. Two months later I was billed $89...No one is responding to emails...looks like I will have to fight this through my credit card company."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really like..but only 4stars because I think you should be able to have multiple journals..such as one for work..one for home life, ect. If it had that option I would give 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great free journal app. Free version has generous features and I can't think of any personal benefits to upgrading to the subscription option. App Allows you to attach photos to your journal. It also reminds you to journal when you haven't been active, this feature can be disabled As well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this app basic, nothing that stands it apart from other apps of it's kind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great diary/journal! I've been using it for years!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reminding me daily to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice App. Use it daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfect. Couldn't ask for better.😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I need. Been using it for over a year now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved this app but after buying a new phone I was unable to restore my lifetime membership. Support was no help keeps trying to say it's my own fault and pushing me to google play support even though I have confirmed with Google Play that there was nothing wrong with my account and google confirmed my payment record."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for a few years now and I absolutely love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for years. It has been what I've needed all these years as I moved on from a written journal one on my phone. It has gone through several phone changes and I have never lost anything. It is so worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey, it's true your life is an Journey which can be told in a journal. Subscription is something I experienced but I haven't even seen ads without it much, very impressed with that. This app allows you to save with a link email 📧account so you can never lose your valuable journal like a traditional one. So get to Journaling! The Journey awaits!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"been using for 4 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Always available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has always been helpful to reflect over any day I get around to journalung again. I still have entries that I recorded from 2017 even though I switched phones multiple times since then. I'd genuinely like to thank the creators for helping me store such memories and see how far I have come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a place where I can share my thoughts, my feelings, my plans, my experiences safely and privately, I can lock it with a pass code. It's stored in the cloud so I can access it anywhere, without being afraid if losing the data if I lost my phone. Love that we can add images, it goes well along with your thoughts. And I just started using the coach feature. Can't get enough of this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app for Journaling. Click. Pictures attached. Easy. It also gives weather, time, and location."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's nice to just hit the microphone and talk to journal how I'm feeling either on my way to work or on a walk. So simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy to operate app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has been my go to journal app and have been so happy to use this app and I also recommend it to my family and friends"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Changed my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"everything I ever expecting for digitalized memory. the app itself serves my memory, & using it ""by far"" gets my attention. I'm still my way for its subscription version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I re-found this app after 4 years and they kept all the journal entries from that long ago. It was really amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app! Helpse stay organized! Pretty easy to operate! Especially since I have android so I don't have the notes app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use, highly recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journaling app I have found.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is not done.. in the free version atleast the capability of bold, italics and ordered lists should be present.. all the fancy stuffs like heading, colors, themes could have been for subscribing.. highly disappointed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not install. Money-hungry. Does not even come close to other apps. I hate my experience in this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wow, even the night mode is for pro users. Amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App is not allowing to export our own personal data in any of the form which is ridiculous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Aweomse journal app that is so much more for many uses. Looking forward to see what changes may come. Been a solid part of my tool set for years as the best solution for more than a simple notebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Writing about yourself is probably a good positive way for using energy and time, when you write sth you force yourself to be clear about it and think it through. In addition to this increasing self-counciousness effect, with writing you can bring emotions under controll, seeking ways to deal with them or their causes. This app is user friendly, organanised and beautifull. I used it for a while and I'm considering doing that more often, trying to make a habit out of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, does everything I need it to do and does it well?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Simple. An autosave feature would be nice (sometimes I forget to press the tick)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The developers have done a great job fixing up some minor bugs and making it a more unified experience across platforms. I love the Coach feature. I keep my own personal diary and enroll in the Coach programs. It has been instrumental in my journey to improve my mental health. (Premium user)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for the last couple years. Overall very reliable, good set of features and easy to sync and backup the database."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice but would want a feature to allow handwriting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"My posts have not been saving properly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it any way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great format with a lot of info stamped to each entry like w Location to send weather. There are a lot of ad traps though. There should be a red flag or notify dot on the features you need an upgraded account for. You don't know until they are pitching their sale that the feature you were going to try is for upgraded accounts only. That could be done to make this journalling app a 5 star review from me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The amount of times I am asked to leave a review is annoying. Please reduce that, or implement the ask after some use of the platform. Aside from being met with that message every single time I opened the app (which most games don't even do) it's a pretty good app. Fun for leaving notes and takes into account details about the day in your time at the area, which is amazing for historical/nostalgia purposes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hard to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app from 2 years so far so good. Nice app to write about your life's beautiful events or create your own personal dairy. If you want your data as PDF formats or Docs format so definitely upgrade it or buy premium, the premium is very cheap, I suggest you buy the premium and enjoy. Thank you, Two App Studio Pte. Ltd."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very helpful and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app. It is easy to use. One comment or suggeation i would make is that i could combine the entries to create one document over a time frame. A hand written journal has this feature. I can turn back the pages. But the electronic journal does not work the same way. I have to go in and out of entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its so usefull app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I video tape journal when I don't feel like writing. Love it. Only app I've actually paid for!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for those short wrighting times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app ❤️😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far my favorite app to record all of life's greatest moments!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life long companion. Easy to to document and that's all I wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it since years now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and awesome it has a pass code so my journal is kept private. I recommend this app. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Update: great app. But I think they should b work with Google to figure out the privacy note that comes with the Google drive linking. It's still vague. Update: can you please confirm that you do not have the right to see edit files? It is a warning for all files. Not just the journey file Being informed by Google that there is privacy issue and that the apl ""See, edit, create and delete all of your Google drive files"" Can the developers please respond"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cant open the app, it's just closed everytime, I'm using a Samsung A50"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app. So easy to use ,user friendly without any disturbance of popping ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this..❤💯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I have been loking for in a journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good concept, works properly on my device 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good layout and easy to make entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is great! Keeping your notes, with pictures or a video clip is amazing! Hoping I can save more bright memories too. Thank you for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Giving four stars for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice place to keep your thoughts, lists, goals, etc.. Having a code to protect it makes it like your own digital diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The full version of this app is cheap and COMPLETELY worth it. It's easy to use, a nice clean interface that's aesthetically pleasing, and the picture and media function make it exactly what I'm looking for when I want to review my previous entries. I've always been the type to buy physical journals and planners and never stick to them. I'm not perfect now, I write about 3x a week entries but it's been consistent and I've felt the benefits of journaling and relaxing when I write during my day💝"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Predatory practice warning - this app will not allow you to export your own journal entries in bulk unless you pay them a subscription fee. Such a shame."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Need more education..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: it's 15 June 2021. I started using this app since 2016 until today. And today, I'm a productive coach. IG: coachinghabits. ""Reminders, logging and more, just way you need it. It's simplicity and ergonomic is more than you can expect. UPDATE: Truly helps you keep track whatever you need! Been using it for months now."""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive, great to record memories and nice reminder feature to prompt you to keep at it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal app that I can find in the PlayStore! It has everything that I need! ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Their website implies several persons can commonly edit a travel journal but this isn't true. The app doesn't sink well with the website version and they will not refund my money. Also, canceling the subscription is not easy where they send a code to your email and you have to enter it immediately else they don't accept your request."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary. It far better than Evernote app. Using past 5 years. Sync better than any other cloud sync diaries. Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good on day one....an update to follow are a using for a while"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Let's me keep track of where all my ime goes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not free for keeping a text lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App! My favorite Journal, and one of the best Journals (besides Journal It!) in Android history. I've been using this lovely App for both personal use and work purpose. I bought the Premium version several months ago for better experiences, and got satisfied by far. This App is really worth buying. • Requests: 1. Drawing/Doodle, 2. I hope the number of attached media can be increased for the Premium version. • Thank You very much! ツ👍🏻☕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years. Love the UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth the money, so many options and exactly what I was hoping to find in a journal app, definitely cool too look back on and reflect in personal endeavors"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool.. and an alive diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really love Journey dairy, reason being it allows us to store Audio, photos and even videos. However, I feel few features are missing, like adding photos from google photos and writing a diary in our own handwriting. Please try to include this feature as this is essential for a diary app. Also, auto sync (download) feature is missing, I have to sync manually on other devices if i upload any photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using the app for years, it's simply the best outhere! Simple, easy and convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app to keep track of my dreams and random thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good way of talking to yourself without being locked up. Has helped me self care."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I supported this app before with a lifetime purchase, but they then switched to a subscription model and now I can't use it on windows like how I used to. Even the web has huge banner ads for the subscription now. This discourages me from supporting this app further."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Real great journaling app, simple and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good reliable and handy application. Data easily retrievable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love It!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the free parts only and am very happy with it. I can jot down notes, my thoughts and any thing I want to keep."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Kako je na računu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"i use it but the premium is so bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helps me keep track of my mood, feelings, and activites"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You need to pay it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's OK"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a delightful appl visually attractive and full of journali g features anyone would love. The image however on the lower bar when doing entries sets off amber alerts and looks suspicious. Otherwise the appl is a dteam."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Soo far soo good,i paid for premium, but not sure what that includes...yes i like this app heaps its great the way you can save pics n vids,,.Over the last few Years ive got quite a diary here..Very good to look back.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had written some stuff and saved it here..i lost my phone but got everything i wrote intact when i logged from new phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"7 day free trial no thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, conveniently placed on all my electronics for use anytime and syncs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Im very pleased with this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like how I get daily notifications so it kind of reminds me to journal daily. It will be interesting to read through my thoughts now a few years from now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A good app for Journaling. Unfortunately there is no way to choose the cloud service where I can sync my data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Smooth experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing diary. I haven't been much of diary keeper but this app certainly changed my mind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautifully designed App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"5 bucks a month for a word processor. Ahem..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It bothers me that I can't managemy subscription either in the app nor desktop or Google play store. Paid for annual subscription. Still I want to have the option to change at any time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recently purchased the premium, yet limited, version for Android because I don't need all of the extras that come from the full premium version. All I need is to bold, italicize, and underline. Since then, I have been using and enjoying the app more than I did with the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Bad experience after year 2017. I already have premium for Android app for years, however, currently, formatting from tollbar when saved on android app, and opened on chrome app, it showed html content instead of markdown. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Intuitive. A bit expensive but love that it had a discount to start with. Thank you for the great work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this for a couple of different reasons, both keeping life notes but also because writing things down to read over to help my memory through rough patches. The online sync, the ability to edit notes, dates and times. It's perfect for making a life journal. Couldn't ask for more... Maybe, dark mode? Ah! In paid mode 🤣"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the only diary I use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great application for the diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it's so user friendly. It's really everything I need and want in a journal app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just a nice app to use and keep my memories fresh"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like the recall of previous 3 year's events. I wish you connect this to my Google appointment book and remind me of my appointments here"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Upon attempting to open the app the first time, the load stops and Devs want to force you to accept a coupon for 50% off premium before youve even finished opening the app for the first time let alone at least allowing a single journal entry. If you pass on the offer it's void when you dismiss the Popup. So, I uninstalled immediately without using the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app in general but please fix the bug that it doesn't save entries when you make an entry by pressing the notification that reminds you to journal. I just wrote so much and even recorded a full video but none of that was saved and it's lost forever now. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"smooth to use, clear to see and doesn't get in the way when I want to brain dump."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hopefully, there will be more features available"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! 6 stars out of 5! I can say whatever I need to! I can keep track of my growth as a person! Best of all its private!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💕💕💕💕💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm so thankful for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I got a new phone and now my lifetime purchase is gone. I'm not spending the money twice. I have had this week over a year and no longer have the receipt that is demanded to restore my purchase. So now all my Journaling is just lost!???? Such bs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app for keeping inspirational quotes and advice I hear. I also record sweet texts and emails from my kids and family. I want to scrapbook them for posterity some day. I wish I could give 4.5 stars. The editing process is weird and it's still difficult to share/ send, etc. I get security, but..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. I also ignore the advertising and premium offers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is a good and easy to use app..Trust me you will not get dissapointed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"need also folder view option when we open app please provide options in setting to see"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good. Simple and effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the suggestions, thought provoking coaching that sometimes take me in a direction I didn’t intend to go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good journalling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for recording anything, as well as keeping track and tracking items. Update 5/2021 This app is awesome. Note only has it be great these past years, I updated to the premium version and never looked back. Anything you need to note of keep track of, this is it. Look into this before looking of even thinking of the others. GB"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everyone should definitely have this app..it's good and reliable enough..and safe and has good back up thing aswell... definitely recommending this app😌😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Really love it already and I just installed it. I love that you can add pictures and time and date without having to write it yourself. So easy to use!! I purchased the premium and I am so hooked! It has been 5 years and I still use it and love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have more success journaling with journey than keeping a physical one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Excellent journal write I can see my daily progress and dairy in this .however please fix the bug When I open this app with my new Mac book M1. It's crashing more often hope you can fix this 😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years for my poetry and have never lost any of it, it has never failed me. I trust it with my most important words."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Zero support response, support agent has ""been away"" for over a year now. Opaque subscription billing policies; I purchased a lifetime license a year ago, yet was billed for annual service a year later. Privacy concerns; personal data is stored on Google servers, without transparency into how the data is used which brings up privacy concerns for a personal journal product. I'd stay away until the app makers become a little more responsive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"New Review after 2.5months GET APP CHEAPER READ If you like this app as much as I do, do yourself a favor & buy the LIFETIME subscription 1 TIME FEE OFFER (about $85) FOR LIFE! NO MORE $29 YEARLY FEES! New: Review after 3 months of use I can't tell you how much I'm enjoying this app!! It is a lot like sharing on Facebook, but you can keep it for your own records. I can share & copy any link straight to this app. The app only allows 10pics per entry, but u can have many entrys each day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this. It's simply an electronic diary but I like that you can add a pic of how you feel each day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very good and helpful app 👍👍. I love it so much ❤️❤️."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a decent journaling app, but when I first bought it, they offered a ""lifetime premium"" option which I purchased. This advertised giving you all the benefits they offered at the time. So I had no issues using the web version or anything like that. Now that they've discovered a way to get money every month, my benefits are harder and harder to sync and I get ads ALL the time which is incredibly frustrating when you've already purchased."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, has hastags that help to find previously written stuff that you could be looking for. No functionality issues. Ads are minimal, or I just don't notice them. Love this app and use it regularly. Also has a password option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm able to jot down quick thoughts I have during the day. And it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ease to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can someone plz help me password reset? It's not there I guess. I can't open my app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a very good tool to track your daily experiences. One very important feature that I like is that the app gives notification about any stories that have been logged. For e.g. if I logged any activity on 21st May 2020, it will give a reminder on 21st May 2021..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using Journey for at least 5 years now. It's my go to app for thoughts, notes, poetry, quotes, reminders, grocery lists. It's easy to get to, keep safe and go back to and read again. Huge plus, the free side of it is wonderful. It's a part of my everyday!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that tends to get out of your way so you can focus on what matters...you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app, but the advertising is slightly annoying, especially given that I managed to pay for OSX version. I hoped that would have saved me from it, alas it wasn't true. Kindly tone down the campaign, this is not what I want to see popping up, when I am seeking for a place to pour my soul out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a really good app. Even the basic features are really good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app I've found"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Subscriptions are confusing, customer service sucks and the ""absolutely no refund"" policy is ridiculous. But it is a good product. I'm just not sure if it's worth the money if you pay for a subscription in full (I made the mistake of not canceling it before it automatically renewed so now I'm stuck with it for another year)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Was a paper based journal writer, but decided to try digital. So far, a great experience and will likely remain a digital journal keeper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the app I dont like the adds but I tuned em out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is sooo gorgeous.... I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Free for a week. Cool. Not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Probably great before. Can't upload videos from gallery. Doesn't upload videos I record on the app. Mistakenly trusted it to eventually upload since it had the loading screen. 10 minutes later it uploaded everything except the long video I recorded. Waste of time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Basic functions are good. I didn't subscribe to the membership so some features are limited such as text editing (using bold or italics) and adding titles to the entries. These are kind of essential to me and it's kinda odd for these features to not be available for free users. So this limits my usage of the app for notes only and I would much rather rely on Google docs for detailed journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Gooooood"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best companion in my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Of course the option to cancel subscription has to be dodgy and buried in a place that nobody knows. This attitude should be illegal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this daily...very simple, straightforward journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to journal. Easy to use and locked with code so you can keep your journal private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it. Wish it had more features like daylio"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extremely straightforward and easy to login/use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not much to it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exciting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actually love this app. Just picked it back up again after a few years. I need the daily journal entries at the moment. Great that I could import my data from Dalio! So handy! Thank you Devs!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using the free version of this app for a long time. Never have any problems (except maybe that they never stop asking if you want to upgrade 😅). Seamless between mobile and web apps, I love this journal!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Something that keeps me sane in this troubling time. Though I cant afford the life time membership, I'm glad this free version allows me to write my thoughts out. Thank you for this wonderful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app. I have used it for years to keep my journal. I like that I can include photos, and you see a glimpse of it without having to open up the entry. It is easy to use. What I don't love is: 1. The constant request to upgrade. It's annoying. 2. I can't save non photo attachments (e.g. pdf, word, etc.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, backed up and clean ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had a few technical difficulties at first, but Mary from customer service was fantastic! I would highly recommend based on her support alone!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A fun and inspiring app! I wish you could do bold, italics, etc. without paying. Same also with the backup feature, so you wouldn't have to worry about losing everything. (I lost all my old entries because I got a new phone!)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app it is especially helpful that it has a lock feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to write it allday and note interesting situation in my journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app because it's user-friendly and really helping with journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've tried so far. Probably not gonna switch to anything ever. I'm seriously happy with this. Just all I want!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app is good but it's need more choices to sign in , gmail and apple id"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app is too expensive considering you have to pay for EVERY platform you want to use it on. I bought lifetime premium on mobile but I can't use the desktop app or view my stuff in a web browser past the last 5 entries. And the web browser and desktop app are TWO DIFFERENT purchase plans. So I'm out. Also this app sucks for copy / pasting stuff out, everything becomes double spaced for some reason."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it .simple and easy my style"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like so far, great journal.... This app deserves even more than 5 stars ✨ it has been so helpful to me and very therapeutic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the idea of linking all your journalling from your phone to your computer. Keeps everything in one place. Journey is a safe place to express how I truly feel. Much love to journey from this introverted HSP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Secret Diary foryou Review and feel the ""nostalgic"" sensaction :') essential to any jorney that you are making =D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!! 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Pretty good journaling app, but I don't use it much because of the constant popups and ads getting in the way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love all the features of this app. Even though I don't pay for the premium thing this app is great! Changing fonts, colors, you can add tags to your entries so you can sort through them easy. I wish you could add more than one video for each entry but everything is still great. Best app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well I opted for the lifetime subscription ,and so far I'm not dissatisfied. However I am troubled by some of the technical issues it seems to have performing some of the extras that it's supposed to be able to with the upgraded subscription, because for the most part it seems glitch out on me ,but still even with all that I am still very pleased with the over all service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to capture life moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this App🙂! It has a push reminder to reminds me each day to write in it. I can make different tags and I use them for different journals. Like my regular diary, a diary for gratfulness, my diet thoughts etc. It's a good and very useful App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Very useful for both journaling and mood tracking, but premium content feels too impersonal to be much use. Seems best in conjunction with a professional therapist to tailor journaling to your own needs rather than the somewhat generic prompts from the journaling courses the app offers. Maybe helpful for those with milder issues who don't yet need a therapist yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I Can't Download My Photos Back, Pls Help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I hope to make the best of this app for the year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and does the job. Like the coaching corner"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Really allows me to organize notes and ideas efficiently"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Requires paid subscription to export data"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Having a digital diary with so many amazing features allows me the leisure to write whenever and wherever I want because a) my tab is always with me b) I do not constantly need to search for a pen Plus my thoughts tend to flow easier for some reason. I really love Journey. It's like I unconsciously have to write on it everyday now because, it's so easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great way to journal regularly. To be add pics and other documents also helps keep everything in one place. The coaches and programmes are a nice bonus, just some things to get you thinking. I would recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is honestly a great app, and as someone who has always struggled with any kind of journaling or daily check-ins, it has been very useful. The one issue i do have is that if i record and upload videos in the app, there's some sort of glitch half the time where my video disappears, never to be seen again. This can be very frustrating when I decide to do a video entry rather than type it out. But other than that it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is user friendly amd I have been keeping up with my journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Decent app, unable to be used unless you pay for it though. Couldn't even get the free trial without paying first."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Cumbersome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the goods wen it comes to keepung a diary. Recommended 100% if ur on a personal journey. This is the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No doubt that this is the best app for daily note and personal diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"keeps in sync all the data even if you haven't used it for a while. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had few weeks I REALLY needed to express myself in journal form. This app was perfect. Zero complaints. Thanks to the dev team. Yes, it CONSTANTLY tries to get you to upgrade, but the dev needs to eat. I get it. Still 5 stars. Yes, many features are locked behind the paywall, but the core features are free and work exceptionally well. I wish the lifetime fee were lower, but as I said before: the dev needs to eat, too. At least it's not forcing ads on the user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'd appreciate some improvements (such as including public transit as a travel option, especially 🚉 train!)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"bellesima"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really wonderful, there isn't a thing I don't like about it, easy to use and really cute, just amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved this app. I am having a very good experience with this app. This is my journal which is safe with me 24×7. 👌👌👌 Thankyou for this app 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Looks free but have to pay for membership to use .But other then that looks pretty good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not good! I had about 27 entries over the past 2 years of my girls taking horse riding lessons, with pictures and everything. I changed phones and lost half of that. I paid for the lifetime premium service, and got robbed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice stable journaling app with solid performance and useful sync/export/media attachment options. I would like the option to NOT have abstract shapes in the preview tile of annual memories, please. Thank you. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Recent update appears to have removed the ability to record my exercise data (premium user) via Google Fit integration, with no warning of the same."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"IT IS SO GOOD!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app very much. Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A1 brilliant."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't reccomend I honestly don't know how this app has a high rating There are diaries so much better than this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hated everything about this app, the user interface is childish and I never got the impression my entries were secure. The prompts were stupid and for some reason set up like a video game? As in, tap when ready to begin and tap to continue but it's just a journal entry, why 3 steps? Had to sign in with Google and could never sign out, ever. Also, my battery started draining constantly as soon as app was installed. I had to cancel the subscription and uninstall the app to make it stop. $ wasted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use perfect for what I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's my favorite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect. would be great to have handwriting option- Then I could use it in my samsung Tablet with S pen. Any possibility in future?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi.update on the debt, i think u should put ""clear option"" for wallet to allow people to know that it is not compulsory to choose a wallet for the debt. Cos it takes time to do everything again if people accidentally chose that / didn't know that no wallet opt actually exist (only if u don't chose any wallet at first). Other than that, all are great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent and flexible"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I can write on my phone, tablet and even my computer. No matter where I can get all my stuff out. Even my therapist says it's the best help for my anxiety and depression."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this to store personal information and to store journal entries banking everything absolutely love this application! I would highly recommend signing up for it like I did and it's such a great price I only paid like $25 for a year of service That's amazing! I would not use this unless you pay for the membership. it isn't an app that should be free and that is why you have to PAY for the AMAZING FEATURES!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovingly Unconditionally always eternally."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I love the way I'll be composing an entry and if I switch to a different app and then back, everything I had entered will be discarded and I start over from scratch (just kidding, I hate it)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Poor sync options on upgrades... So I PAID (this would be MONEY I earned... something these app developers treat lightly) for the Premium only to find out that the Premium upgrade essentially means NOTHING!! The Premium upgrade doesn't apply to me using it on my laptop?!? I'm now being hounded to become a 'member' with a monthly fee. Not happening. I'll just create my own method of journal keeping without all the money draining fees!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal App!! I have been using it to keep track of my life and plan things out for over 5 years and can't ask for more, this app won't disappoint for people who want a clean style Journaling 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mumtaz mumtaz"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Whoops digging into the reviews. Yikes, seems like a mulberry grab"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"You could stop asking me to rate you and post a review almost everytime I open the app. I have done so a few times. Very distracting!! Good app overall, lots of neat features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app. Edit: I still use this app in 2021"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have kept a journal for over a year now. Easy to use and refer to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such an easy app to use. I lost a phone and was able to continue journalling on my computer while I waited for a replacement. When I got my replacement phone all of my previous entries loaded without issue."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app for a while now and it's been working well. I like the fact there is an online version too so I can type on my laptop too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Please add archive option. I meant an archive option to archive entries so they are hidden and placed in the archive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a very great app only the ads are quite frequent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had an issue with android premium package. Support responded within minutes and resolved my problem.. Nothing to say. Just perfect. Loving the app. 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All time favourite app for my online diary for years Very intuitive app and assessible by browser as well ... With many additional features, making it more enjoyable.. Though would be better if there is an option for more wallpapers imo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User Interface is good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bug. When i create new tags while compose new entry, suddenly my writing is gone. I have to write again, back to square one. Pls fix this issue. It is better if the writing can be autosave while we still in writing it. I paid for this app and i feel so stupid."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"All my data has lost ...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My comfort zone💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not ready to give this app a 5 star as I haven't had enough time to use it and I didn't have an option to ""rate later"". Everything is functioning well so far I just don't know how I will find everything and I don't understand the system yet. Looks like I enter as many entries as I want but I don't know how to categorize them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool though the ads suck a little"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, Pretty and Productive app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"What a lovely app. Visually appealing, clean, simple, easy to use and navigate. I've tried a number of journaling apps and this is the nicest to use. Well, this was 4 years ago. Now?Avoid this developer! Ridiculous price hikes, misleading promotions, zero support for long-time users, and a cavalier attitude about a paid users' concerns."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app makes me like journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using Journey helps me keep an online diary where I express my thoughts, both negative and positive. It helps me release my negative energy through writing. It helps me energise myself and keep memory of all the beautiful experiences I would like to remember."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app works ok but will bombard you with ads for upgrade even after you buy membership. Also they try to force you to give a 5-star review. They literally block the app with ""Give us 5 stars. Be generous."" banner with no way to close it or click away."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app for taking journal. Simple and clean layout. Easy to search."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice App. Scheduler, or you can set as reminder."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy interface, great back up system, and I love the tags to categorize my entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good GUI"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me process and document my experiences in full coflnfidence"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good place to write down your thoughts. I don't use it as much as I should but it is easy to use and has some good features like a coach to help you get better at writing things down. 4/25/21, have been using daily for a couple of weeks now, the daily reminder feature is good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good overall. Available on all platforms"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I couldn't us this unless I pay. I have a pen and paper and it could do exactly what I need it to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Useful and helpful. I tried many other app but this is very excellent. Many features are making this app very helpful.Thanks and make more better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When I tap on return, it doesn't auto save the work, for older version, it would, hope this can be fixed, thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app. I use it every day. One thing I would like to suggest is the app switch the positions between the check ✔️ mark used for saving and the trashcan 🗑️ used for deleting. Most people are right-handed, whilst the saving is used more often than deleting. It has been a few months already that I have been using this app, but still unable to adjust, I almost delete things I record, every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So user friendly with a great layout. Simple and easy! Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE THIS APP. ITS MY PERSONAL BFF TO RANT AND VENT WHENEVER I NEED!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love, love the app. All my entries still intact after three years with my head on the block."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the friendly reminders when I forget to make a journal entry. I'm able to attach videos another great feature. I asked the question below, and within an hour I had an answer emailed to me! And I can sync this with my tablet by going to the Journey website. Happy Camper here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice to use. Even for free users. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app and great customer support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app to get all my thoughts in one place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can't edit date and time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have this app on my ipad and it's fantastic. The only thing I would like is more options to customise things like the font etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good at what it does but constantly asks to rate and upgrade to premium which gets really annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app on the market"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for a few days. So far so good. Whish there was a way to create multiple seperate journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app subscribed me directly, i didn't use it i wanted a refund but nobody answers!!! Please send my money back. Update: hello 2months still no answer. I subscribed mistakenly, didn't use the app. Please send my money back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has changed my life. It's nice being able to journal through speech-text!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for life ☺️😂😂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the way the app syncs to the computer! I can write anywhere! I am still using the free version as I want to be certain I will write everyday before I buy. That being said, I wish the free version had different fonts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For my basic needs, (tracking daily workouts at the gym) it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Helpful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it have had it for years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Incredible fast support reply. And it's actually on point!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Features and experience were designed well, so even if there can be so many things that can happen on the app - it's not overwhelming at all. I like the simplicity and how easy I can use it. I like the fact that I can also view my stats, and the mood chart is really helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my favorite must have apps! I love the tagging ability and calendar view. I love being able to include pictures so easily in my posts. And what I really love is that my data is backed up to my Google drive, so I can open my entries from anywhere- cloud, desktop, phone. It's what I needed to make meaningful entries possible in my life, and I recommend this app whenever I get a chance. Tagging and searching for entries based on tags makes this practically useful in all aspects of my life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I like that I can add pictures and emojis if I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why don't you just maKe it a paid app directly so we don't have to worry ourselves You cant write with a stylus on a free version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it🤩🤩🤩"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for at least 5 years. It has changed my life. Made me realize that I AM a WRITER."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic Application - Pro Version Lives Up To Expectations This is the journalling app you want. Download this one. I have used this for years and its top notch. Keep it up dev team!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You need to pay for everything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Great for keeping daily notes and updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really brilliant journalling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great simple app to do what you need it to do. Great that it is cross platform and that you can save the data to Google drive so that when your open it in another device, all your posts are updated and available for your view. Works for both ios, pc, and android. So I can write anywhere with any device I have at hand."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great for keeping personal stories and experiences. Easy to add pics and GPS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better then paper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app to record my thoughts and feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app's concept is really good and I have been using it for more than a year now, but they have started reducing the upload limit for free users which is really very bad. Also they have increased the yearly subscription and lifetime fees which is unacceptable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Takes 3 clicks on two different sides of the screen to add a tag, really ? Minus another star, location picker is now useless.. Needs a timeline feature badly, to see 20, 30, 50 years at a glance. A way to add entries for just a year, for when exact dates aren't known. Add people to entries with contacts lookup and auto tagging."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I don't like this app because of its not free app and it require 4200rs for subscription it's to much expensive I don't want to pay otherwise I request to Google if any app are here in play store that are not free you must be mentioned on the top of the screen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sans the annoying reminders to upgrade, even the free version is pretty functional"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall the app is great just wish I could export the information to allow me to easily print it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app and how easy it is to use. I can keep track of moments, days, dates and how the day made me feel with such ease. I really am glad that I found this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I want to try it but have questions? It says in the informatin that I have to allow external access to my journal writings or recordings and share them. I can't understand why my private journal entries would need to be seen by anyone, whats the point in having a pass word or finger print lock to protect my privacy if strangers on the outside looking in can see everything. Maybe I miss understood what it ment so I am asking before I install. Thank You, Lisa"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for a while now and it's nice to have a journal that I can use on a whim anytime anywhere the only suggestion I have is that the process of transfering the entry from my phone is a little difficult, I'm not sure if that's a premium feature or not, but for some reason even though I paid the premium feature isn't showing up. Once this is fixed I'll re-rate all and all, this app is amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I don't like how most of the things on this app need to be paid for. That part was hidden before I downloaded it. It may very well cause me to find another app that's genuinely free and I can use offline."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. I bought the full version as I use it couple of times a day, To keep a record of my son's work as he's home ed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved this app. I'm using for long time one of the best app to manage Money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great APP the interface is smooth"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After you set everything up do they tell you that there is a MONTHLY CHARGE.!!!! Later for that..!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After years of using, even without taking advantage of their premium services, Im still able to use it without a problem and ensured privacy. Thank you. Hope that I will still be able to enjoy the service for the next coming years. You've been reliable and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Use it everyday, really cool. Can you add the option to provide headings to entries? It'll be really helpful. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You can get a lot out of the free version; my needs are minimal at this point in my life though (I'm old). Good U/I design, to my tastes. Tags, mark-up, other attachments are implemented well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Meets all the journaling needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, comfortable, helpful. I recommend this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice Journey diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for my anxiety. I'm able to use words towards how I feel. ❤️ Love it Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal. I can post my most intimate thoughts and it will follow me from phone to phone. I can have until I'm no longer in this world. Awesomeness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for journalling. Only downside is you have to buy separately for iPad ( iOS) and Android devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Today Download"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is packed with the basic features that you could think of utilizing in a digital diary. 5 star since you can use it for free!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Won't accept transfer of data from MEMORIZE Journaling App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App requires purchase just making text bold are you crazy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really great , I hope that it can have drafts that I can make so I can't type some sentences every day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"dark mode should be free since dark/light mode are accessibility tools, people like myself who are medically sensitive to bright light can't use this app without having to pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty awesome! I've been using it for years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"things are good, somethings i probably haven't checked out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app that I have been using for the last year and it is so private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Optional vw to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'd like if you could make the background picture one from your camera roll instead of the impersonal ones offered. Also if you could attach videos to entries, not just photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hi, my account is premium but the app keeps telling me to become a member. furthermore, it restricts my privileges like adjusting fonts. please fix this. I am a paying customer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love writing down my thoughts and this is a perfect platform for me to do so"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it allows me to journal on the go. I have a password set so it is also totally private. It's easy to use and I can make it so much more personal adding photos and locations. It is great and can be used for different things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's private. Allows you to save videos and photos and journal everything. It helps for me to get out what is bottled up. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life Membership status. Re-review. Journey wins the award for visual ease and function. The ability to go into Gallery and select a pic from 2 years ago(up to 10) and retain geo location is an awesome feature, with other apps I fumbled trying to recall the date - Journey does it for you. Because of this, I keep location active at all times. So I can go to Laredo, then Buttonwillow CA, fumble over to Gallop New Mexico and stack up on silver at the Indian res store and build my Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journaling app I have ever come across 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, great tool. Having your journal/diary with you in your phone wherever has been a game changer. I also love having the ability to attach documents and pictures. I sometimes find quotes that correspond to my entry for that day and it makes it perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have notes all over my phone about the day. Now I have a place to keep them together."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great tool to use as part of my wellbeing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It's easy to use and saves other information like the local time of your entry if you are traveling. It also geo-tags youe entries on a world map along with the number of entries so you can revisit your thoughts by clicking on them. It then opens your entry. No searching for dates to find the entry you made while on vacation."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! Have been using for 4 years and has never failed me. Syncs everything to the cloud and also has these awesome 'flashbacks' to the same day a year ago. It's nice to know what I was doing a year or more ago at this very moment. Thank you so much!! I'm not exaggerating when I say that this app has made such a great impact on my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! It's definitely helped me consistently keep a journal for the last week... Am hoping this will continue! Love that I can upload photos too, just wish you could upload a video with photos in the same entry!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and convenient to use on mobile. To track thoughts and reflections, this is key."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too many ads & sales pitches- uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always the best journaling app. Free version has done me well. I have used straight for about three yrs now, and still my go to.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love getting the prompts to remind me to make a journal entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great little app for keeping track of your day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant for keeping you positive and reflecting what is good in life. I think it's been really good for lockdown. I've had this for maybe 18 months"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app, even bought it, but now all they want to do is so me premium. It's annoying. Uninstaller and moving on to something else."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No user friendly ! Only about Money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy using this app I have paid for a year but I'm still trying to figure out the app cuz it says it does alot for you but I dont know what yet Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A smooth experience. I've only been using Journey for a couple months, and it is my first journaling app. I am still exploring all of the features but from the items I have used the application is quite smooth. It certainly makes the act of making an entry easy. I'd appreciate the ability to have multiple journals, but i am making do with the tag feature to collect groups of entries which works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too complicated for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THIS APP IS AWESOME. IT ALLOWS ME TO PUT MY THOUGHTS DOWN IN SECRET....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an awesome app. Helps me a lot doing my journaling . Regards"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😘"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Want free only sry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really helps me in remembering stuff that I forgot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Need to put more features open from subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"My first diary app, was recommended by reddit. I like how the app looked, the functions. It honestly really great, they're 5 stars rating. But the constant pop up of Premium and asking me to Rate the App is really obnoxious. No button to Rate Later or even close the Rate pop up (You can use back button on your phone to close it, but it will come back later) The constant premium pop up every day is annoying as well. I liked the app but sadly I have to find a replacement."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, quick, simple. Passcode protected. Private. Perfect 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very easy to use and very helpful. It's my online diary and helps me in reflecting on my life and actions and thoughts in better ways."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has been with me for a while. Today's my birthday and when I took the picture of my cake I realized how helpful this app has been. Nice ui, dark mode, never lose anything, track of my trips, moods, and suggestions. So, thumbs up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Journey for all my poetry. I love this journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I searched for notebooks and this appeared I downloaded it and see no books to write something so it's not for making notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Free trial"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this. I love journaling and had stopped. This takes it to the next level and I journal all day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. One of the best of its kind. I'm reviewing my rating above for this app because of its penchant to ask Lifetime Premium users to upgrade, badgering Premium users with ads. I emailed, reported this issue but they still can't fix it. Premium users have to uninstall and reinstall to get around this issue all the time. Edited 30 March 2021 - Issue fixed by developer. Can't do without this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how you can save stuff online and it's locked so no one can see it. Using this app is very therapeutic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wow!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very effective way to get to know more about yourself and others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping memories, notes and big ideas that come to me randomly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used Journey for 1523 days, and I love it. I use Journey to write journal for my little sons, it keeps our memories and reminds us through ""throw back"" every month, every year... One suggestion that Journey should have embeded and playback for youtube url or other video channels inside the app, as storing video in google drive should not be the only option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use, the best journal app i could find anyway."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's simple and easy to use. I've tried other methods, but I keep conning back to it. Definitely a keeper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app. Only one I've ever enjoyed using as someone that doesn't write diary entries often. It's a good place app to vent and go back and realize things weren't as bad, or reflect on bad past decisions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"app just gets better and better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Finally removed it. Got tired of TINY TEXTS on macbook. Synced entries from mac don't SHOW-UP on android I mean, they do sync but unless I edit>type something in them from android onlt the time is shown without opening them (no text, nothing) which is very frustrating Font change, color change, heading size etc Everything requires a premium, take away photos, tags everything but font size? DIARIUM IS THE BEST CROSS PLATFORM JOURNAL APP AND SHOULD BE EDITOR'S PICK HANDS DOWN!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I dey gbádùn am."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient app for journaling food intake, thoughts, etc. Not restrictive with pre-assigned fields. Just track what you want, when you want."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LOVE IT"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sync not working. Tried everything including uninstalling profile"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app has an annoying subscription model that serves no purpose other than to squeeze lots of money out of users. Other than that, it's well-designed. But I guess you have to pay the bills somehow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple easy to use with good search function"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it. Just a few things that I think could be better: When selecting any new options in the settings, the screen loads back to the settings page; Movement is automatically added which can get a bit annoying because I don't want to add it every time!; I'm often locked out more than I need to be when navigating through the app, I wish it would save my spot! Also a cool recommendation: media with time stamps/time legend would be so awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Life time Price is too high please reduced it so poor people buy this like me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Now it doesn't sync entries correctly on mobile and desktop apps. Going to be switching to another service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for recording our travels"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wish I was able to see on the map where places are."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am still learning what this app can do but I am definitely a fan."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've come to rely on this app for all sorts of journaling, keeping track of meetings, goals that I want to achieve, random thoughts and personal observations, and best of all I can access the journal entries on my phone, computer, and tablet thanks to the easy sync system. Definitely a great app for productivity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't use it often but I want to. I'm new to journalling and this makes it super easy. Love the password feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient diary,and still using it in 2021"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been my best friend some days! It is so easy to use and it even brings back memories which is great because I use this for material for future books I'm writing. Totally recommend this APP!👐🏾👏🏽👏🏾👌🏾"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so why do I have to tap edit to delete an entry?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It was okay, I was able to write an entry and enter my mood, etc. It only seems to work on my sister's phone and not on my chromebook. If they fix this problem I will happily return."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for a long time and now I can't access anything. It keeps kicking me out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app has started crashing when attempting a new entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Crashes on adding new record. Need urgent help!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It takes alot of time to load and that's really annoying when you are in a hurry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great layout and pretty easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My only problem with this app is that If u press enter, then write a letter, then delete the letter, the app will put you back at the previous line (as if the enter did not exist)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is my first experience with journaling and I love it! I may not journal every day but on day I do, it feels really good and provides some clarity on anything I may be feeling. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DONT USE THIS APP!!!! This company did the ONE unforgiveable thing! It destroyed my data!! A couple years worth. What's worst of ALL is they have got the UNMITTIGATED NERVE to keep me subscribed to a pay plan! It is ABSOLUTELY UNCONTIONABLE that these HORRIBLE people would be SOOO worried about data that they would do this! Undertsand, if you do not jump through RIDICULOUS hoops that ARE NOT explained, it WILL happen to you! i hope you read this Journey people! YOU are the ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!! If I could give you a NEGATIVE rating I would!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"New"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great cloud based journal app. Does what it says it does"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Writing in a journal is so important, this platform is easy and awesome because of the pictures you can save with it. It's so important to write and reflect. I've learned that from Jim Rohn."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good to use and i enjoy using to write!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great nice simple interface, good with images and lists"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Journey's backup system needs a little work. I lost a lot of videos and posts from 2020 and if you're doing a diary that should be #1 in importantance. I still love the app but all the bells and whistles don't matter once your phone is out of space for videos and etc. I'm just telling you guys what I wish I would've known."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A really nice app that works on mobile and desktop (including Linux). Where I can just write down my thoughts every day. Very meditative and relaxing. Better than keeping it all in my head. Thank you, developers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like to journal. I feel that it helps me in so many ways. I did all these for self-improvement and to remember. Just one thing I would like to point out. The activities. Theres not much to choose from. Stationary, eating, walking. Not much. You need to add more. Theres room for improvement. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great experience but membership fees high"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can we get our stuff after u installing the app and then reinstall? How to login and logout?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What a great app! 👏👏👏👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I need and want in a journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool journaling app. Worth trying out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ease of this app. Also appreciate that I can use it from my laptop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased premium membership 3 yrs ago for rs. 320, to enjoy extra features. Now they have introduced new category called ""lifetime premium"" to earn money, which is very expensive, Rs 8k lifetime. On web app, it says 'You're using free version' which is totally i justice. They have also restricted features in my premium account. Hated this policy. You shouldn't affect previously taken memberships. Sad. Downgrading to 1 stars. Hate this monetory policy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. Been using it for years. It doesn't crash. Has a mood tracker. Can be accessed through laptop. So many more features. This is PERFECT."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Literally the best writing experience I ever had. It's just fab"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used this app years ago when I was going through a lot and needed to get my feelings out. I have a new therapist who encourages me to write. After 2 months my beautiful new journal is practically empty. I just can't seem to get into the practice. Then I remembered this app and downloaded it. I can't believe they kept my entries from 6 years ago! It was incredible reading them. This app is essential for me now. I can write on my phone, computer, anywhere and not worry about finding my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"New to the app, but loving it so far. I think I may pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've learnt a lot about myself when I started to journal. I've definitely been able to track my mood and work on my habits thanks to Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"In this case u can keep all your secrets"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app 💕 it's got it all and I love that it's customizable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Multi device access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using now for 3 years. One of the many great things about this is that it's uploaded to the cloud. I've changed phones twice and i don't have to worry about losing any of my entries. I can add photos to any entry. It's just great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app, but it's not password protected at all. If you want to bypass the passcode just upload a photo from outside the app. Needs a fix."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Checked out quite a few diary/journal apps, and this app has the best features. Firstly the UI is clean, simple and minimalistic. Second, and more important, you can access the app from the mobile or through the webapp - the latter is NOT offered by a ""free"" versions of any other app. What more can you ask for? And btw, if you dont want to use the webapp, you can use the 'Your Phone"" app on Windows 10."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Features which you actually use are available in open source alternatives without having your data held to ransom. Something like Joplin may not have as much lipstick but the core functionality is the same. Beware of trusting years worth of diary entries to a platform which only allows you to download it as a premium feature. Additionally I have had issues with the backup and notes disappearing into the ether."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this app for ages, but during lockdown I've been working on writing up years of journals into one place. This app is perfect for this. I love that I can see what I was doing on this day in past years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Basically a note taking app with some fluffy stuff aimed at teenage girls. You have to pay for dark mode. Thanks, but Google Keep will do basically all the same stuff for me and not have the exclusionary feel good content or the CONSTANT nagging to upgrade. And no, they don't owe it to me to make content for men, but I just wish they were upfront about all their coaching stuff being targeted at (younger) women. And dark mode default would be nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It isn't free, it has a ridiculous subscription fee (as do many other apps, doesn't make it any less ridiculous) if you want to use any of the formatting. Pathetic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for almost 2 yrs now, I guess. Time flies so fast ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Its UI and concept are fine. But the experience is ruined by several things. First of all, it doesn't autosave and it deletes everything you've written if you momentarily switch to another app. Secondly, it WILL NOT stop bugging me to buy premium. Now I am someone who buys premium for a lot of my apps, but there is a pop-up every time I open the app, a banner along the bottom, notifications, and then sometimes it will ask me MULTIPLE times while I am using the app. Super annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a useful Journal app. Love how easy it is to use it across my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps a lot someone who have anxiety and depression, beause I just realized that writting what happens to you the entire day and expressing how you really feel without fear of criticism; would help you ""reflect"" to yourself and very therapeutic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this, its so easy to keep a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for the past two years. I love the fact that I can use my tablet and laptop computer to type in entries. This app has been helpful to journal my weight loss and emotions as well. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had this app 2 years for 14.99. On march 12 the app renewed and charged me 32.99. I immediately contacted google to cancel. They will not refund my difference in suddenly 20 dollars more. I have no app now and still charged me and won't refund my money. The policy says if not happy within 72 hours a refund. Which my contact to cancel was a half hour. I am so mad. People they up price without your knowledge.. dont buy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why do I have to subscribe? I'm out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is exactly what I have been looking for forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has all the functionality that I need (tags, images, pass code). I just have to be more regular in posting my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, Wonderful experience. Download it now. You won't regret it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"*2021 Update* I feel this is still the best journaling app out there. With the recent updates that allow you to export, you have a customer for life! I've been using it since 2018 when a move forced me to take the subway for work. My usual hand written journaling was out of the question. Journey allowed me to keep journaling during those long commutes. It has all the things you need and nothing you don't. Adding media to an enrty is a breeze and makes each entry more rich. This app rocks 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this in my daily basis and having starting journaling through journey was so easy, eventhough I am a first timer. Thank you, Journey :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app but I wonder if it's out for my eyes with the blue backlighting or is it cause I'm a basic user?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Easy to use. Well organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years it's holding up to my expectations"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Once you support inline images let me know!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Where did the spell check go?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Disabled web support in incognito mode, which is how I used the app 90% of the time because I'm on a work computer and I don't want to save my Google log-ins on the browser."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"If you care about your mental health, this app is it. I just wish there are some things for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Friendly and helpful :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mother is everything for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal ap I have ever used. Period."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thankyou for making this app.❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love that it has a passcode to login so my notes are secured and also that I can do them on different devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Waste of my time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it , very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. But you have to purchase a premium version to benefits from all the facilities. It is too bad that they do not allow the desktop version to be operated via the same subscription. You have to buy separate subscription for computer and android mobiles and iphones"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app to journal. I chose to pay for it because it's the only one I found with video logging options. I also like that it is super private and has its own pun number to access and log."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever! Do yourself a favor and install it. You won't need to subscribe to enjoy the best experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad experience with company. Repeatedly told me to email them to ask for a refund after selling me an old, unsuitable macOS app to go with this and then just ignored me and kept my money. Android app itself is OK, think rating is fair to warn users how company behaved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice I can use it on multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app, it's been my secret home for some years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved this app......i highly recommend this app....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I can keep this as my personal diary...the thing is I'm broke and I can't pay for the customization but it's fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app I love the Google sync!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using Journey for years. Sometimes it crashes but with thourough investigations that take time I am able to retrieve my information which is very important to me. I have paid for a subscription and it is worth it. There are some things that I hope would change and I think the developers will get around to it in time. Thanks for storing my memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journaling app 🤘🏻, don't even know why there are critical comments lol. My entries since 2016 are still here. Uninstalled last month because my phone don't have enough internal storage, but found a way to release some space, installed it again, and yeah entries still here. Just a question though, where are those cute gif foxes from before? Lol missed them 😂 Plus, developer maams/sirs it would be lovely if we could move the app to sd card 💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this app, helping me stay accountable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy tool to record diary. The automatic date and time is convenient. Clean UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it, aaaa lot 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I payed for an introductory price of 775.00 for an annual subscription but I still can't use all the features of the app. Please fix this. 😣"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love love this app. I use it will the time. So easy to have it with you whenever you want to journal for a minute."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too much cost to be made"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I lovevthis way of keeping my memories alive. I have been using for 4 years and love the throwback from previous years. I do find it frustrating that I can't access Google photos directly from the app and have to fiddle around with photographs. But that's my only gripe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the journey diary. It's been a great place to put significant parts of my life that I can reflect back on. Thanks for your work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the Journey app! Since downloading the app, I have made considerably fewer tweets that alarm my close friends and family. Journey has given me a digital vault to lock away every thought that would cause my loved ones unnecessary distress. Now every get together can masquerade as a happy occasion and not the psychological torture that lurks just below the surface of every minor occurance that I interpret the wrong way. Hide the pain away and drink to forget with Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I actually am consistent writing in my journal with this. I do it via audio dictation on my Android and it works amazing. Google Pixel 4A. I can talk at essentially Full speed or even faster and it's extremely accurate. I just have to enunciate well and that's that.it's nice always having my journal with me so to speak, because it's on my phone and in the cloud, so I don't worry about losing it and it's easy to stay current writing in it because again I always have it with me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Quite bizarre that you need to pay to use night mode.. personally I don't consider night mode a luxury add on, it's something I look for in every app I use because I have sensitive eyes. Is there no chance of you making this available for everyone? Not sure how often I'll use it considering it's the brightest app on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Even without subscribing, you are still given access to very nice basic features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. With the sign in features, one can pick where they left off. If the basic quotation is there for free, it will be even better. But, it is already a good app. Keep it up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am glad I updated my stuff here I uninstalled the app by mistake n am downloaded it again and evrythn came back the second I added my email address am glad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Like others on here, I was ripped off. They will not refund me. They are the worst company in the play store. Do not trust your money with them. Because they will continue to charge you. Or double charge you as some on this platform have noted. They are positively criminals who actually steal money. I am changing my credit card number because of them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wanted to love this app but it glitches. When I am done writing an entry it randomly either shows a checkmark showing that it saved successfully or an exclamation mark if it doesn't. No saved draft, no warning, just deleted all that writing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Matakaw na app Scam Bwisit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love having a place for pictures and the weather! Very pleased with the whole design."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can have all the options in different apps for free, why would i use this?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Actually a great app to write your story in, full feature u can use to completed your story"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice features, easy to use and works across platforms and has backup capabilities and coaching for building a journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for journalling when your an on the go busy mum"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice application😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. The guide provide a great way to start for anyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Has loads of features and works smoothly. Used to be some links around being reminded to write just after I had done but seems to be better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and update with pictures and reference. Map could be a little more accurate but overall ideal for keeping track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps... It helped"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is charming and let's me write my story, my adventure and my beliefs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Need more stickers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"الطبيق مفيد جدا و استخدامه سهل و بسيط"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it too much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All around good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pay to f..ing almost everything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! Especially because I don't always feel like writing. It's a lot easier to just text it out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really helpful, helps you do develop good habits such as reading, meditating and reflecting on specific things in your life, there's a lot of topics to read and learn from, really enjoying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Rarely use it but don't have to remember how to everytime. Simple, clean, easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Although a good app, i think there should be feature to make a word get Bigger in ""H1"" in a line. Whenever i use H1 for a word, the whole sentence gets bigger. I'll appreciate the devs if there is an option to make a word in a sentence bigger or the whole sentence bigger whenever i chose H1,H2 or H3."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like how easy it is to journal regardless of platform I use - android phone, ipad, computer. The interface is user friendly in all iterations. I understand the need for a subscription price, but it is true that it is a tad on the pricey side for what it is. I'm not sure if I will continue past the first year, but it has been useful in helping me make journaling a habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I find this app easy to use and I don't I will actually use it! Trying to write something every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A place to note one's aphorism. Unlike a to-do diary, Journey, to me, is meant to reflect one's thoughts & reflections to events or experiences of the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why? Do you get money for signing people up? When you cannot even use the app unless you signup, for something you do not need. What should you expect, a 5 rating? Let that be a choice within the app. Let me try it out and see how wonderful it is rather than being met with a sign-in wall. Google is already too intrusive. When I walk out of a store and get a creepy message from google asking me about my experience. It's a bit much. Now if I want to check out an app, I have to sign in?...plz"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I downloaded a lifetime subscription of this app in 2020 and since then they have already started to annually charge me $32 membership fees again. I have sent the proof over to Google Play Store immediately and its developers for a refund to get denied by them both. DO NOT DOWNLOAD ITS A SCAM TO STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARDS NUMBER THEN YOUR MONEY AT THEIR CONVENIENCE! I HAVE ALL THE PROOF OF IT TOO! Don't be a victim to this scam just because it seems too good to be true it probably is. Walk away!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good effort"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wash if I knew this app earlier in 2020 during the pandemic. It would have been some great memories. But I'm still 18 now so I'm gonna journal from now till my death. It'll will be an amazing journey.... (no pun intended)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, supports variety of journaling types and media, easy to export entries in various file formats, sends nice ""throwback entries"" from either 1 month ago or 1 year ago"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good journaling app. Simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journaling app. I love the sync feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish it was easier to print into book form. Not a lot of options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I did not want this app. The day I went to cancel, I was already charged 30$. I dont use the app and was denied a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good for keeping up with results of diabetic tests and monitoring my diet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like this app Hives me a place to write down my emotions But my phone keeps freezing while I type and then closes or just kicks me out Pls fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"stealing money via PayPal. I downloaded and used this app one time. I somehow wasn't paying attention and it Linked my Paypal account and signed me up for a recurring subscription. My first charge showed up several days later. No clear way to cancel the charges on the website no way to contact customer service directly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Really good, simple app where I can dictate my thoughts, records etcetera. The big drawback is that it is ALWAYS trying to get me to buy, with EVERY action. Maybe if it didn't bother me so much..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth the subscription price! This app is user friendly and customizable. It gives me daily prompts to remember to write and to enter my general feeling for the day. It has geotagging as well so when I journal I don't have to say exactly where I was at the time. There is a function to download and print in the purchased app also. Journey fulfills my need to keep a daily gratitude journal for my mental health which has been so important during the pandemic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very user friendly. Ads are a bit annoying (they will pop up anytime you select anything), but tolerable. I would buy premium, but $90 is too much and a subscription is never very appealing. I would probably buy it if the price was lowered to $20 at most. Overall, though, good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In a word, Excellent. Use this app daily for making journal notes. Yes, it costs. But, in my opinion it's worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Delightful to use and it syncs with my iphone. That is what I like most 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Very convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is pretty nice. Allows me to capture the day, dreams, or general notes as the day goes along. I have used it everyday for the past couple of months. I like the security/log in options and the notifications sent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app minus all of the pop ups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Journal with great features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me externalize my inner thoughts; I call it my ""mental workbench"". I use this whenever inspiration or curious thoughts are roused; to examine both myself and others in my life. This app pairs nicely with 'The Pattern'; as well as any meditation apps; or apps that challenge you to examine your life in order to improve yourself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple, and does what I need. Glad to be using this app. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was great at first now it isn't saving any of my entries, which is infuriating. Fix it!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"PAZEER AHME"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journaling app I've ever used. It has many brilliant features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really hard when a spouse dies. You have so much to say.it really helps being able to just click the mic button and record what I'm saying, thinking and feeling. Plus it's super easy to use even when I'm crying so hard I can barely see the keyboard"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The more you put into it the better it gets. Its wonderful to be able to search for things that otherwise would be forgotten. Just to look back at what was in my life and on my mind a year or years ago. I wish I could do more Journaling. I think this is certainly one of my most important apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A lot of features for a note app. A+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Who ""subscribes"" to the services of a private journal? How is it really all that secure and private, if someone else online can read it, for the sake of offering their supposed counseling services? And why the $!#@ do you think putting full-screen ads in my face when I'm trying to read or write would ever convince me to subscribe to your services? Instead, I just deleted the app altogether, cuz I don't tolerate such unnecessary rudeness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal App if your looking for one to write in daily. The interface is very appealing and easy to use. It has a lot of features, like multiple devices sync. Has an atlas for writing in different parts of the world, calender view, and other modes and cool features. A must have app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Updates Feb 2021: 3 years later, still waiting for these features! ------ 2018: A great, intuitive, feature packed journalling app. Has many awesome features, including a mood tag, dark mode, markdown, geotagging, uploading photos, Google fit data etc. Only wish it had the ability to automatically import FB status and Swarm check-ins as journal entries as well - would automatically become a default life logger. Removing 1 star for that. Will update with 5 stars when they integrate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pay wall spam."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super nice journal app. Love the thumbprint security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For the most part the app is good. I still prefer using the sun version I'm most cases as it is a little easier to use. One of the things I really like about the app is the ability to dictate my thoughts rather than trying which gives my fingers s chance to relax after s long day working on computers. Due to the whole pandemic thing I don't get out much, although I think of I was more monitoring able to make entries on the go would increase my user of the app. We'll see how that goes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Las suficientes funciones con una interface genial. Realmente los tags abren un abanico de opciones para organizar las notas, los filtros para visualizar las notas (calendario, tags, etc) son útiles. A resaltar la facilidad para typing en cualquier dispositivo con sincronización inmediata, capacidad de subir archivos y diferentes opciones en las notas como la ubicación, el mood, fecha y hora, etc; que hacen que un buen usuarios se encariñe rápido. HE USADO PREMIUM, doy feedback luego de semanas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for record keeping"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love this app to keep my thoughts in. it is easy to use and it's always with me. It is now February 2021. I still love the fact i have somewhere to put my feelings without having to worry about it being snooped into by the family."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Very easy to use, could use less ads in the free version. It's pretty annoying, but overall happy with it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A functional app. I have the premium version and I'm a little bothered that I still get adds for the subscription version. I'd like a little more functionality in mood tracking, but overall this is a good app and I don't mind having paid for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lost everything! I didn't pay for it. I was just dealing with the ads. Well, I got a new phone. The app transfered over to the new phone, but not any info or journal entries. Lost everything. 7 months of daily entries. It says that it backs it up to cloud. But, it doesn't back it up anywhere. And I've been unable to reach any kind of customer service or the maker to figure out if there's anything I can do. So, I will not buy this app/pay for it. I will be going with a different one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. Only thing that is a little annoying is that they keep giving me advertisements for buying the premium when I already have the premium. Overall excellent though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for years i journal however my hands have got arthritis so it's difficult for me to write this app is awesome I'm able to speak it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. No glitches. Secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Customer service is non-existent if you need to deal with billing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"A good journal app but the upgrade to premium ads are obnoxious and frequent, and premium itself is *insanely* overpriced. I *might* be persuaded to pay €10 for lifetime access, but €100 is beyond ridiculous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app with multi useful functions, easy to use interface. i was using it for a short time in the past and forgot it for awhile. now im coming back and there are entries that i dont even remember exist! i think I'll be consistent in write down my diary from now on since i have a crooked memory"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am on a 2 yr journey great for reviewing where I was on any given day Have been using for couple of yrs easy to use, happy with app. Update have used this app for nearly 3 years no problems, really do like"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Oh...Come On !!! As you would normally do when you've installed a new app, you begin with the basics like Set-Up...After my first 5 selections within ""Settings"" I immediately decided there's got to be better apps out there than this... Did I tell you why I uninstalled this? Because out of the first 5 selections within Settings, 4 of them required me to pay and upgrade prior to set-up... I get it..To stay competitive you need to be able to FREE before you nickle and dime the fools."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Subscription canceled. I was inadvertently double charged and this developer actively ignored my requests to refund the second charge. They intentionally chose to refuse to communicate. Use caution, these people have no qualms about ripping off customers. Submitted a credit card fraud report, they agreed, issued a full refund. Meanwhile the app is uninstalled, back to Day One where there is ethics, good communication and an excellent user interface. Shame on Journey for chasing away a customer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great with many interesting & helpful options. But please fix the issue of adding a location to the journal, the map doesn't open."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"the blue ui is ugly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Tried 4 other diary apps first. This one is the bomb."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Aggressive ads and popups for their subscription service. I'd pay a small fee to buy a version to turn off the ads, but am not interested in their subscription. Additionally, basic formatting features, such as headers, lists, etc appear to be behind the pay subscription, effectively crippling an otherwise decent app. Strongly do not recommend this app at all. Confirmed after contacting support, subscription is required features such as basic formatting. Worst developer on the Play Store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for Journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, but the pop-ups asking to upgrade are way too many, super annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app..I just have to remember to use it more often"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years as a personal journal. One of the best purchases I made on the playstore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I record everything here. Events, good stuff, bad stuff, photos n videos. Always great to look back on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great and very helpful especially on taking notes of important details in daily living."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent journal app. Customizable templates would be nice. And importing doesn't always work so great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy being able to write down and save my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"To many ads even on paid service. I want zero ads and zero usage stats"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've tried lots of diary apps and this one worked the best for me. I did get it when you could make a one off payment though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A lot of ads but suffient for my needs. Just for a private life editor in its simplistic form is quite adequate for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's okay for what I need. If the options for the color and letter sizes were easier I would love it. Other than that I use it regularly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been a grea journey with JOURNEY 😉. It's simple easy to use app. No adds nothing to distract u from ur work. I love using it. And I will recommend it to u too 😊. It's also keeps ur privacy safe with app lock so that only u can access the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall the app is great & for all it's faults, has helped with one important thing ~ getting me to actually journal.. & frequently too. So thank you. Some criticisms: (1) Keyboard editor bugs - c'mon guys. why not use an open source WSIWYG editor instead of writing your own. (2) Buggy auth on the web version Potential improvements: (1) Allow color coding of entries similar to Google Keep. Easier to find entries you consider 'important' etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Free is good ... i think the paid version is too expensive to justify the cost ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wanted to start journaling again and so far this has kept me coming back daily (for the past week)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it daily. Makes journaling much easier"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love my journal just the way it is,I don't have to have the premium.I just need somewhere to express my thoughts, feelings and anything else...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gr8 app. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"İts so suspicious and reeaaaalllly slow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Impossible to stop auto-renewal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Even trail days it's allowed to use u have to pay.. bye"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful app. Worth trying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is really good. I have it on my phone and computer. I had to pay for ur on my computer and it prompts me daily to try to get me to subscribe and pay for it on my phone which I find to be a bit annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been for 2 months now.. Really great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice aap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app... very private and confidential... like a good friend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years. And I love that I can go back into my old journals and digitize those as well, because you can change the date and time and location of your entry. Love that you can add pictures and even your mood of the day. It's good to go back and read your thoughts and see how you have grown and changed. It's also really good to see what it felt like when you were younger. You really do forget exactly how you felt."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best journaling application out there. 3 years and counting. Thank You so much for your efforts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not Able To Sync With My Google Account..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, great way to clear your mind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Save fails and I lose all my changes. Makes no sense. Useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. An awesome Journaling tool incorporate with a calendar and other add on. Pretty neat!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't make me sign up before letting me know that it's a paid app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update 6 years later: I STILL love this app! I love this app. It has a beautiful material design interface, syncs to its servers so you can journal from any device, and includes journal prompts if you want them. Plus a whole lot more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Started using it based on reviews but abandoned it very quickly. The web interface is poor with a tiny window for actually writing. I installed the app on my phone, but found that unusable due to constant prompts to subscribe. I might well have paid had I liked the the app but I'd have liked the chance to try it properly first"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For someone who love to write diary, This is the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love this App. Works Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved this app and thought customer service was prompt until I was billed twice for the premium version and I asked for a refund of the second billing. I was told to provide the receipt of the transaction which I did.. After that I was told the billing team will see to the issue. That was Dec 18. Since then nobody has responded to email any customer service communication."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Because many I'd not for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I understand the need for a sustainable business model but subscription plans instantly trigger a healthy rejection feeling in me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Does what it says on the tin..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exploring the app presently"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is calming and the best app I have ever used check out there instagram and go follow then follow me at iittss.precious for a follow back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! The features are better than the other Journaling apps I've used in the past and I have recommended it to all my friends and family."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very very good app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app, as most importantly it is intuitive and easy to use, to support my Journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, being looking for something like this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is really cool. However, it keeps pushing you to get the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"cannot erase my post. I have no control of my account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"GREAT JOURNALING APP"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very limited no web sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps to keep a private journal with so amazing layouts and specific features like photo pinning, location, weather and emotional which helps to keep tracker of moods and place's we've seen. A very good journey deserve a good documentation."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the way this app works and for the design. I've been looking for one for a long time and it has a lot of features even without a membership. I will eventually get a membership because it's very reasonable and you get even more features. Thank you for making this app! It's wonderful! They thought of a lot of things if not more than I was trying to find!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you have to buy every feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. A place to pen my thoughts at the end of the day. It's indeed a journey for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for what I need - literally just a daily entry for a few weeks at a time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great substitute for making diary entries. Although would've loved if there were an option to enter a password while logging in with an existing google account from another device. Its pretty scary to think that anybody could log in to my account without me knowing. Love the app ♥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 stars if the app had less promo popups. Had to block the notifications."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app before, it has a clean, visually pleasing and easy to navigate interface. Probably the best I've seen. It serves its purpose and offers plenty of features with the free version. I'm glad this app is still available, it was here in a time of need for me. Thank you to the developers <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this about a year now and love it! Great layout, easy to write, attach pictures and look back on part entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for a daily journal. Been using it for several years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best! 🌹🖤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good apps. amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overwhelmingly useful. I recommend to every user of note app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek, very pretty app. Works great. I love that you can add pictures and a passcode so no one can get into your journal. As soon as I have money, I will be purchasing the subscription for the unforeseeable future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still using enjoying the app..been a user since 2017..I just enjoy the google synch functionality..never losing your life's great events🙏🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best of the journal apps. Worth the subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"UPDATE: 1/30/21: I really like this app and the Blog. I paid for the membership but I think it work great with a few adjustments: • Make Coach available across all platforms. • Allow more than 1 Coach program at a time. • Templates should be used on the app and the desktop version. I have only been able to use them on the desktop. I find myself, using 3 different systems. I use Coach on the app, then I have to use the desktop version to get the template for the Morning and Evening Power question"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's okay but take out the Ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Do for not bad. Only bad thing is the constant requesting to do the pay option. It's annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app it offers a great way to keep my goals written down and also to make a daily diary about events that I find important."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Lovely, but would like to be able to record multiple voice notes in a day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth the subscription. I bought the app several years ago and have changed phones several times and I use the same email and the app is not updating my subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, just really needs to get rid of the constant barrage of subscription offers so that I can use it in peace. It really takes you out of things, it's an easy fix to remove the pop-up ads too so it really should not take long if a fix were in development. Would give 5 stars if they fixed this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is soon to be a safe place for me to even Chronicle my covid-19 thoughts. I am so in love with this safe place for my heart songs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it a long time. Convenient. Private. I like putting a note in wherever I am and seeing it later on the atlas. Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍 👌 👍 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for over 3 years now, and it's a really handy little app to jot down journal entries. I do love to write physically with pen and paper, but the fact is that I'm much more likely to have my phone handy so I do all my journalling on here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice way of developing and sticking to personal goals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey will deduct a YEARS subscription without warning and then push you over to different email departments to avoid refunding you. What does that say about your integrity as an app who is meant to add positivity to peoples lives? No one has answered my email or attended to the matter for over a month"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How do I unsubscribe?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app UI and easy to catalog days to remember. I used to use Evernote for this but Journey is very tailored to being a diary so I like it better for this purpose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great features. Easy to use. Journal your life without relying on social media. I love how I can insert pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use it for my trips, and is habit forming. So far so good 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice application to save your memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Purchased an annual subscription but it wouldn't work with my old GSuite account. Then when I wanted to move the subscription to a different non-GSuite account, customer service was of no help. Sent screenshots and they acted like they didn't know how their app could not work. I ended up never using the annual subscription because it was not compatible with the old GSuite account and I could not get a refund or the subscription moved to a different Google account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great diary but wish location feature was better, since is the main reason why I chose this app over other similar ones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app To write thing about your life and there things $"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Not only remind me to write, but makes me thinks so much about my life. Makes me have a habit to write at leas one sentence a day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for 4 years now. Its good to write down what I feel on the go..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app,I don't know how I ever cut wood without it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I think it's unnecessary to charge to use bold. Sometimes you have to give to get."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use the free app easy to add pics or attachments. Option to upgrade if you want to .I just need a basic journal app and this works for me 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very convenient for quickly writing down ideas that I have"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is pretty good. I love that you can sync the mobile app with the Microsoft store app and the cloud. A couple of improvements would be to save multiple days as one pdf file and be able to share your app with someone else (i.e. psychotherapist)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good dedicated app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really great! You can go back to your old journals you wrote and it brings back alot of memories from your past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"100 would recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still use it since 2017. I hope to be able to take a note with pen and have more options where to save or sync the notes. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app itself is decent, it looks good and does what I wanted. The constant ads are awful. Every time I open the app and then log an entry I get two lots of ads for the paid version. If the paid version we're a reasonable price I would probably pay it just to make them go away but £85 for lifetime upgrade?! It's a flipping journal. Will be swapping back to the journal I used previously which didn't constantly harass me to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is great. A bit of a learning curve needed. The challenge is making it a habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been helpful to keep up with my days and weather associated. I have to keep a log so keeping it here has been beneficial to my busy work schedule."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Started diary habit with this apps and able to consistently input. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using the free version for months now. I LOVE IT! This has replaced my paper journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you. One of the best apps ever. God bless! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple app. I can write peacefully."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Simple to use, is password protected and all around a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing journal. As there are some features that require paid subscription that is something i don't like as i have no money and I'm a freeloader i hate to pay for something. I don't care you earn anything or not but you must give only me all your services for free that is a bug you need to fix . As i love your app you must be honoured that i am using your app and the time i put in to give this review you should give me your premium subscription for free to me immediately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Track my daily routine and help me organize my goal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a fine app, but it asks me to buy the premium version at least twice per time I actually use the app. It's ridiculous, and I can't get it to stop asking. I understand the app needs to make money, but let me just use the (limited) free features in peace without harassing me with a barage of ""fire sales"" and ads to buy the full version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app been using it as a diary for 5 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"More amazing and fantastic!!!!💓"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it seems to work great no legs no legs connects to everything and I get to leave a log to my children"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall its good. But should provide sharing option for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"BS App. Hidden cost:Trial Only then have to pay a monthly fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app The premium allows me see my progress year after year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Minimal. Waste of time. Unnecessary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used journey for over two years, it's pretty great for being able to jot down daily thoughts and experiences, I'm always glad I downloaded this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost all my back up from last year. Great 🖕🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for a lifetime membership on my old iPhone. I just bought an Android and was told my membership will not transfer. If I had known this I would not have purchased a membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Had it for over a year. Put all my thoughts in it very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How hard it is to make a bloody app for taking notes without making it the most obnoxious money sucking machine. NO I do not want to pay 4.99 a month for a bloody diary so STOP ASKING ME TO. This app is a bad joke"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This could be five stars (and it once was): give the ability to rotate screen on mobile device, in case user wants to use a Bluetooth keyboard. If upgraded to Premium already, stop trying to sell further upgrades to those members. They helped you build your platform in the first place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good, seems like a great full feature journal app. But, using free version I am constantly having to wave off prompts to subscribe and rate. Too much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Private. I like being able to attach pics or screen shots to the post. Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me keep a stream of consciousness journal to cope with the loss of a marriage, a father, and five immediate family members in the last 14 months. I don't know where I'd be without Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought this app years ago. It was a lifetime payment. Now it sent me a welcome message, and it wants me to pay again. Thieves."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good journal app backed by Google drive, so it has the same security properties as a Google doc. I recommend this to people when I hear they are doing stuff like making private Facebook posts as a journal, which is way less likely to stay private over the years. Thank you Journey, this does the thing I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"EDIT: I can no longer recommend this app. I have premium, and Journey STILL sends push notifications that cannot be disabled for other paid material, as well as advertising within the app. This is unacceptable when a user has already paid. //// I love this app enough that I paid for the full version, but the daily reminders stopped a couple weeks ago. Edit: A recent update fixed this. Perfect!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but wayyyyy too many ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Kinda chill experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm trying to get back to the habit of journaling, and journey gently but consistently reminds me without making me feel badly for not being as good as I'd like to be! It's affordable, connects with the few other apps I'd also like to get better at using, and is super streamlined."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You can see what information Facebook gets from other apps/websites in the latest Facebook version. Looks like Journey is selling users' data to Facebook. Wondering what kind of data a journaling app can monetize... At any rate, you can disable the data sharing in Facebook, but they're probably selling our data elsewhere as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good application for writing diary. Paid and unpaid platform both are good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Wish I could attach GIFs better yet wish I could attach GIFS in the texts section. That would be perfect :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love the part that allow me to make past entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nothing negative to say about this app. I love it a lot. It helps me to be mindful of my journey by reminding me with writing prompts each day. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good and comfortable app, but 2 things... 1. Constant forcing to pay. Maybe there are better ways and monetization models. Like limit symbols per day or calendar capacity. 2. Do you really need to mark the exact time of the event? Everytime?:)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"useless"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Useful but slightly annoying. The popups for pro upgrade and discount, which always come up when I try to use the app are disruptive, and push me more towards switching to another app rather than upgrading. Unfortunate since this app is decent for free version, allowing images and neat design (backup is pro version unfortunately). However, if I found a similar app without popups, I'd switch."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy putting thoughts down for reflection"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Stuff paying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app really makes journalling easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I try it first thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Is not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Versatile and useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Have been using it for years.i find it useful to make my everyday journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Its ok .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best ever journal experience with really nice coaches. Very supportive and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Needed to get myself a journal for my mental health. This does the job, I've been using it everyday! Unlike most others it doesn't pop up with ads all the time. The only downside is it keeps locking me out of the app then I have to go back into it again. Luckily it does save what I have written when I log back in! Other than that I am pleased with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's very nice I'm grateful for this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App! I've been using this app for so many years but I haven't encountered any issues and it's easy to use. Developers also listened to what you like to include in their app. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life changing app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly and versatile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"🖤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey shares my data with Facebook!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app exactly what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Honestly i love the app, but i hate that it keeps reformatting my entries all the time between the desktop app and the phone one. I really liked the simple version that they had in the past with the google chrome add on, and no options for formatting text/having indentations. (it was something more like keep or notepad). Because it was alot more simple and intuitive. Im trying to find a way to get back to an earlier version without the additional formatting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pop up after pop up after pop up asking you to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't change photo or email,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, I've been using it for almost 4 years now. Very organized and easy to search for my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love all the options you have with this app. It makes it easier to emphasize information with color and photos!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this application esay and best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please I don't want your app, I contacted you and emailed you about the notification you keep sending me via google and sms. Fix it. It is annoying. I couldn't even discover the app I uninstalled it yesterday. Please fix and see your message and emails."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app because I get to write about stuff that happens to me daily in life. Plus, I used to write in a real journal back many years ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can write anything and I love having a Journal!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Want safe my 9love and followers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to flush down thoughts in one go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Couldn't be happier! I use this to track my miracle morning goals and help create a vision"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I didn't realize you had to pay for it. Deleting already."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good, so I have subscribed. Just few suggestions: ❶ For journal entries with multiple photo, it would be nice if we can add description to each photo, and all photo can be displayed by scrolling in the journal entry, something like facebook. ❷ Allow user to adjust the journal entry date and remove the time in some occassions. ❸ You might want to consider providing album printing serivice?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simply amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. By typing Journal Entries about my everyday life it allows my to look back and make some self improvements."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoyable and useful app, worth paying for the premium version. I've been able to move away from paper journaling easily and the tags, ability to add pictures and analytics are interesting. Two improvements I'd like to see: - more moods to pick from - habit tracking Still recommended without these features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Update. I upgraded to the paid version. And everything I type gets lost. It's so discouraging and disappointing. I hate this app. Don't enter anything important in this. You'll probably lose it. This was one of my favorite apps. I didn't mind the daily requests to upgrade because it was such a good journaling app. But something has happened recently. The last 3 times I've used it, I have lost giant portions of what I've written. It's so discouraging."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, been using it for a couple years now. Would rate it 5 stars, but since they specifically ask you to ""Rate us 5 stars"", I won't. When you change that text to a simple ""Rate us"", I'll change my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oh yeah. I love this app. I mean I've never had one like it to compare to but I mean how complex can this be? I can add photos I can do all kinds of stuff I don't even know what. Lol I was heart broken when I thought it was lost but it was pretty easy to redownload and sign in and get all of my stuff back so I APPRECIATE THAT ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy with the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have this app on multiple devices and I love being able to jot down entries on which ever device I happen to have on hand. I have had no problems with it so far and I have had it for months. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Intrusive ad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Windows premium companion app does not login anymore, and support is ""away"". $20 for an app which is rubbish - I am kicking myself for being such a naive fool and trusting them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm glad they have a premium Android option because I don't like subscriptions. The journaling looks nice especially on night mode because I like dark backgrounds otherwise my eyes have a lot of trouble with bright screens. Thank you for making this app look as nice as it does!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dick diver or mcgovern I'll guide hurtz"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"(Random) The only way that this app would be any better is if they would collab with youper. ❤💛💚💙💜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I only have the free version but it's a very good journal and it's very functional, it makes me feel better to get things off my chest and I don't really have another outlet so I like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I never thought I'd like journaling until this app came. I started it back in 2017 and for the last 3 years this app has helped guide me through life. The simple act of writing down my thoughts helps me see myself. It's great in combination with cbt, cpt, and mindfulness. This app and the developers are great. You will not be disappointed with the lifetime purchase!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app so far, but I have a complaint in the desktop app. After I installed, the app naturally asks me to sign into my google account. But an google error message comes up saying that ""This browser or app may not be secure. Try using a different browser. If you're already using a supported browser, and you refresh your screen and try again to sign in."" Please fix the desktop app. Im using this app because it has cross platform support as well as google drive backup."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"How do I unsubscribe? I could not find instructions to do so. I was unable to learn about the app without subscribing. However, once I could not find.the instructions to unsubsvribe, zi lost interest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journaling app is amazing has everything I wanted to! Just changed my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, with great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free, already hassling for money before I can even add an entry. Better off with a private Facebook group by myself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool to focus my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is way better than the last one I tried. It has many cool features like being able to save it to our Gmail and being able to use Biometrics to log in. The only problem I have with it is that everytime I log in, their is always an ad for me to buy something. It gets annoying at times. Other than that I have had a great experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this multiple times a day..best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have only just started using, so far it seems amazing! Will update once I've had more experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, useful notifications, widget is also nice. Configuration options are just what I need - nothing is lacking, but still everything is clear."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good when I use it 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Genuinely best journal App! Wish they could have more life long reasonable package!! Lowering the Price package more reasonable would make this app the best in Google app store!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that it is an electronic journal and I can keep it private by adding a passcode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I so needed this space. I already love you. You big dick. I'm learning to love me. ♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apk."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use. Both app and desktop version. Highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, great add ons"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Esse aplicativo é maravilhoso, já tem 11 dias que estou escrevendo nele..... recomendo muito!!!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have only just started using Journey, and find this wonderfull."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't know why, but wherever I feel sad or mad, I write it on this app and it always makes me feel 10 times better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for about 2 years. Definitely enjoy the interface, privacy and all the improvements that has happened from the past. I think to further improve the experience, adding more photos and multiple video attachments would make me give a 5 star rating ⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use, just wish it had more free options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. The customer service is outstanding responding to me always very quickly. I can export my data for safety. Each entry is searchable. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've found the app is very helpful as a personal journal tool. It helps me organize my thoughts & stays focus on my purpose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and it was updated and years of my posts are lost. Not impressed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. I use it to save Bible verses and thoughts. can sure them to this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its an awesome place to write your feelings and more i love it alot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No dark mode"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good, it's a good experience. I bought a subscription for the year right away. Recommendations for 5 stars: * Voice entries (in future, easy for transcription) * See good examples of entries * Let people set goals for writing frequency * Provide a coach for creativity, not just self-help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Still discovering what it can help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good design. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is surprisingly good app! I love the fact that you can post pictures and write notes under them, which is the main reason why I'm using this. Also moods, temperatures, date, time, and the Golden Gate Bridge as wallpaper! Great customer service! A surprise hit for the beginning of the year!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I thought it was 7 days trial. But 19.9$ deducted on 1st day. Very bad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BUY! I purchased it using the wrong credit card and requested for a refund. It has been12 days and they have started to ignore my emails. Their billing team tried to extort me, said they will only process my refund if I bought their membership, which was more expensive! I purchased the lifetime (8.99) subscription and it turns out it does nothing. You still need to buy the monthly membership (15.99) separately! I've had the worst customer experience with them! Don't download/don't buy!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"clean crisp UI design. The only thing I'm looking for as of right now is an option to export the work I've done into regular docs so that I can read or save the material outside of the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Does this app have a video option? Or even talk to text availability?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Nice and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"When I upload this app to a new device. It is not secure. And any previous pin code lock does not transfer over with the rest of app. Scary if my boyfriend figured that one out!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this over 5 years really amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying it so far, free version is fine, 2 photos or 1 video😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be better if at least dark mode was available in free mode"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A nice clean app to record beautiful memories with pics, videos and location tags. Only issue is the prompt to upgrade and asking permission to access my G drive every single time is annoying!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. I find myself jotting down notes everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When you feel like telling everything to someone, go to journey and write ur all feelings and upload pictures. Its a memory forever to cherish and be grateful for it always, also private and no evil eyes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journaling app. Would recommend even just for 3 days as an experiment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am pay for premium, still I got adv for purchasing of items. What is the meaning of premium I don't understand. Only premium word replace with free. Nothing has to be change. Please take a neesory actions to resolve the same issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I really liked this app for journalling, however I paid their ""one time premium lifetime membership"" for all platforms in 2018 which did not hold true. The app restricts features inspite of paying for the service. I liked the app so much I made subsequent payments to be able to continue however, their app doesn't give you the features you pay for. Contacted their help desk & their online assistant instead of helping tried to get me to make even more payments! Very Duplicitous !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey!! It has helped me capture some of my best moments! If I could go premium right now I would but it's not in my budget! 😄 It is a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm not sure ordered accidentally."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works greats, lots of useful features like tags, time stamps, attachments. Very useful for tracking important incidents and related notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for documenting behaviors. Has a 4 digit pass code."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app but i can't change the text size nor font. Android 7.1.2. I have premium! Please advise"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this and I am going to be using this everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the desktop companion along with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"While there are many ways to journal; Journey makes it convenient to do so."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing a day to day journal, keeping up to date with all the news, appointments, tasks etc that you undertake daily. As a first time journal/diarist keeper. I have found that this app is easy to use and comes in very handy when it comes time to recall some activity, note or appointment. With the use of tags this can shortlist your search results. Definitely a good app to have on your mobile. The more I use it the more I like it and depend on it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's kinda sad that we have limited access to many thing that we can do it's just a waste"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Blank pages. My data seems to have loaded but when i open it's just blank!!! Fix this. 😟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great app indeed. I use this to put all my thoughts (intrusive or constructive) into one app. It's good since it has location and mood, also tags! I wish the interface could be easier to use. For example, editing the journal just by simply clicking the entry rather than clicking a specific button."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey. Has been great for me. Everything from goals and daily to-do list and appointments to reminders and, first and foremost, my Journal. So easy to use and simple to stay organized. I've been using the premium since 2017 and will continue to do so!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Havent really used all that it offers.. but I am already satisfied using it... i could attach photis. I could open it anytime. It can be synced to my Google account so i wont worry about trabsferring it to a new gadget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Best journal app out there. Only reason I have not purchased Premium is the fact that the info snippets on Premium is a slideshow showing each benefit for only 3 seconds before switched.. and there's like 10 of them. Not gonna wait 30 seconds to ""continue reading where I left off"" - 10 times!! Can't even scroll between the tips (should just be this, statically, and let me read at my own pace). If you feel the idiotic _need_ to have it as an automatic slide-show.. email me for tips."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I'm loving Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"really enjoy this journal, I got charged twice for my subscription though. I've canceled one and kept the other, but being charged twice for the same thing kind of hit hard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good. But please give option of entry by speak."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Finally discovered how to change an entry date a little while ago, too! * Updated my review because the app was updated about a week ago. I'm finding it so much harder to use, and it keeps erasing what I have written if I go to another app too fast. so frustrating!!! I have auto update enabled. Really not a fan of the latest upgrade. *Updated again* The erasing issue is resolved, thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mind balancing gathering all of the thoughts and emotions of pure self forfilment inlined with God's hands on the sabbath being a believer of the only thru lord in heaven 🙏.. this application is my most important thing 🙏 ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Lovely to view. My new favorite journal app! Perfect start to the new year!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No refund as promised over email 5 working days have been past. Neither any response. Please respond."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Any possibility to have event series of time line view?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using this journal app. Works great for quickly writing down your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Asks me to buy premium EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app. Really? Leave me alone, I don't want to buy the premium version, the free is totally enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing, stores all memories & moments 🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Loved the overall usability. Very user friendly. I have the premium so that I can add multiple images. I would to be able to ""colour in"" the dates in the calendar though, just to keep track of specific things. Ie night shifts, mood, menstrual cycle... Hope developers can figure something out so I can fully transition from using a physical calendar!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal app I've used so far. Would highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app.it seems.Thank you guys"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Past few months was inundated with ads. Now, 90% of the time it won't even save an entry due to some stupid error. I've lost so many entries due to this. The security also feels lacking. It's all a shame cause originally this was a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well enough. I'm happy with the basic features the free portion of the app provides. I just wish I could snooze or disable the in app pop ups suggesting their paid subscription service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great app! I used the free version for a while and it worked really well. I like the ease of adding photos and videos!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been using for almost 3years with pro program. I kinda disappointed with coach program things because not all of us needs that. I'm getting annoyed with that feature and there's no way to avoid it whenever I'm using this app. Whenever I mention this in review, dev only said ""thanks for supporting us"". Its like I'm talking to the bots. I had to ditch this app and migrate to My Diary app. That app is just exactly what I need - a journal, lots of theme and stickers. I used to love this app so much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not sure if this app can export phot os in monthly to FB or IG"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Nice app, but expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Self-Reflection!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. I use it to log my dreams, mostly. (Weird stuff...)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! The ability to collect my thoughts on multiple devices as well as edit is awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Its a money grabber! $3 monthly for upgrade or $80 lifetime pass is ridiculous. The coach assost is all pre programmed (i.e. you can't customize a squat challenge or your own goals) and seems to be targets towards weak minded people with simplistic feel good tasks. It can sync to Google fit but you gotta upgrade. Can't even change color theme, and there are no entry titles, just an entry date."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for premium and then you changed the membership method.. I will have to pay for again.. This is not how a good company behaves..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can someone tell me that if this app works without paying or we need to pay after trial period?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using the app, nice to keep things up to date and using as motivation for 2021"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I strongly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pls allow choosing of main thumbnail pic (among the 10)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Paid Premium for the app & so glad I did but need to make a routine of using it more often 😅 I do believe it's help me reflect on my life a bit more & is helping me shape the person I'd like to become."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Lol. I'm not paying you for something to write in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App, used it for a big trip to Alaska now I'm Journaling every day life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for a few weeks to jot my musings, reflections, emotional outpourings, intention settings... it's been more convenient than the hard copy notepad i was using before because i always have my phone around. Also love how it needs a passcode to access because i know it is totally private. Enjoying so far for sure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I thought this app is very positive and useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There is no edit for tag and deleting tags ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful journal. I love adding pictures to build memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, wish it had the ability to record audio and post more than four pictures for the free version but very happy with what I got"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is absolutely wonderful to use as a daily diary. Very simple to use and user friendly which is a major strength."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely my go to journal app. I love the features and the minimalist design; its easy to navigate within the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Ordered by mistake and requested refund immediately after purchase. CEO Jeromy replied within minutes and asked me to revise my public review first so they can process my request. I did so. I also filled out several forms and sent several emails but it has been almost a month and no word from this company. Cassandra and Jeromy stopped communicating. I would say this is not an honest company."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use it all the time for my memoirs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Highly Recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience is good. Wish there more ways for me to assist. Your doing great, thank you..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so easy to use. I like the look of it. I like the variety of application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Verry gd"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried many journal apps. This is the most consistent and a much simpler app for everyday use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been an amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's not bad, ***Don't waste your time*** At last , installing many apps for a diary, I got this. It gives an option for auto-backup for free!! Also can sort by date."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the prompts if you sign up for coaching. I haven't been able to get journalling to stick until now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been thinking about using Journey for a really long time but I thought this year I'll try it and see how I go. With experience of writing a blog and I have had a hard copy journal for many years, I was reluctant at first, but what I appreciate is the ease of use. I find there are small moments through the course of the day that before I would not be able to capture and now those moments are on record."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app but the font printed fofmat is so small...!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If I could just afford it, I'd get the lifetime membership. It is a lifetime companion. A beautiful app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"WAS 1 of the best diary apps on the market. but then greed happened. and although they still don't show other ads, you are NOT allowed to make a journal entry till you see their ad demanding money for their services. i repeat: this WAS an excellent app, till about an year ago. now this is just ransomware in disguise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything you need to hold on to a memory is available in this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I have one suggestion: add ability to file entries into folders to keep them separate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. Helps me jot down everything needed to. But I really wish, I could use some of its features for free. You see, not everyone can afford this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"read privacy policy before you blindly write your thoughts and personal information on this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The developer has done a great job. It's cute and easy to use. I took 2 stars off for the 'urgent' pestering you get for full membership. It was what I was wanting and I just wanted to try it out and get a feel within in the free version limited capacity but that pestering has turned me off. Pros. You can add multiple entries per day. Mood indicators. Use cards as prompts. Attach files and pin your location. Cons. To use this fully you need the premium which is a month/year/lifetime sub."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works. Its useful. Why not 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been so helpful while I've been experiencing panic attacks. It helps to write down your thoughts, no matter how irrational. It's always a weight lifted off your shoulders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Giving only three stars because I cannot use the Naira sign inside the app. Secondly I tried to reach customer support and haven't got a reply in two months"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Call"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app its made me grow in many ways I never thought."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job excellently with no additional chaos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a money grab. The autosave function doesn't work, and you can't export your entries without paying. Get another app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am truly enjoying the features and function of this journal. I have tried other online journals, but they were clunky and not interesting to use. This one has so many options for entering different media, and really letting you get to your heart. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, but $30.... I have few important things in here I hope they don't get deleted. I swear I'm missing a few things. But I digress, it's a good app I really enjoy it, but $30.....? C'mon!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Flooded by popups. It looks that the aim of authors is to annoy you by popups every time you open the app until you pay. If you just want a simple daily log without fancy functions like cloud upload, maybe it's not the best choice (it would be without so much noise at every open)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good experience I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much and I love being able to write and take pics 🖼️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The ads about premium... it's frustrating, or else it will be perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a lifetime subscriber and I love this. The only thing I need is for the app to allow me to search for inspirational pictures from google images or similar sources as I have limited photos on my phone. Many of my posts don't have photos attached and I think having one really make a difference while reading them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good so far using the free option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app for writing diary and notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm happy I found this application. I can now able to write my journal in a digital way. Auto back up feature is a good thing to restore my account to other phones. I can now able to express my feelings without the worries of getting read by someone. Kudos to the team!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app, but constantly pesters you to be a paying customer. Will probably find one that isn't quite so annoying to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, I always use this whenever writing my journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Time waste application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's simple fast and elegant. I believe everybody should start journaling with this app. Journaling is a great way to calm the mind can collect all your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lol charging $50 a year for a journal app..is this a joke? Edit: changed from a 1 to a 3 when I realised you can use base functions for free.. but the installation process misleads you into thinking you can only get 7 days free then you pay. And $50 is REDICULOUS. Have also just learned that it spams you with the membership ad EVERY TIME you open the app. Seriously how greedy and annoying can you get. Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, but comes with very simple functionalities compared to other journals when it comes to mental health and personal growth. Works more as a memory cache, still does the job though. Comes with a good variety of pricing options as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is nice. Still feel like some features are needed as a business owner I started my journal so I need a separate section for gratitude, goals and achievements Overall it's good to use in mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this this app everyday. Please add justify-text layout option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is one of my favorites for journaling. I love that I am able to customize it, unlock it with my fingerprint, and easily change the settings. I bought the premium version and have really enjoyed the features. It is great for privacy, as it locks when the screen is turned off and when I finish an entry. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very good app and I enjoy it but I wish I can swipe between photos I add without having to click on it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"We sould pay for it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have just started journaling, again. I really do love this app, there are a lot of integrations with other apps available. It makes it very easy for me to wake up early, say a few words, catch some thoughts, and go on about my day, having put some ideas down on paper or digitally."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nice app but avoid (do not install) because of constantly changing and dodgy charging policies. Google should prevent this type of behaviour."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps. Have been using it for three years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect if you just have a lot of things to say to yourself it's a perfect journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I journal so much more with this app! I absolutely love it! There are also optional lessons you can do. They are informative and fun!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Recurring billing is a no-go, sorry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They bantantly stole my money and do not communicate via emails. No way to contact them directly. Bad reviews are removed. I definitely did NOT buy an annual subscription. You assured me in an email as well as the chat, that I bought the Premium licence. I opened a fraud case at my bank and they cancelled my credit card. This was NOT a misunderstanding on my part but MISLEADING and fraudulent activities on YOUR part."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, just what I needed to keep my private thoughts in order."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Op bhai sb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"One problem that is really necessary to fix is that I sometimes lose my text when using the phone app, lately the phone slipped from my hand and I probably pressed the back button, the text was gone. No auto save function during editing and this is badly needed. I hope you can change this quickly guys because otherwise I love the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app off and on for a while it's really great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being able to add pictures to my entries. I'm also really enjoying the journal coaching prompts. Another great thing is that the premium content allows you to put the app on multiple devices, so that if I want to type up my entry on my tablet, I can. But if I want use my stylus, & write an entry on my phone, I am able to do that as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good app just frequency of adds is too much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app to journal and keep ur mind fresh ha inbuilt aap lock so you can be free to journal and spilout what you want and get it out of your system"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Photo journaling is great for those on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was struggling with the membership plans so I seeked help from the support team. I received immediate and problem solving response. Overall, I am new to the app. I'll keep in my mind to post my thoughts as I use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly. Only problem i have is that when i searched for voice to text diary this app game up. Unfortunately not what I expected, but I decided to keep the app and just type out all my thought which is a pain but the app works well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using the app since 2018 at first it was kinda not a routine but I made sure during 2019 to use it. It is a way for me to destress or express my feeling. hopefully Journey could provide and improve more. suggestions: 1. GeoTagging (location) let user pick there specific location by allowing us to Pin location. (cuase i had a hard time looking through it) 2. Desktop App - for me It really needs a improvement the mobile app is good but the desktop needs enhancement. 3. Photo lay out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Lots of adds but other than that, it's a great journal! I like how you can add moods, locations and media"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome to have my journal stored and saved somewhere safe and accessible wherever I might be (where there's internet). Love it. Had it for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oddly theraputic! I've enjoyed how the app has helped me work through my stuff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only thing I wanna say is thank you for excelling my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Add sponsered both Diaries apps are trial versions. I want free. Bye."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works the way it is supposed to and does more without making itself complex to use. Keeping it simple is the most difficult task to attain now a days. Go for it without thinking twice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I want to transfer my subscription to my new phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I installed this app having used Day one and seeing a comparison online. I'm finding it easy to use and liking the layout."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to gather your thoughts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I simply like this app.. It's like marking my moments to the memory directly.. I can attach photo or videos with my notes.. So I am double happy today.. Thanks to the developers... 💐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful Experience! I had a subscription for a year as I wanted to unlock the premium features, however I saw the photos unaligned and unappealing, which I reported as well. After a day, I requested for a refund for the remaining 11months, but theu insisted that they will not do any refund. Their ""refund"" page is a joke ""To avoid confusion we do not do refund, but you can check if you are eligible"". They wont even acknowledge the faulty features of the app being the reason for your cancellation."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app I've seen in years, especially for writer's wanting to journal. Many cool features & the format is grad A. 💯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this on and off to journal. It's easy, intuitive, and great to capture screenshots of life! Would recommend premium!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. V easy to use. Would only say that it'd be nice to turn the additional tags off and on? I don't really care about my ""activity"" setting or ""weather"" and it annoys me that they're all automatically there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This application is very good and had has improvements over time but now I am not happy with it. It has become monotonous and contains too many in app purchase despite me having bought the lifetime premium. I'm monetarily not satisfied with what the app has to offer. Please initiate a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app I have found! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Though this is a paid app, it is worth the money spent. user friendly, can be accessed on multiple devices, many new features apart from the diary writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You can't sign up for multiple journal coach prompts. I want to use the coach for self love and relationship but it removes coach for the opposite one when I sign up for the other one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've searched a lot for the perfect diary app and I'm telling you! This is one of the 2 best options possible. Most likely the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great application!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Simple and efficient for a journaling app. Perfect replacement of your pen and paper diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, great way to keep your thoughts. Like the mood rating"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for a life time membership+android feature. Still, they charged me for one year membership, and never updated the life time membership. Sent few e-mails and no response. Great app, but when it comes to payment, it seems unprofessional and there's no reply from developer and that seems sketchy... so I wouldn't recommend the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app and love that you can add tags and a mood. I wish I could have more moods as well as symptoms and medications."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"honestly i really enjoyed this app, but the problem arised when they kept adding all these different kind of subscriptions. i had already paid for a onetime lifetime subscription which included the use of both phone entries and computer journal entries. but now it wants me to spend extra money even though i spent 25 dollars on the lifetime subscription. so be weary if you think you're getting a good bargain they might just pull the rug from underneath you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't cancel this subscription, google play takes me around in circles! Need a refund too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great organizing tool and notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great app! Very easy to navigate, full features, and intuitive. I open or multiple times a day. The voice recording is brilliant. If y'all don't already have it planned, tags and categories would be lit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I installed the app into my new phone but the syncing did not complete correctly. I have lost the majority of my memories. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for a few years now and I actually pay into the app now because I switched phones and I really do like this app is worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, better than i hoped."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"2.99 a month. Pass."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. So easy to use. Secure and private. Doesn't send a ton of annoying notifications. Well worth the money for all its features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app and life membership is cheap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never kept a diary or journal before, but have been reading more about how powerful it can be. I had a look at some apps out there, and after reading reviews and comparing screenshots, Journey won out for me. Just over a week in and I'm enjoying it so far, am also trying the 7 day free trial (though doesn't work om the pc version after unlocking on the app from what I tried which is unfortunate, as wanted to see how it was doing entries that way), just focusing on making it a daily habit 😊👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like, I use it daily for journaling. I wish the recording is available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it being simple. Nothing complicated."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app also PIN protected and very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how it automatically saved the page when you chage screens."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have changed my ratings back to 5 stars! ❤ Thanks for the developers who helped me fix my problem😊. I have had troubles syncing and attaching multiple media at one journal entry before. But now, my problem has been resolved. I just didn't know howBut the team helped me out and guided me how to fix it. And it worked! 🙂. I am really having so much good time making journal entries, 😊. It calms my mind esp. During stressful stuations. Thanks alot ❤. God bless your team 😇. More power ❤👍💪"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Organized. I enjoy this app. Its not bad I have no complaints 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using the app and desktop application for 2years and use it mostly to journal on the go when I have a moment of time. I appreciate the convenience, it's easy to use, and the stats."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love every thing about this app, apart from 1 thing... the constant advertising of going premium every time I log on. I understand you want to advertise but can we cut it down? thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app seem like a great app but if you care about privacy and where entries my be stored you may want to look elsewhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for building good habits!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a pretty good app, my biggest issue tho is the constant bug on the smart word keys? Whatever that's called, the bolding, italics, bullet points etc. For example, I'll use bold on say a title, and I'll begin typing a paragraph, I'll check to see if bold or italics is on, and depending what I used last. As soon as I type that first letter, bold comes back on, or I'll type a word and as soon as I hit space, the whole word changes to bold and italics and it'll stay stuck on that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I definitely loved the app. It's just that everytime I use the sync feature, some of my entries disappear. I think more than 300 entries has disappeared, but it might just have been my fault. It's still pretty sad though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for my health tracking 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always have random thoughts on mind and I remember I have this and I write it down"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Downloading diary app after watching Kini No Nawa (Your Name) Japanese anime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app for about a week. This is the best journal app! 9 Dec: I have supported this great developer by paying them the money that they deserved"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Truly the best journal in the class. Masterpiece, beautifully done! I was finding a journal to vent my frustrations and disappointment in my life. I felt that my life was tumbling down. And then I found Journey. Journey has been my good friend ever since. I love it so much. It helped me to get out of my depression. Now, I have realized how beautiful life can be. I write them all down in this journal. I will keep it as long as I can. A 5 star app! You should try it too! Update: I've been using it as a covid19 quarantine diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wrote a review yesterday. Apparently they didn't like it so they deleted it? A lifetime membership is a scam. They still want more money. After paying for life and being hounded for more money every time I open the app I tried to ask why with only generic responses saying I had to pay monthly. After leaving a 1 star review they offered to give me a year's worth of service for free? I PAID FOR LIFETIME! Their website offers other app comparisons. I'm trying them out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Continuing to love this app after several years. It is smooth in operation and now I use voice input for the text I find it quick enough to bother to make entries. Backup to Google drive is a good safeguard too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am well aware of the way Google and subscriptions work. I am also well aware that when I joined the app it said it will let me know 2 days before the trail would end incase you are unhappy with the app. This did not happen. You took payment when I didnt even use the app. Other apps email in advance so you can unsubscribe. I will be taking this further as that £30 was my food money as a carer on minimum wage"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I only have the free version but hopefully next month I can begin paying for the Pro version. Thank you for creating this pristine journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app with plenty of features, would it be possible to store a certain location as a custon location for future entries?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i can't buy premium HAHAHA but I'm using this for 4years hihi I love this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Looks good but cant get past the pass code as it keeps freezing at that point i will try again in a few weeks to see if this issue is fixed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hi. I actually accidentally downloaded this apps. And it is charged to my phone bill. How to cancel this? Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. But there is a problem when using bullets with ""Right to left text"", it is treated as ""Left to right text"". When I remove the bullets everything becomes fine. I hope that you get it fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it.very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal. Don't have to start over when I switch or upgrade my phone. It doesn't lose data. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app out there. I especially like the option to audio record logs. Try it out. You won't regret it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me in many more ways than I could have imagined! An absolute life saver! 5 Stars all the way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good, in Journaling just what I was looking for, nice Diary I fixed the mic problem with it in everything is good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Before I even figured out how to use the app and to appreciate its features I was pushed to pay to upgrade with a popup ad with timer (60 secs to make a decision based on what? I DIDN'T EVEN GET THE CHANCE TO LOOK OVER THE APP!?) I clicked away cause no thanks, next page, another reminder to purchase a membership. Click another icon, same thing. I mean I really do support app creators but give me a second to understand the experience before pushing me to buy it or just make it pay to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is my secret dairy with password. If you need an app-kind notebook and want to keep your notes secret, that's the best! It allows you to add all kind of media to your notes. That's what I search. If you do not want to pay, you can use limited version which is also useful. Thank you:)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Works flawlessly on all of my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Useless application, limited options unless you pay. I get that making an app from scartch is hard needs lots of resources, but even when trying to make text bold an interesting pop up appears telling me that i should pay in order to get access to a basic bolded text. Amazing, ty. Never gonna try this app again & never gonna recommend it to anyone I know."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"When you're thoughts are overwhelming and you need something to write it down, this is it. It does a good job. They could work on their voice recording, picture taking and video functionality though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It’s a amazing app. I like it. It is so much helpful. I downloaded many app for writing like dairy, in every app I faced many problems. But It is really good. I write on it when i wish,I also use lock on it for protect, It has also backup sytem,I also can add photos in my writing.There are many feathers on it.I hope everyone will like it. Thanks you so much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. It works well with my voice input which saves me time doing my journal entries. Very well organized and aesthetically pleasing. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for over 2 years and love it. I even copied my travel journals from several years back which I wrote on MS-Word to this app. A bit of a chore but I enjoyed reading them again on Throwbacks. Can you update your app so we can re-arrange the order of photos please ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, would like to be able to capture audio as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid app with 7 day trial think before downloading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using the app for a couple of years now. I like that you can add photos etc, its on my phone so always handy. Makes keeping a diary easy as pie."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to keep your daily journal. I recommend this to all who writes diary everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great wee app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is better as a journal diary. I hope you focus more on this than trying to be a planner app since there is a lot of competition in that already. Thanks! Just my opinion. Take this with a grain of salt."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I paid this with premium one time fee and it's already more than 3yrs now.. So far I'm still using it and love it still."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good design and really easy to use! Everything I wanted in a journaling app. I also like how I can back date entries in case I forget to journal one day. The only downside is the upsell ads are very frequent, but it's a small price to pay since I'm using the app for free!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this very useful. Its my e-diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love how easy it is to use this app. Adding pictures makes it wonderful. I do wish I could add more than one video at a time, but that is literally the only thing I dislike and the only reason I didn't give 5 starts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its nice to enjoy life journey.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is awesome to be able to save files and videos to an organized chronological order. Sometimes you want a journal entry of a video of you and family. And sometimes you want to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"YOUR ENTRIES DO NOT AUTO SYNC! I had this app for 3 years. Moved from a Google phone to a new Google phone with a Google email address. The entries are supposed to be autosynced with the Google cloud. I lost 3 years of entries. I have been told repeatedly by the customer service that it is automatic, but they are gone. Not sure what automatic means. They have not been able to tell me. I am writing this review in the hopes it does not happen to anyone in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is everything! Whenever I wake up at 3, 4, 5a.m. with ideas or thoughts...I open Journey. It's easy to use and has nice features. I've had the app since last June and have never had an issue...I love this app...Thank you Journey Still going strong with journey app! I even pay monthly to have extended features. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary app! I love the features and the UI is easy to use. The helpdesk is amazing! They really send helpful feedbacks and assistance. Really enjoying the app, the premium is also worth it! Highly recommend it! :) I would love to thank Cassandra for going above and beyond with assisting me♡ all of my concerns were addressed, she was helpful and very easy to communicate with. Thank you again Cassandra :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awsome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not a fan of journaling. Always thought of it as a chore. But with this app it's simple easy and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Probably a good app, but didn't want to go through Google Pay as I uninstalled, now both."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to keep track of all your thoughts every day.... Or not if you don't want to! Love that you can add photos and selfies!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best but Paid version to be charged on basis of types of services one avails... Rs.500-750/yr slabs needs to be made"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad customer service, don't respond to billing issues. Update: customer service does not respond to any emails or billing services. Disappointed. Update: no one responds ever, super bad customer service!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using the free version for a while and liked it so much that i just got myself the lifetime premium subscription. Best part would be the clean and simple UI, ability to attach photos and stuff to each entry, and sync across all devices and server so that the data is safe. Recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A quick journal entry with tags and gps. Great eco-friendly journal in your pocket. Been using for a few years. Would recommend to everyone who journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ease of this app. I feel like I can finally keep a journal like I should because I have it right in my pocket all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app except for the annoying membership pop-up after I already paid for Lifetime premium membership years ago. Nice lay out and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. No matter where I am at, anytime I hear God speak to me, I open this App and write down everything I hear God say. I have lost my phone once since I started doing this, and when I got my new phone, I signed into journey and every note was there. This app has been a blessing. I love going back and rereading the things I got to spoke to me, and this app makes it easy to do that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Literally the best app I have used in my entire life. No,I don't have any association with the creators but this app have saved me. I keep track of mental health, food intake, hygiene, homework, ideas for art and business, alongside what the app was originally meant for. I've been recommending it for 2 years. As someone who is 22, living mental health issues, trying to make it in film....all I can say is THANK YOU for making the app I was looking for my entire life. Review coming to YouTube soon"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"to export my data even download I must pay, the app is good don't get me wrong but subscription based approach is a bit wild in my opinion"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I write to demand that the my account is credited back with the amount debited for yearly subscription, because I had unsubscribed from the premium plan some months back before the actual renewal date. I see this as an fraudulent act and it is not acceptable. Please refund back my money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really a good app for morning journaling. Nothing thats ever too annoying, no ads (or there are but they are just so not visible). Would recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Flexible and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app! I have a hard time writing in bed as holding a journal while writing on it is just clunky. This is much more preferable. If you are reading this, be sure to write the code to your notepad as well as your phone's passcode so that, as unfortunate as it is to imagine, if something were ever to happen to you, your journal would be accessible to your loved ones to read."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've used Journey for about half a decade now and i have to say it's the prime application when it comes to writing on Mobile. However i do have some grievances for this app. You can't adjust the indents of numbered lists, this is a bit annoying especially if you want the numbered list to be on the same level as what might write above it like a title. More recently, with the new update you cannot enter on a word without spacing first, which is a bit annoying when writing alot at a time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It works ! Nice to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Application has many selections to let tje moderate advanced literate literary writer have coach to inlist new remarks and creations of their own talent. System upgrades ZZMD in analysis are advance culture and literature for screen play or novel writers in bullentins or theatreactivist. Google is proud sponsor of Journey and microsoft doesnt have listing in the store of it thereof.Creations are thought of by the writer and partitions are a bodily standard to making relevances nome in material."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app, I just wish it were a little cheaper to upgrade. What I mean is that it has helped me, but do to my health and inability to work, I wish they had a program for low income people so they can take advantage of the upgrade"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app for daily journalling! Super easy to use, user-friendly! I used to use daylio for tracking my moods, but the space for writing anything about your day is so small. This app is nice because you can write about your day AND put your mood in! Also, I keep losing my physical journals, so it's nice to have one on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only membership can access app on PC, such trash app and blood sucker."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great. It gives me too many features that are useful. But a suggestion I would like to give is to add a note tab, where we can make notes also (like notes app)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Love the ability to add 10 pictures per day and as we are snowbirds, i love being able to add our location to each day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's too much better and great idea for a journiest ....I love it ❣️😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved this apps. I use this everyday. #winningstreak"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The space is not working, would you please fix it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service, slow response time, difficult to cancel subscription and edit payment method. I would choose another journaling option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a good app. All your secrets are private with an app lock. It's great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it! Just wish it had habit tracking. Is there any chance this feature might be added in the future?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a good app. The layout is very neat and structured."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey since 8th grade that was like 8 years ago and I'm really happy that I used this platform because it saved so much of my memories and writings. I hope more people can enjoy the convenience this app offers. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I wish I could attach more than 10 photos or 1 video. Furthermore it would be nice to change the order of pictures or insert them directly into the text. All in all a good app, but due to these missing features I might look for another journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very minimalist, and secured."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just the way a digital diary should be!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Trusted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is intuitive, easy to use. I like that I can attach photos to my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mein kaafi samay se ye app use kar rha hu. Almost april 2017. Abtak mujhe kbhi ese nhi lga ki dusre app pr switch krna chahiye. Mere pass premium version hai aur ismein maujood features diary entry ke liye paryapt hein. I am happy with it. Thanks Team Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it for 5 years now. Go to jounal app now. Clean, minimalistic and the web interface is good too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. ""Journey"" changed my life forever. Before using this app I did love to write diaries but often I couldn't get some alone time or enough time to write everything down. So I stopped writing in a diary. But fortunately one day I found it. And trust me, I tried a lot of apps but none of them worked for me. But ""Journey"" is just perfect for me. Because once signed in with my email, even if the app gets deleted my entries still stays secured. That is the reason I love this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like every other app now, you have to subscribe, so not for me, don't mind a one of payment. I used to use this when it first came out, now deleted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does its job well, i do hope we can get some more formatting options though. Edited: it's amazing now, i'm using it as a medicak journal to keep track for when I'm checking up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wow Simply Great Stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love my journal. I can post for myself everyday and it helps me stay positive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Lifetime membership is too too costly. You can earn more if you reduce the price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is very convenient to use with a simple UI. Best part is this will get the job done but it would have been way better if the free version had some more basic functionalities like changes to text (size, bold, font etc). That would be perfect. A small request: Make the look and feel a bit actually-dairy-ish. That would make the app feel more homecoming."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for making life changes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"How do I reset my passcode on the app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using for more than a year. Even spent the time to copy and paste all my entries from the previous journal app I used. This is simply the best there is!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal for self reflections"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You should state that this is a trial."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a beautiful app. The environment is inviting, very well designed. So I decided to get the paid version and is even better. Free was good, paid is better. It's easy to use and it flows."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its easy to use and I can use it on different devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful as a work journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"smooth!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well featured, clean design, intuitive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Monthly fees. No thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this journal! Perfect way to capture Life moments as they happen. Great companion to our Immersive Journaling Efforts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have had the app for a long time mainly to track symptoms but also to rant. I love that it keeps things in order"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. I have been using it for several years now. in addition to saving my thoughts I can also save pictures and web links. Tagging the entries is helpful for pulling related ideas together later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well for what I use it for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app in loss prevention duties I use it to track record and document people that I come in contact with the ability to use tags as a way of locating license plates and offenders quickly is super convenient for me especially on cases that normally I would not document because they are minimal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's comprehensive in what it can contain"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is the only journaling app I use, and I have previously used several. Everything is working great. Yet, there is a problem for this so-called ""cloud journaling"". This takes too much space because it retains all photos and videos in local storage, albeit invisible. Still takes space Any ways to make all the photos and videos truly on the cloud?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Misleading pricing model. I paid full membership plus for two platforms, still don't have all features unlocked. Clean UI although not many feature, most importantly no templates. Unfinished Window app: tooltips without description but IDs instead; Unintuitive adding of pictures; overall seems like rookies made the windows app. Bot-like answers for bad reviews. They nudge you to give them five stars, but if you don't, they won't submit your review, but transfer you to feedback page. Not nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am going through my free trial now of my premium. I am very interested in the concept and like the layout so far. However, am I to understand the coaching prompts and articles are not available on the desktop Windows app for Journal? If a developer could let me know, it would be appreciated!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! Helps me to journal my thoughts quickly without even using a pen. It's nice to just say your thoughts outloud as well, to help find clarity in our complex lives!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App used it since 2016 ✔️✔️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoy the privacy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I needed and more"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this journal. I stop to reflect and add my daily life plus pictures. It's helping a lot during these trying times."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app but predatory IAP practice. I can't even open the app without a ""limited time offer"" that is clearly not limited as it's there every time I open the thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ground your thoughts, grow your life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like historical entry review features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for journaling. Simple, easy to use. Great value"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Glad I didn't pay actual money for this app. I will be cancelling before it renews."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy and beautiful way to keep track of all your thoughts, memories, dreams and desires."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is really the best journaling app of all.Really like the app layout and features provided like attaching audio,image etc. However it keeps asking for wifi in order to sync on other platforms even if one device is running on wifi and other on mobile data. Five star rating would be if I can sync without any hazzle on all the devices. Kindly solve this issue. Annoying part of the app: I have purchased lifetime premium membership but it still keeps on asking for buying another membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, love this app ,its stable ,simple and reliable,serving my purpose well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: have been enjoying this app for 2 months now, and I still love it! Money well spent! My first week of this app, and I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lifetime Member, but still get spammed for premium upgrade? I bought the lifetime Premium in 2017. I believe they have added more features and now they are pushing an annual subscription which I'm not interested in. If it was in the bottom corner somewhere, that would be fine, but it pops up every single time I open it - and I already paid to be premium! Also, I used to be able to use headers and bullet points, and now that doesn't work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I rated it a 5☆ because it saves when you change a screen. I lost notes with other similar apps that I had tried over the years. With Traumatic Brain Injury, it is a blessing when I forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"These people know all my dirt"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not yet used but it seems to do what it says on the tin."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A very good app. Would suggest to the developers to enable the app to save automatically on closing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary/journal app I've found. Really quick and easy sync to the website, locked with password or biometrics, and easy to just write stuff but also options for recording mood and tracking that stuff. Does bug you to upgrade quite a bit, but I've gotten used to closing those. Also no dark mode unless you upgrade but eh it's fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's so good 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far, paid for a8$ phone only version in app and I'm enjoying it very much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great Journal app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the perfect journal on your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's there when I need to jot down a new verse or rhyme it just leave my thoughts to be used later. On that point it's good to have, but being shut off when the payment isnt there that sucks cause in one moment something that needed to be put on paper was lost in a moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Does it not have backup capabilities? I got a new phone and lost everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"♡ Lovely Idle Iconicism. ♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app for anyone looking to just write for themselves.I began using it when I faced issues with carrying and filling my personal journal unless I was at a desk.Journey has definitely helped with that!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Growth motivated"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"From me to you loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There is so much I like about this app. One of my favorites is the ability to dictate my journal entries. Game changer!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App. Only thing for me to make it better, is if it had a spell checker built in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is by far, the best Journaling app ever. Period."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write in my journey alot. It's helps keep track of my memory's and feelings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Provide category option, it's essential for every journal otherwise it's a wonderful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. It helps me organize my thoughts and it is good for me to go back and view what I was thinking on certain days and various periods in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like to add good memories in this app. I keep up with my daughter's first experiences here to. I can write more than a regular calendar! Everything so far is good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this all-in-one app which integrates objects like video and images into the diary entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app! easy to use, can download anywhere and so simple. just a great way to memorialize some of my kids' accomplishments for a busy mom!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolute best journaling app. It allows me to not only write journal entries but allows me to add photos which is sort of like scrap-booking. Ever since I got this app, and began to use it...it has put my mind and heart at ease. Thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works perfectly, have been using, need to def use a lot more. Fantastic way to keep thoughts and reflect. Love it amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. I can speak to text my feelings and I know that I have recorded them and I feel better after I have done so. It has made everything so much easier to just put it in the journal and move on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to write down your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good product"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I like how I can add photos and videos to it. Great to jot down my memories since I lose notebooks around the house."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's an ok app, but they spam the shlt outta you when opening and closing it. Not worth the headache, will find another option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!!! Perfect pretty much. Has a password protection, can back up journal entries multiple different ways, good looks, can add pictures and stuff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the interface and the features. But i hate those membership plan."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I never thought I would journal but this makes it easy. I like it and I'm able to reflect on past days and appreciate growth. It's easy to use and quick."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app helps you track your progress through journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I gladly paid for the subscription; it's one of the best looking journal apps, and it packs a lot of useful features! Biggest bonus is you can use the web interface and it all syncs with the app perfectly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am very pleased ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, does everything you need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. It helps to get ones thoughts out in writing. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy with the app so far! I've been able to actually maintain journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"A really nice app. There are too many annoying pop-ups though. I was considering buying the lifetime premium for 9 dollors but then the price went up to 89 dollars! Isn't that just too much for an app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app, user friendly 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app really easy to use secure with your fingerprint. You can have pictures which make the general fun and look at later and probably more fun for others to read when I kill over."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great product, excellent UI and very functional, love the export feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. It's everything you could want to journal on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years now, it continues to get better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great way to get your thoughts out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The free version is only for seven days? Wow very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, syncs with all my Android AND iOS devices. Handy for keeping memories that are searchable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Got a new phone and I lost everything even though it said my memories were backed up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use,makes it easy to find any notes if needed. Very organized and handy. Also my favorite part is that you get to set a pin to lock it so only YOU can access YOUR private notes or details."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"really great user experience. was hoping to find a journal app that allowed free form, like arranging images and stickers on a page, almost like the freedom you get when editing slides but couldn't find anything like that so I settled with this. it's been good so far but my only issue is that when I want to add images, the Gallery option does not show all the images in my phone (only shows pictures up to a certain date) so I have to use the File option instead."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wrote a massive entry and when I went out for it to save it gave me a big exclamation mark and didn't save anything I wrote .. how annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love diary and afraid lost the backup. So this online cloud diary really convenient to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"100€ for the lifetime membership, i.e. having access to a desktop app?? You must be kidding me. 🤬"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app! Request: please add sketching feature with the Samsung S Pen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a journal! I've been using this app for awhile but I forget to write anything, then all of a sudden the app will pop up with a memory for me to look at. I love when it does that, reminds me of things I'd forgotten and also reminds me to write something again. Really this is a great no nonsense journal keeping app! Try it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very much impressed with this app. I would like to thank the developer for giving us such a nice thing. Also I am grateful to my boyfriend from whom I got this app. With a passion for writing own journals, poems and stories this is quite helpful along with saving memories. I hope this app remains free always and I continue to get the service as usual."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that it sync across multiple devices. Very easy to use and great app to use. Thanks! (Update) I hope different font styles are available soon. That would be great to see to have a little more customization on each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use for quick thoughts long notes. or paragraphs. Works well on phone, tablet, or desktop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've used this app off and on and it's a fantastic journal app. But being able to use only tags to organize everything drives me nuts. The Journey team needs to add categories along with tags for more organizational options. Add that and this app would be perfection. Until then, I literally can't use it. Please add categories. That would help my mental health when journaling. I'm serious."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reinstalled after few months to find the app much better in terms of the developer not releasing updates every five minutes. The stability of the app is good - and you now get chance to become used to it. The whole concept is very nice and the UI is clear and easy to use. It'll do much more than just give you a blank page to write onto - there are a number of really nice, useful features and choices. I'm pleased that the app is finally free from tinkering about with it. 👍🤗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient not invasive.generally helpful all-round"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice application and easy-to-use interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app and love the way it syncs with all my devices from iPhone, Mac Windows and Chrome too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love journey. Been using it for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for about a year now. I've only used it on my mobile device. I imagine laptop it lays out a little different. But I'm able to use different font and different colors for each paragraph, if I choose. I can add photos or a video clip. However I opened up two accounts under different emails. I'd like to find a way to combine them. Other than that I highly recommend it. 😎"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic way to keep track of a variety of topics, all at the same time if desired with the use of tags. I've been trying to get my husband to write some sort of journal or diary for years: now he can't complain that it would hurt his hands!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. It is perfectly safe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app it's a stress reliever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app to keep memories alive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for over a year. It's now a habit and I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just get it.. its superb."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app. It does everything I want. But I am cancelling my subscription in the hope of using the free version or another app for free. Why pay more than the cost of a good Journal?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I tried to export the journal to a new email account; exportation is only supported with a premium account. So I signed up for a 7-day trial with auto-renewal in order to export my journal... but was unable to import the journal into the new email account. Now frustrated, I tried to turn off the auto-renewal so I wouldn't be charged for a functionality that didn't work. No dice. The link provided in the help desk was 404-ed, the link provided in the desktop app didn't work. In short, fraudulent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i prefer the markdown instead of rich text editor! very inconvenient for html users, would prefer to have the old version back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like how I could print my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such an easy way to keep all of our family memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is what I was looking for in journal. Easy to write or paste text and pictures and print. Has a lot of additional features which I haven't used yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app. So nice that I can add pics, audios, videos, links to my entries. It's so personal and meaningful. I wish it hadn't deleted some of my videos though. They were working and now it shows the entry is empty. Overall, best app I've found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app. It helps me orientate myself everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"At first I loved the app and made entries daily. Then all of sudden a question pops up in my head, ""what if the developers reads these daily enteries"". I never felt right since. I purchased the membership but I dont feel I have 100% privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mantap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent..I love it n write it while travelling on bus.some times the ads are a bit worrysome espwcially qhen you in the middle of thinking writing something."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app to keep your memories safe and private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome Journal easy to add entries like having a diary on your phone. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It is the longest running journal I've kept so far. 🤞 I love that you can add photos, videos, or even social media posts automatically through Zapier. Highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app... Very user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pay wall"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its great to be able to right in here and not lose it. I can put pictures in my jornal entry and videos. Its really great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping pain diary for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"2017: No problems or glitches and I am months in 2020: now I am years into this and still 100% satisfied"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Another good app u must have. Its a fresh new digital diary with a lot of customization. I've downloaded evernote and yet i still download this because of how Journey have different user interface thats more pleasing and features that other apps dont have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Doesn't say there is a subscription fee. That's just wrong 😡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just simple... Nothing complicated"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was more of a pen and paper type, which I still do on occasion but I love the fact I can ad photos and that will autoadjust the location of my entry to match the photo so I can show and speak to the moment. I can also journal on my driving commute which is always where I'm unloading the days thoughts and feel inspired. It's so easy and will always be able to be found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works for it intended use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Privacy and video recording? The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I dont like some of the permissions it has"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and such a great way to document those special moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Journaling is therapeutic. I find I relax once I have put my thoughts in the journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"6-11-17 Journey is journaling for the 21st century. Update: 10-27-2020 Okay, it's still a great app but the fact they are removing features (specifically connection to Google maps and Google photos) is getting frustrating... If you haven't posted in a while and have taken over a certain amount of pictures you can't put them in your post unless you download them to your Google drive... Starting to not want to use this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Wish there was more to do on here for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Does what it is supposed to do, kind of pricey as such."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app but I can't figure out how to get back into my journal after having to reset my phone. I forgot pin??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It kept asking"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love to be able to vent freely using this app. I feel comfortable enough to believe it's trusted and safe. Don't change a thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for over 5 years now. I love having my reflections and dreams in one spot, and with me all the time so I can record inspiring stories or interesting news. I can sign into ot on any of my devices and I love the Throw Back memories from each new day. It reminds me I am moving forward 😌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App I'm finally Journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that I can write and it's protected by my established pin number. It also reminds me which I often need on account of being absorbed in other matters. I can review and edit as well. Very helpful to my journaling on my personal recovery, situations, and feelings, whether good or bad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite journalling app. I used to jump back and forth between journalling platforms until I found Journey all those years ago. Thank you for making such an easy to use platform that also syncs so well with all my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Have been using these app for a long time premium is affordable for the extra features but the photos I take using the app doesn't seem to save in my gallery anymore have to manually download it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app,been using since 3 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"As a now former subscription user, Customer service sucks here! I tried to reach out for information and help through email and Facebook, no one bothered to respond back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using the app for a few years now and like it a lot. What would make it perfect for me is to (1) be able to delete tags from the tag list; (2) have an option to add personal journal prompts templates; (3) advanced search options - with multiple tags or words, within a date range etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am really inspired to write. The coaching is great to get you going. This is a great UI and there are multiple ways to access your journal entries. LOVE it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Super functional. I use it to document so many things. Also love the new feature that shows you what you have written in years previous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keep a diary is good gor your mental health."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THIS IS A GREAT APP! I have tried a few different journaling apps and this one is definitely the best out of all of them!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use. I'm using it to document my medical journey. I struggle with time management as it is. I wanted an app that was simple at first but I could grow to take full advantage of on my own time. This app does that for me. I can make my entry as personal & fun by adding photos or just quickly jot down a few sentences. It has been a blessing to me. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really love this app, I would vouch for it💯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the convenience. I wish that I could add pics/video from a PC, not just the app on a phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very intuitive it's easy to use and I really like all of the different little features that they have. It works. No hiccups confusion. It's just a really easy app to navigate. I need that because I have Fallen ill because of a medication I need to keep a journal of it. And I can't deal with complications right now. One of the side effects from the medication is I'm blind in one eye and this app is still so easy for me to use and navigate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Suggestion: hope it will support IFTTT (e.g. after completing a workout, that session could be automatically synced to Journey, and the user could annotate that session as per usual). hint: a competitor of yours, D.. ... allows IFTTT integration ;)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I find it useful for writing down my thoughts and what I've been feeling. Been struggling with personal issues and it is a good tool to put everything down in a organized app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the easiness of use and how it saves your posts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I've had it for 5-6 years and everyday I get reminded of what I was doing on this particular date. It really does add value to my life. I am glad I downloaded it (and sorry for waiting 5 years to review 😅)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"For Android (LG G8X) I wish I could write tags with space for multiple words. Also, I can review only recent photos, not all gallery photos. And I found I cannot add photos in other folders than in gallery as I attach using ""files"" option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is easy to use I'm not happy about how many times it asks me to buy a membership when all I want to do is just journal and keep track of what's going on with my medical treatment once I'm done with my treatments I would like to use it just as an everyday Journal it's always good to look back and see where you were before and how you've grown all in all I think it's a great app but y'all really need to drop it with the membership pushing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I normally only use the web app for writing stuff but when you don't have access to a computer this app acts as a fallback so I rarely use it. However having done so recently I found it a nightmare of a user experience. I shouldn't have to enter my passcode every time I change screen that's just overkill. Add an entry, passcode, subscribe to service, passcode, add an entry, passcode, then finally an edit screen. You've got to shirt this out..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best App for Journal keeping!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far the best experience I had with journaling. I am using it to write my thoughts and to talk to myself also to get to know myself better. We spend all our lives with ourselves and most of the time we don't dedicate any time to improve the person we were yesterday. This app is helping me a lot. Just hope someone enjoys it as much as I am. 🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really great for writing my thoughts in and it's easy to use I'm not looking for something intricate just something I can press a button start typing and it save it for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All inclusive. Inspiring . Zero functionality issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep a record of your travels."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app on android. Just switched from dayone to journey. Interface is good. I have two request. If you are charging 1800+ rupees for premium then provide unlimited cloud backup like other app does or integrate one drive (office 365) which offers 1 TB storage. Plus bring down the subscription to 1000 rupees per year. Even evernote and dayone charges 1500 to 1600 with huge cloud backup. If I have to purchase google drive extra storage paying yearly then what is this subscription for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, wish more stuff was free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it constantly. Like the fact I export my journal weekly. Makes me feel like if the app ever becomes unsupported I can still keep my stuff. Paid the subscription cause it's so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I didn't care for this app and deleted it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Big believer in journaling write a lot on paper haven't used this hardly ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has excellently well designed UI and UX. Really nice !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great. But would love .to be able to "" Doodle"" on the page."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I feel that the dark mode should not be under a pay wall. While the app might have features that might merit the premium version, I can accomplish the same thing with inverted colors. Because I was only using the app to take some notes, I will look elsewhere to do this. Honestly the automatic backup seems very convenient, and if I were to come back it would be because of that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app if you stick with it (stay motivated!). Missing 1 star because while the free version is more then sufficient, the app is always throwing ads at you to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"V good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The basic features i use are okay...however I find going outside of this, a less user friendly - too complex - experience than I feel it should be and I feel the pricing is exorbitant (should be a reasonable one off payment system). Am also interested to know, if I dont sign up for another year, do I still have access to all my data?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Being using it for years and I haven't looked for any app similar cos this Journey app does it all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a perfect app for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No end to end encryption. You should be aware that anything you write in this app could be used against you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this since nakakatamad magsulat ng nararamdaman mo sa soc med..atleast dito private..kaya 5stars.👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been very happy with this free app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me alot with stress and depression. I love that I can journal my feelings and then look back at my good and bad days to see my progress. I wish you could work with the coaches portion on more than 1 subject. Thats the only issue I have with the app. Its a great tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"What's with the need for membership? I can't do one entry without it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app, for the first time I've been constant on keeping a diary. I just don't like the simplicity of the mood tracker, it only goes from very sad to very happy, no room for angry, fearful, anxious etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's just not enough. I bought a 2tb google photo storage hoping I could use this with it. But the app has random limitations of 200mb and only 1 video per entry...why? I want to record large events and small events. IE we do weekly puzzles and games with the kids lots of laughs i want to record the whole 30mins to an hour event and add it but the app won't let me because of the size. Doesn't matter that I have the space."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app honestly I don't know what I'd do without it it is easy to use and it's very therapeutic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love using this app. I just wish there was an option to easily print a book from my entries. When I save to a pdf file, the photos are so large there is only 1 per page. I would have to print 500 pages. :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app for making quick reminders and shopping lists"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app interface is cool. It has all the features that need in free. Yes you can use it for free also. Last but not least the customer service is superb 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the ease of use. Capabilities I haven't explored yet. It's not intimidating or too overhelming. Perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not too bad thanks Google play store"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It seems like a great app. I love to write and have been terrible with keeping my Journaling goal of writing once a day. I recently just got back into Journaling trying to write physically, and I found it to be too troublesome and time consuming since I don't have any fingers. I don't like that you have to pay monthly or annually, but there is at least an option to pay one lifetime fee. I have one question, is there a way to tell the app where to sync within my Google account?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has been my go to journaling app for whenever I need to jot down some quick thoughts or even just to vent! It has served me well for several years now. I highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very very very nice app ❤❤❤😘😘😘"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the e-journaling platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was using the free version for less than a day and enjoyed it, was offered 50% discount to unlock the full version and once I paid I could no longer use it... Now when I enter my PIN abdvtapbon the plus button to add a new entry, the app just quits."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice having a private place to post thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for expressing your thoughts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool to have, handy to jot down days events. Really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a nurse and I've been using this app to help with my anxiety during COVID19. It helps me to write my thoughts and feelings. I also love I can use pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous journalling app. I've long searched for an app that would let me update from my phone or laptop and save pictures and video along with my musings. This app does that and more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using Journey now for around 2 years. I use it mainly as a photo journal, which works well as I can take pictures then add them all too the app at a later date, as it remembers where and when it was taken"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm changing my rating back to 5 stars. This app is great. But never disconnect the app from Google Drive. I didn't realize the entire journal is stored on there. Google restored my files but it was scary for a bit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great journal. Nice to be able to write out my thoughts on my phone or computer. Have not had any issues for the past 2 years I've been using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app! My only suggestion is adding google maps timelines to the app so I can know where I was EVERYDAY!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. So practical"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always thought that journaling was not for me but later realized through discovering Journey that I just needed a platform that integrated more than just text as well as being simple and non-distractive in its layout. Imagine combining the satisfaction of writing on a typewriter in your favorite warm vacation spot with the feeling of scrapbooking in front of your living room fireplace and then being able to share that with your friends and family. Thank you, Journey creators and developers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using Journey to keep track of my thoughts over time. I don't post to social media, so it is nice to get my thoughts or picture out and revisit. The application itself is clean and well thought-out. I appreciate reminder notifications to remind me to journal when life gets busy. Another great feature is the export so your can back up your journals in a word document."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You call that page in depth? It's 2 sentences and a link to Google! You state that's it's encrypted in storage, but does Google have access to the Journey data, to the keys? Cloud backup APIs are available from many providers across many platforms. Why do you only offer Google? Google privacy policy states that they can use data from Drive for personalised ads/content. So I wrote something about lack of motivation in Journey. Next day, lo and behold, YouTube has motivational videos in my feed!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Don't change a thing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No matter where I tapped it just opened up my keyboard. Also tapping on calendar made it try to get location access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a few years and I am very happy with the ease of use. It stores things well and has a nice widget for quick entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Captures all pertinent data. Great interface... Wish the desktop version was a bit more elegant like the mobile and web version. Otherwise great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for the soul"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"goodest"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love Jouney!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app thank👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Was great until the Google Maps integration died. Can you revamp your in-house location function to include the option to use current location? And if Google integration has indeed gone, remove the button from the UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the free 7 day trial however, I have been bill straight away and now I cannot find a way to get a refund????"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app gives me motivation and a push to release everything that bothers me 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"В целом неплохо. Но я снимала видео через приложение и сейчас не могу скачать его на телефон. Нашла способ. Жаль, что можно только по одному фото или видео добавлять в запись."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journaling. I love the ability to add photos and videos to help record memories. I wish this app allowed users to zoom in on the screen to make reading easier temporarily without changing global device settings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this is great at letting you keep your journal in all of your entries together with photos and videos. Have find it much easier to journal this way but it's not as journaling with pen and paper. It'd be a great way to record a trip. It's also just easier for me to keep my diary in here of the kids because I don't want them to find it. I haven't tried to print it out to see what it looks like because journals are always good to look back at. Overall for an online journal it's great though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app and best purchase I am about to make you can go for it without any doubt."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Dictation doesn't work well in this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app really helps me keep track of my thoughts when I use it and it's easy to go back to a certain date to re-experience memories, workouts, and events!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I did not see or feel the value in the paid version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal app I've come across for Android, even if the full version does feel a little pricey. Developers - I would really like a feature that let you set goals in an area that was separate from a daily journal input. These could then be revisited and kept track of over time. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was very nice 😊👍😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I Like the app, but an ad to upgrade the app pops up every two seconds and that makes me not want to use this app at all...when I'm ready to upgrade I will but I'm feeling harrassed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have not used yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is one of the best app I've downloaded. Highly recommended to download."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The finest app I ever got!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really helpful for me to keep a daily journal of my reflections in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for journaling. Easy to use. Functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Being forced to pay right before I have even tried to use the app is not cool... The promotion offer with a one time ""available with this pop-up only"" with a 60 second pressure timer is again not cool. When a company seems to want the money so badly, us the people tend not want to give it at all - uninstalled! Good luck with your aggressive hustle business model, I would have gladly paid if I had liked the app, but before I got into the interface the POS was in my face, so, no, thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it and i just get to write down my feelings and"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Slick and awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very functional"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This really is the perfect journaling app. Easy to use, and so many great features. I love that I can add photos, videos, moods, weather, and even drawings that might help record my memory for that day! Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it ♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a good app for journaling for those who forgot to bring their materials. It's straight forward and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hate to say it, but I found it difficult to understand. The UI was too hard for me :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this application. I am able to use it anytime and anywhere. It is user-friendly and I love that I can attach photos etc. Great app, thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome experiance"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Was fine until yesterday It will no longer print to PDF. I have cleared cache, data, uninstall, reinstalled, restarted device, Adobe is up to date. I just get ""sorry that didn't work try again"". Annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is simple whaich is very good. But need more feature to make it attractive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journaling app. I love that you can set reminders. my only complaint is that I would love to be able to attach more than four pictures. However, overall, I love this app. I have been using it for more than a year now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app.. very easy to access and use on the fly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app, can easily record all my mental health problems, also use it for notes which makes life a bit more simpler. Paid for the app straight away. Can add photos to your notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"$29/year is a lot of money for such a simple app. I need a more affordable solution."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I like that so far I haven't been limited to input or images added I will continue to use, recommend it, and give it a five star as long as it is this way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the ability it gives us to look back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent tool for keeping tabs of daily memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the import feature. Access from the web is great too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Really, pay? Why do I need to pay you for my journal? I used this app for a couple of years and now I have to pay?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really is a great app. Love the passcode feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't wait!!🤔"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best way to journal any time of the day... my phone is always near me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best one!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Totally money loss, it is just a simple note taking application, nothing new and creative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the experience and simplicity of this app. It sends reminders, and it is very user friendly. I love that I can add photos and more to compliment my entries. So much more than I expected. I've always wanted to start journaling but always does off. So far I'm able to start with this and not feel horrid if I miss a day. Hope to keep this party going."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Feeling like this makes my diary become private, thanks to the passcode I put in. That way, I can have enough privacy in writing thoughts in my journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing interface to log my thoughts and things I want to remember. I feel like it's a safe haven for me to log anything I want to write out or save. Thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing app Only bothering me with that SALE: BUY MEMBERSHIP hundred times in one day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've only had this app a few days and it doesn't work. It keeps stopping . I am allowed to write a sentence or two and it won't alow me to write anymore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Only if it had one time payment forever I would have bought it. Otherwise an exceptional app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really cute App, easy to use, just what I needed :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I DL this app with intent to keep track of my years, months, weeks, days, hours, and minutes plus the seconds.... Cause life is short and a person should do what they can to remembet each moment and memory.. Its a great app and i am enjoying my memories and the discipline ive taken to do it each day.. No,matter what or where i am."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for daily writing habbit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app. I have always liked the idea of Journaling but I find myself not doing it. This allows me to write a sentence and be done. And I can look back a year later and remember days and events and time with friends that I've forgotten."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good, nice features, simple to use, nice interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app but the pop up's and ads are annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this, just need to use it more haha"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the ability to upload photos and the throwbacks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use across all my platforms."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great record keeper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I like not sharing it with others though like my own personal diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After years of searching, I have finally found a journalling platform that's so intuitive, I can't help but use it, I'm so delighted!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing and very user friendly 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've been a premium user for years now and I've been syncing my google drive together with journey and my drive storage was never full. I checked a few days ago and my storage just blew up all of a sudden just to find out that the hidden app data from journey is causing all of this. Why is this happening now? A few years back it wasn't even a problem. Please, please fix this cause I love you using your product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Coming from Day One, this is a great replacement that doesn't require a subscription and has a desktop app available for Windows. The interface is solid and makes Journaling easy. My main complaints are the lack of multi journal support and the lack of template support. The former can be worked around with tagging(which is supported), but the latter cannot. Still, a great app that I hope will keep getting better!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"At first, I was really impressed with all the features offered so I bought a premium membership. However, I'd definitely buy a lifetime membership if I had the ability to record voice entries like the Journify app, which also provides transcripts of the audio recording. Basically, I'd like someone to combine all the features of Journey and Journify into one app. That would be the perfect journaling app and a sure recipe for success!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and I can journal from anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"too much ads in new version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Help me a lot everyday. Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app. I like that I can set a reminder to write. I'm able to download anything that I had written earlier with pictures or other attachments and keep it all here in one place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app to write a dairy I liked it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After writing a long paragraph and exiting my input to save, an error came out and erased all my progress. Very great. This is sooooo useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have to say this App is incredibly amazing!! I really love it. This app will be the best and perfect one at what it does, as a Journey. I do really appreciate the great work you put into it. To people who are thinking to buy this app, I did and it was worth every dollar!!! Keep it up. My five stars go to you devel team. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app but wish it would stop with the pop ups!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling is always something I have wanted to do and it helps to get notified everyday to remind me to take some time for me 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app. Been using this for over a year now. My only issue is that it keeps asking me to upgrade every single time. I'll buy when you stop pestering me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely smashing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been using this for years. I bought a lifetime premium then, and I love how it improved over the years. I'm dissapointed about how they changed their membership details though. I used to write entries in my laptop via their PC version. But now, they're selling separate licenses per mobile and device, which means, even though I have bought a lifetime premium membership, I am only premium in my android. I won't be able to use their services in my PC even though I bought a full membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user-friendly. I use it to write down my goals daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice. Free adds. easy. secure. ijust like it. simple apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app and great for journaling as well. Its worth getting and trying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: Dev responded within hours of my original review and advised me of options I didn't know were available and would work for me, therefore I'm changing my review from a 3 to a 5. Thank you for the response. Original review: Looks nice but I'm not looking for a subscription service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Its simple to use, convenient for jotting down and totally serves the purpose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i would like my refund to be processed i am really sorry my daughter accidentally purchased the app need the money back badly please"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, goes where I do and is great to map and track thoughts, moods and even the temperature. I really like the journal prompts they are incredibly thought provoking and as I found journalling very difficult to start with they have helped me articulate and build a habit of journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paywall to use bold text? Ridiculous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the experience. Great for the mind to keep track of things so you can reflect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"keep losing my media"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its a nice app. But in the price we pay, we should have some options available to color or highlight some text and with different font size. Also then and there poping up of option to upgrade and have membership, i don't like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The free option is basically all you could ask for from a free option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app since almost 3 to 4 years. It syncs really well on all of my devices and im happy to journal my life using this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use. Includes mood, activity and time of day + photos Changes dates easily when writing retrospectively"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well even with the free version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Was an OK app but when I went for help because the notifications only popped up when I opened the app (not helpful if I need a daily reminder) and when I reached out for help a bot naked Cassandra didn't read my information told me to go to settings and turn on reminders and then closed the ticket. The bots then spammed me ""Buy premium to get rid of ads"" and ""Turn on daily reminders by going to settings."" I would have been fine with 'Idk'. It's the inability to use reading comprehension for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Yeah everything works fine. Till it doesn't. Why would you keep a diary? Maybe you might be documenting something you may have to use in the future? Maybe you might want to exported so you can have a file to review? Good luck with that. I have been on my phone and on my home computer for five hours now. Support? Forget it. Pre-populated answers and just a form email. Do not use this app if you need it for proof such as Court hearings or evidence. It works pretty nice if you just want to go back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey's subscription option has some cool features- I am well aware of them. My continued use of the platform without them expresses my disinterest in those- especially since this google account (and another one I use frequently) both bought the platform-exclusive app version. Give me a setting to turn off in-platform advertising, please. (Which is, in inself a very sad thing for a 'Premium User' to ask, but hey, it's capitalism.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it for journaling, task lists, notes and really anything I need to document. Using voice to text is also a beautiful thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love how easy it is and the security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Got it a week ago, so far so good. I did arrange to pay monthly, but the yearly subscription was taken instead. Want to know what happened there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app! So much & More!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far in love with app and I'm only using the free features! Love the look and ease of Journaling from my phone using Journey:Diary Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app for The free version also not having any ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app and the developers are continuously improving it. I love that I can add up to 10 pictures per entry. It also reminds me to quickly add an entry at the end of the day. The help desk is very responsive when I need help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Отличное приложение!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Tried doing journaling in Evernote and Notion but still came back to Journey. It is better to have a dedicated app. Limitation on photos that you can upload, but well, the app is free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What a great Journaling app.. Highly Recommended !! There is a Journal Coach Program that supports your journey to become a BETTER VERSION of yourself! :D Love it & its safe and it kept all your private memories there ❤❤❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is beautiful! Create an avenue for drawing in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, got the lifetime premium version, used this years ago, not sure why I changed to Diary, but I did find it easier to use to go back to find events. The adding photo feature on 'journey' appeals to me, I just wish I could use a bolder text, if I start typing in bolder text, as soon as I make a space it reverts to feint text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful .. enables reminderrs at future dates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it to check my nutrition and workouts. It helps me a lot being able to check previous workouts and get a better feel of what I should do the next days. I love cycling, boxing workouts and using kettlebells and resistance bands and being outdoors. I also like drawing and record that too. This was useful for me getting in better shape, checking that I improve my libido and having health goals to aim for. I like using it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean UI effective across all kinds of devices! Cross platform too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, but lacking a few options I hope the dev team will address. An 'undo' option would be nice. Also a better way to set tags. There is no easy way to see what tags you have set, or how to manage or search them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The reminders help me stay on track with journaling everyday. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the layout and how easy it is to use. Very versatile and comfortable to write on any platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app helps me.documents my daily life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Getting bad, to worst. I deleted my previous review cos I recognise the effort of the devs. But this app is TERRIBLE now. - Replies to feedback are copy-n-paste (similar across feedback); u get immediate response from a BOT when u contact them but wait forever for a human (subscriber here) - Download of images doesn't work right away! Found a bug in their app. - Todo list inside a table turns to bullets - Keeps asking for feedback even if u already dropped one - Discount offers that don't work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to put down random thoughts or texts I get and how I feel at times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me to keep my thoughts and feelings in check. Writing really help oneself to know one better and this app assist you for that. Thank you!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Honestly so far so good it's really simple and the fact that I personally can add whatever it is that I want and capture the moments is great! So far I really love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps in my phone A perfect smart diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Just one thing. When I switched phones, the status does not show 9 bought the app and keeps saying to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! It's super easy to use. I'm not a big journal writer, and I haven't try any other journal/diary app. But this is so nice to use I don't plan to try others so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Samsung Note 10 Plus.. LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH ITS RIDICULOUS. so easy to use, provides unlimited, unstructured or structured template.. love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I decided to get this app as if i tell my froends a secret their mpst likely totbell everyone and my family is uh well im in year 7"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of what's going on in my life when I don't have time to write in my physical Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased this app on Google Store by mistake and asked for a refund. I've mailed them 4 times, but there's no reply from their side. Very poor customer service!! They have blocked me from Twitter. Which company does that? Pathetic!! Have texted them 5 times ...no reply. Will go legal way now ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It gets the job done, it's intuitive and visually pleasing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app.I gave five stars..!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the app so much but let's be honest it's a bitttt to expensive for a journal😂. Would love some new features or something, maybe like a daily affirmation even would be nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app about a couple months now, I use it for stuff to remember, when I'm going thru sum, when I'm tryna rap. Its easy to access nd use but secure just for me. I keep I no matter which phone I get"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks, now clear on license. Appreciative of the support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the Journey ! It's a great way to note your thoughts, reflect and capture memories. I especially love the coach section where they provide meaningful journal prompts based on specific themes such as 'Living a life of purpose' or 'Letting Go'"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that keeps my thoughts well documented"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this app for a year now. Very useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for the product, yet it FORCES me to give it a review on the Play Store. I'm trying to journal, and it takes me out of the app. These kinds of Engagement tactics are are borderline with free apps, but form the hefty subscription this app charges, it's unacceptable. Here's my review that you forced me to make."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"For a start all need to upgrade.... should let us use it first and think about upgrade later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for diary keeping. Would be even better if it had a to-do checklist function. I tend to remember things I should do while writing my diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!! I love the organized layout."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving the extra choices you can add to your entries to liven up your journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it...useful and simplicity itself to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I could not be certain as to whether you had to sign up to get premium privileges or if it was free for basic services. It appears that the app is not a free app and you have to pay. This should be stated in your description and I will be uninstalling this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gosto muito. Bom que pode colocar senha e dá para inserir fotos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Locks you out. No reliable way to get back in. Essentially useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Nice app, but it's not free. 7 day trial and then a fee"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful daily diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app and compare it with Penzu. I never paid for the premium version of Penzu however. It's been a few years since I worked on any serious writing projects so I mostly write down random thoughts and use both the desktop application and phone app. It would be nice if the sync happened automatically because it seems like something that I have to trigger manually. Plus, I kind of don't like having to open a window then click on another button to edit it. Obviously I opened it to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oh! nice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply loved it It's been two years since I've know this app, I've stopped using it sometime don't know why but I've restarted it and now I realize I love the interface which allows you to add your entries. I'm on it whenever I'd like to put down my thoughts or want to say something, I say it in the Journey App. Great work creators!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Downloaded this again after changing devices. Works much better now, but the pop ups for premium are still annoying. They are literally shown a dozen times while I switch between apps, save something or look between entries. Hope you can do something about these."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"How to not rate this such vital app in my life 5 stars?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I retract my previous review due to the way customer support handled my issue. The team is awesome. I absolutely recommend this app to anyone who likes journaling. User friendly, esthetically pleasing, no ads. Have been using it religiously for years and I plan to for years to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ads pop up too frequently, but are easy to dismiss. The app itself is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, really fast and secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This helps me keep my sanity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for journaling! Its easy to use and has options for mood, adding attachments like pictures, and the weather which could all be a part of how you're feeling at the moment. The year subscription to me is worth it and I love being able to use it on my desktop to type if I'm tired of typing on my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not bad for a freebie. Will certainly consider purchasing for my next holiday vacation as I would like the benefit of being able to produce a printed version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app for daily writing and journaling. I love using Journey in so many ways: a to do list, a gratatutde list, a daily diary, etc. Journey allows me to collect my thoughts and organize each entry any way I want. From making a video entry, to snapping photos of important events and even making audio recordings...Journey can do it all. Customer service is VERY responsive if needed. After using the Journey app for about a week, I can highly recommend it to anyone serious about journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy interface, smooth operation, not cheap."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, really helps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very handy 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I like that you can add things like pictures too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"After 2 months. So far so good. Further detail later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one thanks for giving"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app clearly screwed me! I did the 7 day trial and downloaded the app. My subscription was to run out on the end of the 17th. They were having a half off special for a yearly subscription and I went ahead and purchased it before the timer was out on the special. Shortly after I paid the $14.99 I was charged $29.99! After going back and forth with whomever I was speaking with through their help button on the app I'm only getting back the $14.99! I only subscribed BECAUSE OF THE HALF OFF PRICE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super simple and stores everything in my Google drive. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal app that doesn't feel intrusive. Clean interface and easily usable from web or app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Scam!!! This company just takes your money. I never used the app, never even recorded a video, I explained to the company, requested a refund and basically was ignored. Do not use!!! Horrible company!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nicely done cross functional journalling app that fits my needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling ap without all of the distractions that I have found in other aps. It also has a journaling coach for anyone who needs writing prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just saw my yearly subscription renewal come through and I thought about how much I love this app and how it's worth every penny I spend on it. The journal entry screen is simple and useful, with plenty of formatting options. Probably the most important feature for me is the Today screen which shows entries from one, two, three, etc years ago today and the entry from 30 days ago. I've made reviewing those entries part of my daily ritual prior to writing. It has given me such a great perspective on my life and truly helped me to mature as a person. It's simple, but well executed and enhances my daily routine. It's exactly what software should aspire to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journeling. It allows you to see yourself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like being able to attach a picture, but don't like the ads to upgrade every time I open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally caved and bought the premium version. I do love making multiple entries per day, tagging, and being able to search afterwards. It's pretty convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Does not work on desktop or on website."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"dig it. i have no idea why..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the ease of using this application The best part is I can also login from my PC which is very convenient to type on keyboard. Throwback is a nice feature if you have made notes of some insights and ideas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use journal. I've tried writing on a book type journal and never kept it up. This works for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of the most important apps I have. I use to document important moments in my life (happy, sad, challenging, etc.). For many, it's so important to document such life events that can help you remember things in detail later on down the road. There's no way anyone can remember in such a detailed manner everything that went on in a particular moment in one's life. You can document where you were, how you felt, why you felt a certain way, as well as so many other important specifics. Thank you for creating this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"First of, I understand if you cannot do any refund on my subscription. However, I emailed twice to consult this and no one even tried to get back to me. It was stated there if you want an update about the refund, you just need to send an email. Done it twice and no response. As I used to like it, but now, nah."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has helped me track my journey to becoming a better person."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I just paid for Premium, but I am disappointed. Why are the font options located in settings instead of in each entry post? I feel that as a paying premium member, I should be allowed to customize the font for every post, and I should not be forced into such a limited/conformist aesthetic for my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I absolutely love the app and all it's feature's it's a great app. It has helped tremendously! Everything was GREAT with the app until yesterday when I was writing in the morning time. The app crashed went black for a second came back on a second later. I went straight to my saved journals and the journal I was working on never saved 🤨 WASN'T TO HAPPY WITH JOURNEY APP PLEASE FIX!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS JOURNEY I AM ON NOW! 😎🌄😇"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the coach for daily Inspiration"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app that has everything I need in it. It really does feel like a portable diary! After trying multiple journals I found this one and I like it the best so far. 100/5 stars in my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't sign in to my account. Whenever i try, it shows a red wifi icon with a line across it. What's the problem. I'm so disappointed at this point😈😈"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple to use for effective Thought Journalling . The app should let us to categorise or tags and classify the items with Topics and content usage dimensions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app has been of great help to me. I would love to suggest that you consider adding a sort of reward system for those who are consistent with their journaling every day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Colorful and very nice app! It has all the editing features you may need. My special favorite is the ""quote"" format. This way if you have a great quote to start your journal entry you can set it up to look in a fantastic way that draws your eye to that quote you set up for your day. I would like to know how to easily add and remove tags, and how to easily change my profile image thought, you don't make those things easy to do on your mobile apps. You'd get 5 stars if you fix that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, I am still in the 7 day trial experience, but I like what I am experiencing so far. I think I will like to remain. It is becoming a very interesting experience, as i am using the journal to chronicle events of my life, and navigating the site has proved to be good so far.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. I'm journalism home schooling and love you can put pictures on. Easy to show the other parent who's working!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I will not pay to do what I can do free with Pen and Paper. I don't want your paid subscription..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app lets me write when ever i need to its a personal journal in my pocket"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have always struggled with physical journals. This is the answer that I was looking for. Being able to add photos from my phone's gallery just meant the journal was more meaningful... for me atleast."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"too much purchase"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Always at my fingertips. No longer have 37 partially written journals floating around. Great for inconsistent journalists like me. 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"paying monthly for recording audio? no. don't like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes and keeping daily records/journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I been using it for 7 years already still like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It a nice journal. It comes in handy when I feel the need to write because I can access it anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Just for waste your money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great and very thoughtful app. I have been looking for one such application for long. It helps to express myself only to me with full security. Tested many other apps but this one has all the features that one need. Captures the location automatic, but you can also manually give your location, photos geotag captured automatically, add your mood, and many more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app 👍 Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good therapy for ya here"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, helps me deal with my other side."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Astonishing , it's an easy way to practice journaling, even for beginners........It has many features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a good app. One of only 2 apps I've ever stumped up money for. The only improvement I would make would be that I'd like to have 2 separate journals on the one account, one work one personal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I really only write my dreams in it but overall its an amazing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yes, i agree with the other reviews. This app is awsome it helps a lot to me especially in this time of pandemic, i can now easily trace back my activities Thanks to the developer. I love it so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seriously good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Very easy to use, very intuitive app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is helping me grow. Although I'm not very faithful about journaling, it helps me to keep my thoughts in one place for occasional review."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I will give minus rating coz my all data my dreams wasted by this app plz plz don't use this app. I feel biggest mistake of my life is this app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is wonderful portable journal. It was worth purchasing a full version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 4yrs and its amazing. Thankyou developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a new to this app. (About 30 days) It is very user friendly. I am using the free version. I would recommend this app for it's compatibility and various affordable upgrade options. I gave it a 5 🌟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful. It 's perfect for memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been on this app for over 4 years. It has met and exceeded my expectations. I am satisfied. Congrats to the devs and team for being responsive, high quality, regular updates, and new features. 👏👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"At least the app is pretty upfront about only being free for 7 days then bills monthly. There are way too many perfectly good apps available for free. WITHOUT having to get into my Google account. Uninstalling immediately!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app since 6 years now.Its the perfect app with all the great features one would want in a digital journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"horrible, useless, and terrible customer support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works like a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can take audio notes! I can save pictures! I can type from my computer! It's so cool!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really slick app with most features out of the box."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app!! Would recommend everyone to go premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing. I love this journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Feel betrayed with the high price subscription just before I use it. Not even a trial. I want to cancel and get a refund. Stop trapping people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice application, easy to use, and has enhanced the amount of gratitude, reflection, and self comfort I have in my life. Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good interactive app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app has too many pop-up ads for ""premium"" subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Getting better and better, Keep up the good work 👍👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why would I pay annually for a diary app 🤦🏾‍♀️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app from my point of view... All the functions are quite easy to handle and it's really organized!😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Though more expensive than I would prefer, this app does inspire me to write, so well done to the development team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app came out as 'better' of the few I tried. I thought of zinnia but besides expensive it's not available on android (mentioning zinnia for what I am looking forward/referring to). Would have rated 5 if they could better the feel/experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love Journey. I love writing there, editing the text, adding pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A powerful place to log my life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best app 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being aboe to use pictures and videos to keep a journal and remember this stagr of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for a long time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. Love it for capturing thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really, a paywall for the stuff?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Since last two years, I am using this and I love it but now after updating this app, whenever I am trying to save as pdf, this is not working. I have to uninstall it, if this problem stays."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved the app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app but I'm a little confused by it I've had it for some time and I never really took the time to use it as it's intended to it's full capabilities I'm trying though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App works well but bombards the user with several ads trying to get you to pay for premium every time you open it. Just have a limited free version and let the user decide for themselves rather then spam them constantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one. Can you also add a feature to add labels by hashtags? (This feature is there in Google keep)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, this app had everything I was looking for in a journal. I'm really enjoying capturing fleeting thoughts, morning affirmations, great ideas, talking through stresses. Being able to tag posts with words, moods, locations, activity, etc. is excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I suffer with anxiety but struggle to talk about it sometimes, so I put my thoughts into here and its like I can box things off. Its been absolutely brilliant for helping me with that, it helps bury my demons"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Keep it up 👍🏻🤘🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its ok."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better than Day one since it syncing and backups up for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful for keeping daily diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great product! Wish it had more font options though!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to be free now just another monthly gouge!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. It has given me the perfect place to add journal entries wherever I am and have them all sync together. And being able to add photos is very nice. One problem I have is the absurd amount of 50% off membership adds i get. Its an endless barrage and its a bit offputting. I would still highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent so far...nice and user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super helpful to keep your life focused."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The premium version is a bit overpriced in my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for Journalling during my daily prayer. It has handwriting ability so it is just like using a notebook. You can also upload your entries to your cloud space. The only thing it is missing is the ability to draw while journaling. I love to express my thoughts with drawings. I did find a secondary app where I can draw and add the drawing to the journal page but it would be great if it was all in one app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good in premium version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Some of my journal entries are missing! And it happens constantly. Any help?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is clean and has a bunch of nice features. Easily several apps worth of tools folded into one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has helped me so much with my journal. It's been perfect. So easy to use and seems to have so many gadgets but most of them with the membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has everything for me.im technologically Inadvanced! I get it and can work whats free.im enjoying this app.probably will end up subscribing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best. It is effecient for planning and memo taking. And the best is, it's free!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This more nice If bold and slant into settings permanently"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm still testing this app but I think it's really cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app. It takes some getting used to as I've written in an physical journal since I was 11yrs. I love that I can attach photos or documents to an entry. I'd like a daily prompt to be available not just when using a ""special or specific"" themed entry. I'd also like to set the time of day to receive the prompt. I would prefer this app to be a smaller fee and a one and done. When you buy a physical journal you don't pay a huge amount and you only pay once."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app it helps me to keep beautiful moments and organize my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the ability to freely share my experience here in my film."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is not at all what I thought it was. It should not fall under the daily planner category. Now I'm stuck with a subscription for a year that I probably won't use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"During the setup you're prompted to sign up for the trial. That's ok you can cancel any time but we all know they hope you forget. Then you are presented with a 50% offer on an app you've never used before. Buy now or miss out - that's a dark pattern. No thanks I'll try another app. Too many prompts to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool app! Would recommend to others for daily personal journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good app, All I needed was a cloud sync option for free user. And it gives it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Where is the subscribe option?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for the purpose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Giving 4 stars because the app constantly asks you to rate it. Otherwise the app is fine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using now for 2 yrs. Nearly every day I load a picture and say something. After 1 years I get the rewards of looking back ""on this day"". Really easy to use and reliable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't afford the subscription, I didn't realise s subscription fee needed to be paid. Very long winded access to actually make a diary of my photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's soo helpful. I use it for all daily/weekly my oracle readings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has everything I need–even just at the free level. It has pictures, mood tracking, basic writing, location tracking, and even movement tracking. It really has been the best app I've used so far for journaling. It's especially helpful in keeping track of the little things in a concise and accessible way (pics and moods) so that I can update my bullet journal once a week instead of daily. Thank you Journey!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Love that it sync's. Love that it's handy and easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fu*k*ng Perfect!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love the app but too expensive for extras"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. I have been looking for something like this. Love the cross-platform capabilities. I can sync it with my android and ipad! So now my diary thoughts are always with me. I can update whenever I feel the urge."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"UI is attractive, but from the moment I loaded it, it kept pushing the premium version. So annoying, I uninstalled it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Update: two years later and if anything, it's gotten worse. A request to subscribe when you start the app. A request to subscribe when you finish writing. I'm writing a sentence or two a few times per day. Annoying. **** The app itself works just fine for what I need it for, but the constant requests to upgrade are really annoying. It's common to get two full-screen requests to upgrade in a single 2 minute session. I'm actually considering switching to a different app for that reason alone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal. Simple & easy to use and allows you to attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I so enjoy having this available from either my phone or tablet which makes it easier to write something. Even though I don't write every day, I still write more than I did without the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It really does help. There are plenty of things to use that are free. I am more organized and I feel great. Thank you. I have found that I can sort everything in my head once I have wrote it down. You can even add photos and stuff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is good to write your diary. All features you need are here. Backup won't let your data to be lost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I purchased premium lifetime. No options to restore data from Google drive"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used a Hobonichi Techo for years but decided to see what digital items are out there. Journey has immediately and completely replaced my Hobonichi. It's exactly what I was looking for. There are so many nice, thoughtful touches. Like if you add a photo to a journal entry it then asks you if you want to set the journal entry time to the time the picture was taken. That's great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Liked it soo much 👍😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So smooth; with quick entries and reminders. Helps me put my daily experience down in an efficient way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Signed up for premium free trial, used it a couple times but it didn't fit my needs. Forgot to unsubscribe, so when I received a notification from my bank about the charge, I immediately reached out and asked for a refund. I haven't heard back from any of the emails asking about an update on the refund status. I stopped using the app days before the charge, so I don't know why my refund was denied. Went through Google Pay and had my refund approved in 10 minutes. Not using this app anymore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good, writing down about my frustrating day, or the good Happy days, and someday some things I don't share with anyone, it's my digital personal diary. It's good, I can add pics too, which is why I like it even more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems like a good and well thought out app. I would like to use, but with the way I journal I need separate journals as well as tags. If Journey were to add the option for multiple journals, I would happily switch from Day One"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Has great features but stays too the point."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great great experience with app, the app has been a good experience, definitely worth investing in ...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Great Diarys"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"(2017)At last, I am able to journal online and keep track of my thoughts and reflections across my 3 devices rather than filling notebooks with illegible scrawl that I am unable to decipher. Update Aug 2020 I re installed this on my tablet after a factory reset and i am unable to access my previous entries or create new ones. I ca see them in the 'headlines' but the page is blank when i open it. It's very frustrating!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that helps me out with every day life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Diary/journal/notebook etc on your phone to save and look at later and go back and edit etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app to know about yourself Which recreates your awesome memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👌🏾"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and lovable ui"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"10 out of 5. Would get addicted again. This app's a sin. I mean drug."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Once I learned what Journey had to offer me, I was on board. I am a journalist and was looking for an easy convenient way to document our travels. Let's me post pictures from my gallery into my Journey Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! I love that you can add pictures ad video."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for more than 3 months and I have consistently written in it everyday. My perception of the app may be skewed as a paid user due to having a higher expectations. Firstly, formatting your writing is a nightmare. The bullet points often gets bugged, messing up my entire workbook. I reviewed my review and I have to give it one star. Upon syncing my windows and phone app, I lost my journal entry which I have poured my heart into. I am enormously disappointed and frustrated"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, easy to access, elegant."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has helped me get thru this pandemic thru writing and reflecting on my thoughts and sefting up imaginative worlds so I just wanted to say thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for years now. It's reliable, simple, complete, and a delight to use. The premium has been worth every cent over the years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has such a user friendly interface and has so many options of journaling ideas!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy from either my phone or my notebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app since 2016 (with break intervals). I loved it then and I love this equaly now as well. I faced an issue today while making entry. I was writing at midnight and when the day changed (00:00) , the screen got blank and app crashed automatically. Also the writing draft was not saved. Please look into this issue at your convinience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi, I've been using this app for a while now, but for some reason the font changed to Roboto, and I can't get my normal font anymore. None of the available fonts is the font I had before. Did anything happen? Is it with my gboard?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've subscribed for a year and the benefit has been awesome. Email entry takes all pressure off in trying to find time to make and entry, even at work. Highly recommend Journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and I like that it reminds you to update every so often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Solid App. Easy to use and keep track of."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Combined with Google audio to text this is the best diary I have ever had."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is good but the app is asking me to pay monthly when I am installing it on windows. While I have already paid lifetime membership it is a bit annoying. I am unable to sync it over my desktop and hence, it is a bit uncomfortable for me to use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty happy with this app. Wish they'd remove the location button that they stopped supporting in 2019."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful way to memorialize our trips and activities. Highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Full function journal app with all the bells and whistles in the paid for version. Introduction of new features has added value to an already comprehensive journaling tool 👍🏽"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App is just ok, doesn't fit my needs - web version lacks features, completely useless for me. I uninstalled it, disabled Google account access -- it still sends me emails and I can't unsubscribe it because it requires to sign in to do that. So it just harvests emails from user registration, and won't let it go when user disconnects it from Google account management. Very bad practice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good application. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and has lots of functions to take advantage of. I wish it integrated with more software like Garmin Connect to pull in all your statistics from there so you could have a graph to see how your activity and weight affects your mood."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"One of the best app for journal writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app. I ended up paying for a one year subscription. Only suggestion to make it a 5 star app would be to make it less expensive or free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's horrible that you're getting charged to use a journal!I'm sorry I don't care if it's an upgrade or what! If it's a journal or diary application. only to find out that when you download it it's only a 7-Day free trial! SCAM, FALSE ADVERTISING, RIPOFF. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT TO ONE STAR IS BECAUSE I COULD NOT SELECT NONE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I was planning to buy premium membership, but I can see that there is no one tap activities entry features.ehich is very easy to use ... So sad.. we have to write manually only.. .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it keeping the Bible at my finger tips and a great many devotionals daily of all sorts and especially having the verse of the day it's awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that you can add audio, video and pics."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Iz good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive journal that incorporates your photos, locations, and will remind you to notate your day or even set different programs up for you they have already created. Overall easy to use and very nice to look back on my moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Paid for the app yet still gets constant ads on sales. The edit view is also riddled with little bugs. Right now the most frustrating one is the keyboard is hidden everytime after going to a new line."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great BUT Can you guys make the recent screen dark like the incognito tab on the Google chrome so no one can see what was the screenshot of the last thing u were doing on the app. When I go on the recent tab from ur phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If I were to spill my guts, this is an awesome place to do it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Quite a good app, the additional freebies with self love tasks, mindfulness practices, blogs are great. Just wish i could add my name so its personalised and doesn't just say 'Hi'. It feels distant. Is that too much to ask from the free version?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Doing great with it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nice app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this app for a few years now and I couldn't say better things about it. Love the backup feature so it's not a hassle when switching phones. Great app! Edit: 2 years later and my feelings are still the same 😌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Aplikasi yang bagus untuk ngelatih nulis, mulai dari nulis event harian aja."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The problem is I don't find a way to keep my diary pages too private. I mean sure that passcode is great but as soon as the app opens up anyone can see what I have written and attached without opening the contents. U should add in settings an option to preview attachments or not ,the content or not. I hope u got what I was talking about.... 😶"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only annoying part is that almost every time you open the app, you will get a pop-up to pay for membership to unlock more features. I get that they want us to subscribe but shoving the same pop-up each time isn't going to miraculously change my mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app keep it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app for being able to capture a special moment and writing about it. I want to save these to share with my grandkids as they grow up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. One question, what are Android-only advance features, under membership section?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal set up across multiple platforms. Syncs well and is always a click away."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean, intuitive ui The best journal app I've used, period"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well. Seamless integration in Android and windows."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it a lot. Easy to use for personal and business. I use it for my plant journal too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for personal dairy. And the sync option across all devices is the best option ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. Tried canceling annual subscription without success and now not willing to refund me. Think twice before registering."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps me accountable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for abt 4 yrs and I still love it !^^"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app and have continued using it. So I have no complaints. I love that it interface is simple and not cluttery. Way to go!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app, I can look back at photos, how far I've come in my getting fit journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, has all the basic features necessary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Free version works well for what I need it for, but god damn ! They bombard you with adds to buy the full version and it gets pretty annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I use it to capture memorable kid moments like first words etc like that I can arch photos and videos. Highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for capturing whatever I'm thinking while I'm thinking it and keeping the whole experience (pictures, videos) in one place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and the price is right"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have the Lifetime membership. Why I'm I still getting ads about subscriptions?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app..good place to vent, tell secrets to..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please add templates in mobile app ("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsome app i would recomend a coach"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app itself is friendly and useful. Wished some features would be free though or at least without membership. Web bases journey shouldnt be so hard to use when you want to get bullets, sizes and stuff. And the daily quotes repeats itself over and over and over again....so purchase motivation from like the 5 same quotes..that's sad with a world of great lines outthere"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing! I really appreciate this app. I usually don't write my reviews unless the app i use is exceptional and this app is exceptional. If you want to maintain journal to write something or anything like that this app is for you, trust me you won't be disappointed at all. I have changed like 3 phones but i never lost any data (obviously i back up) unlike some other apps i have used in past which even after backing up lost my data. Love this application.🤍🤍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I LOVE THIS APP!! I just wish that after paying for the yearly subscription, all of the editing options that appear online is also available via the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to record my daily events. The app is amazing but take care when changing phones..I lost a year !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I subscribed to Journey in June 2019 and really liked the app. My subscription renewed after going into lockdown. I lost my job and immediately cancelled my subscription and wrote to the Journey app developer and requested a refund since we are struggling immensely for even food money. I had not used the app most of last year, as well as, this year. Their response is that they cancelled my subscription, but no refund would be issued. They have every right to not refund me, but I really thought they would be a little more understanding."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome & easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the way it operates, and I'm particularly happy that works both on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ phone as well as my brand new iOS latest generation iPad. Thank goodness for cross-platform apps. I am adding this to my review after using it for a few months. I love this app, however in a recent update it is doing something that I very much don't like. When I go to edit an entry or correct a mistake; right after I place the cursor it has this new feature where it repositions the page. Hate !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like the reminders and the tips and tricks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's what I'm looking for in a good journal. I love the option of writing things to myself and scheduling for a future date"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A brilliant app. Love all the little add-ons such as time of day, temperature and being able to add photos etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app changes my life. I keep writing my own story. Very nice experience! Thanks to journey 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it very easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So great to have an easy way to keep memories and journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great. It has been very helpful and useful with regard to my mental wellbeing and health. Otherwise good for documenting events. For what you get the full edition is well worth the money as it is only a one time payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly interface that provides an outlet for the active wandering mind. One feature I would perhaps like to see refined is a Search/Scan function within specific entries. Thanks for the solid app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Without paying there's nothing much here. Sad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is amazing I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Easy to use. Does the job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"works great on my phone but wont let me upload pictures wheni use the app version on my new computer.....i have an annual membership and the template is not showing up either like it does on my phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"JUST LOVE IT"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I'm not even using this to its full potential as its still the free version. I said that I would try journalling as a way to get my feelings out. This way is so convenient because it literally is in the palm of my hands."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cannot deactivate my account. Dark mode is premium only and windows app requires paid membership to be used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Let the reminders to journal!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I downloaded it there the now and noticed I have to pay for it after a month, so I unstalled it, do I have to pay even though I unstalled it and don't use it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Splendid. I'm hoping for the far future to see myself today"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was searching for a journal app. Then I come across JOURNEY. At first sight I told myself this is it. This is what I was searching for. Journey is beautifully designed. One of the best UI/UX. I respect and appreciate the hard work and dedication put to this incredible app. In order to honour their hours of hard work I decided to upgrade to lifetime membership. And I think it's worth it. I'm happy and want to thank whole journey team for creating this app. Keep improving."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good app. Haven't found a reason to upgrade to Premium...which is actually a good thing..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bummer! They want you to buy a year subscription, BEFORE you ""try"" it out! They should tell you this upfront before you download it and waste all that time, just to find out we've been taken by a bait and switch scam. It might be a good app but now I'll never find out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A good app, and I like that it supposedly backs everything up. Geo-tagging is nice too to keep track of travels. Only downside is I continue to get upsell offers when I have already purchased the lifetime premium offer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app nothing else like it on the market. Well worth paying for thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app! I use it everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's amazing it helps me through a lot of hard times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really enjoying this app, however the coach sessions dont seem to update daily and I'm finding I have to try and download them again and again. Other than that it's working well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanxx guy's!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just have the non upgraded version and have been completely satisfied with this app. Gices me a great opprtunity to review my day and the suggestions from the coaches on what to write give me insight into myself and something I can refer back to..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years. I can't imagine anything better on the market. I recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, really enjoying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everyday use. AWESOME!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sad to see how they impose new age dictrine in thus app. For reason lone im deleting the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping a journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quiet useful to record daily experiences and tag important events for easy recall. Ability to add photos helps to enhance the value of historical data"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a while , the free version. The issue I'm having is I've got a new phone and I'm wondering how to transfer all of my original Journey files from my old phone to my new phone. Or maybe even transfer all files from the old phone to a computer to save pictures and pertinent information."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps me keep up with daily activities, & my baby growing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity and the functions of the app, both mobile and desktop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I got the life subscription on sale so I'd wait for that to come around. Great deal. No complaints here you can attach any files and it all copies to Google drive. There's a separate password for the app which Im sure is nice for some. It also had a quaint memories function where it tells you what you were doing 1 year ago which I like also. The feed is easy to navigate and you can use tags too. Pretty awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app! Having the ability to journal on the go is wonderful 💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it daily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the formatting and layout of this app. I like having the pictures of each entry displayed like a banner at the top. I think a wider range of moods would be nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely fantastic experience app to capture the most incredible moments of life. When I look back at my entries, they are such beautiful memories. Although the standard app is fantastic, I haven't explored the premium version - it's a bit too pricey in my view AUD 50 per year. I think I wouldn't have mind a one-off fee or a bit more reasonable annual fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this for comedy when a good joke comes to mind I put it into the journal and it's right there where I need it. I couldn't think of any improvements as a fantastic app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, I've used daily for yrs in various countries without a glitch."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty good. Stable. But I wish I could attach photos directly into the post as opposed to just doing it on the side."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app is OK. But they are extremely pushy to make you pay a subscription. It's an simple journey app, not worth what they want you to pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, have a great time writing diary here"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using apps like Evernote and Google Keep, but Journey is the app that got me to start journaling consistently. I feel that while other apps are perfect for note taking, Journey is perfect for journaling. The interface is elegant and the features available are just right. I appreciate the thought behind this app! 🙏🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been trying to find a good diary app. This fits the bill. I like the picture function for keeping track."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping memories from holidays, been using for a few years now. Nice to look back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using journey for a few years, its perfect! Great security, can export entries, easy to use, add photo's, look back. Have used it on 3 Android phones & sync's to desktop with ease. Highly recommend as a journal to clear your thoughts & express your inner self. Premium membership is well worth it and great value. Thanks for making a great app 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying so far. Started with Day One, but the PC ""version"" is a joke. This seems to be working better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years!!! Brought pro a long time ago too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app for self work or healing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very Bad. I paid for some lifetime subscription to be able to use some basic features, I neither got the feature nor any history of my orders. They will keep clogging the timeline with ads for more payment. Worst and most unfriendly app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app and fulfill all requirements. Never felt that I m writing on some virtual diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Syncing from Android and opening in Chrome app, many html tags all over the place. Thanks for the suggestion but I see there's a pricing difference involved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well best diary app I can find on app store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only reaaon it gets 4 stars out of 5 is because ypu cant change the theme for free. Edit: i would upgrade if i could but i dont have any money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cool app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Valuable self-examination and improvement tool. Good features, easy to use, and worth the cost of Premium access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a really great app. I am glad a downloaded it. Since i used to right in my journal bye hand, this makes my life so much easier. I really recommend this app. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app to journal for years. Fantastic!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just start using this app , it's kinda user friendly app , great for a first timer journal writing.but please consider on being able to rotate or using it in landscape mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish there were more features for the free option, but it's still good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journaling app. I enjoy it alot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have used this on and off for several years and what's really impressed me is how easy it is to start back up and, with data being on my Google Drive, I've never lost an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Using this app long ago with my old phone, and came here again since i need journal app in my new phone. Would be really appreciated if i can publish to Instagram feed as well (not only reshare photos, but also the caption)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's irritating while opening the app and get offer option to accept or dismiss - Can it be ""Never ask again"" ? 80% of features are locked/need to buy subscription. Within 20%, you can just write the things. That's it ! I don't see any sparkling things in free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice app. Its actually better than social media. And your not constantly seeking validation from others, can recommend 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi there, really like using the app, very convenient. I wanted to ask if there's a landscape mode setting that I have to turn on? I can'y seem to find that setting or is that a feature that's not present yet? - Onelplus 7t, if its not a feature could we get it? I use a external keyboard and it would be really helpful if i could get a landscape display while typing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"ideal ! (mostly)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The ui looks fabulous and I really love using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Like others on here I got fooled into paying for a 12 month subscription thinking it would be a free 7 day trial before actually paying. I immediately asked for a refund and a Jeremy said he would make an acception for me. After a couple of weeks and no refund I emailed Jeremy who refused to provide the refund with a multitude of excuses - he claimed it was my responsibility to terminate the subscription and he also claimed that I did trial it. All very confusing and disappointing when I only wanted to try it out. Turns out that it only allows for one Journal so not suitable for my needs anyway. Not good service from their accounts team. Don't trust them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple. Elegant. Functional. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Good UI and has adequate features in the free version too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Honestly, it keeps advertising for premium version that its annoying. Moreover there are many alternatives that offer similar functionalities but lesser price. Umimpressed. Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I've been using for a little bit and I like ut"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is the app that always travels with you and knows Ur deep thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I just wish the one time purchase gave me everything"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app a couple years ago, but with constant updates, has become completely unusable (my phone isn't high end but also isn't super old). Can even open entries anymore. That, along with the very steep price of membership (used to be a few dollars for a premium account), sketchy privacy rules, and a now clunky, laggy interface, means I'm ditching this app for good, after nearly 1500 entries. Another app ruined by corporate greed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would like to be able to edit fonts and colors easily, and more colors please 🙂 but ty for your app I have been using it over 7 years now and my content is...priceless to me 💛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been trying to journal in order to help with my mental health, using sketchbooks as journals. I hated using them because I never remembered to write in them and felt bad for wasting paper. This app has been a lifesaver! I can set a reminder to journal for each day, I'll always have it with me, and the Atlas section allows me to see where I have been for all of my memories! I truly do love this app! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, I'm not thrilled about the subscription model. The app used to be a one-time purchase for premium. I will give it five stars if they bring back a one-time purchase option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm glad I got this app when nobody else had it and it was about five bucks. 4 years ago when I did the first review, I thought it was wonderful . I still think it's a wonderful app ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Features of the app functionality can be limited to premium members. I get that. But why dark mode is only for premium users!! Randomly stumble upon this app. Seems good. It offers enough free features to get used to the habit of journaling. Once we become adapted to this habit we can buy premium membership (monthly subscription/one time purchase) to unlock advance things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A convenient diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Is there any plans to get it to allow handwritten entries on devices with s pen? (note and tab series)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have only been using this app for a week now, so far it has been great. It has really helped me keep up with my daily journaling. Thanks for the great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A nice way to keep track of your day how you felt and what went on"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app encourages me to update my journal everyday by syncing between all platforms I use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app and how it works across devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great I love adding pictures to my Journaling. It's great worth the price. Thanks for creating this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for its ease, so fun to see where I was, the temp, and then to record my blessings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Y, THANK UOU FOR THIS APP I ENJOY MY TIME JOUNALING THAT THANKS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I dread opening this app because of the constant disruptive 50% off premium adverts. I even get popup windows on my screen saying 'Long time no see...' telling me to start a new entry, which I don't want and can't turn off. You've finally lost me. As soon as I get a chance I'll be migrating to another app. After all this hassle there's no way you're having my money 😅"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am at over 1300 days of writing in my journal every day and I love that it syncs to the Internet. Would like an option to copy multiple days worth of entries into a Microsoft Word Document or Google Doc so I can more easily share my entries. One small request, could you please add an ""undo"" feature? Too many times I have typed up a long journal entry, then I accidentally double tap the screen, causing the entire entry to be highlighted, then I type a letter and it deletes it all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing App 💯 Can add pics, notes, special fonts & more 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 GREAT features‼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years now. Premium features & one time purchase for premium Journey, that is generous. Thank you. I have very little friends and I couldnt talk to my friends. Journey has helped me in a lot of ways. (1) I can talk to my diary anytime when i feel unhappy. Thats the main reason I get Journey. (2) I can use the coach to write something about my life. I really like this feature! (3) I can use it on my phone and laptop. Sometimes, I just want to lie on the bed n write"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Kaboom"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The only reason I'm not giving five stars has to do with the excessive amount of ads, blurbs and all sorts of colorful banners that constantly annoy and nag me to upgrade to the subscription plan. Many of those steal space that should be occupied by the app and distract me when all I'm trying to do is organize my thoughts and write about my day. Many of those ads require you to manually close them and you sometimes get multiple of them at once after opening the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Pay App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. I would like to suggest the developer to add more than one video per journal entry. Other than that, I am satisfied with the app. Edit: Still good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very great. I am a busy body and my sitting has to be perfect. Even in my journal. This makes it easier to talk about everything and let my phone pick up what I'm saying. Sounds so lazzy and it is. But great app for anyone who uses a journal daily or whenever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I loved this app. I paid the one-time $7.99 to support the developer even though I didn't need the additional features. I hoped this would end the ads. Instead I continue to get constant, incessant countdowns and reminders to BUY MORE START TODAY REDEEM NOW. Im currently blocked by 2 of these windows. The little cartoon icons of meditating women (""Spark joy! Declutter your mind!"") are tone-deaf to the red, ticking 15-minute countdowns for discount codes to become a monthly member. Not interested"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journaling! Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's not free. $37 charge to your Google Play account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Syncs across apps. Good journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is good at what it does and the aesthetic is what got me over other apps, specially the dark mode, it has lots of options to record things through the days besides just written entries. I just hope that it gets a better way to overview in a calendar all the entries, and to be able to customize what I want to appear on the home screen, but otherwise it's pretty good. *This is using a paid lifetime membership, which I must say, having a monthly one makes one feel left out in some aspects"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Can add times and multiple entries per day, add photos, weather, feeling, geotag, etc. Very, very happy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome new platform to write whatever I'm thinking very safe locked if you want which was important ntonme as these are my true feelings which I tend to analyze in the future to help with the daily problem of the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Even the free version is a good simple platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. The prompts are nice to have when you don't know what to say on a given day. Also the password is a nice touch."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am a premium member and here are my few suggestions. 1. Allow option to add multiple photos and other media file. 2. Include handwriting support, to journal using stylus or pen. 3. Introduce a seperate version for tablet. 4. Ruled lines paper to write upon. 5. Introduce windows 10 app version with enhanced features. So that we can edit, modify on pc Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is really amazing, it has so many features and it helps me write every day. If you get the membership you can also connect your desktop and mobile so you can write or see from every where and attach many pictures and videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"..I just hope that the 'night mode' option is free. I think it's too much that you'll need to pay to get a night mode set up while other apps offer it for free. This will be my new journal and my daily use, since it's way better than the old app I used. Keep it up and I do enjoy this app! UPDATE: ADS about going PREMIUM on the app is terribly ANNOYING!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. But premium is too much expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really am enjoying how easy it is to journal with this app and It is helpful that I can include photos, tags and print entries as well!! So many added features with the membership that made it even better. Road to bliss!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best invrstnent that i ever made."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Customer service is horrible. I was trying to get my account refunded as first sign in was confusing instead of a 7day trial i was prepared for, i was immediately charged the full amount for the first month. After writing in through the feedback system in app, An email came to say they would process and refund in 2 working days. Now, 2 months and multiple emails later still no reply from the team nor online feedback team and no refund in sight either."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not Up Front ----> Learn from this... ---- If you are going to ask for money for your app via subscription, then be upfront with people when you put that product out. There is nothing more disappointing than find a (tiny) subscription message at the bottom of the app after you open it. I noted it was in the smallest possible type, something that credit cards use. There is something unsettling about that practice. Change that..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My go to getaway place. Love🥰 it…"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the simplist, cleanest, and most user-friendly journal and diary app on the market"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Slick app, but it constantly spams me asking me to pay for a subscription. The nag screen is in my face every single time I open the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Got it in July 2016 and it's still good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works fairly well for keeping journals. I use Google voice dictation and it's fairly quick to jot down the day's happenings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best app. I am using it for long time. •It's weather is much much much much better and accurate than any outher weather app. I tried many times and it's always accurate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's equally intuitive and feature full which I enjoy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. I'm glad that you guys haven't changed it too much to where people would start disliking it. You've kept it pretty original I'd say"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A well thought through app. Makes it very easy to keep up a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It won't stop offering me ‘limited’ promotions and asking me to upgrade literally every time I open the app. Edit: I decided to try a different app and lo and behold the export feature is behind a paywall. You do not even offer the basic courtesy of allowing users to take their data with them if they want to leave. Not good enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome jus awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is absolutely worthless with no value. The subscription was a complete waste of money. Avoid"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's cool whenever I want to scream out my emotions I use this lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a wonderful app and great utility. I initially used it few years back, but later stopped using for some reason. But, came back to it now. I had the paid app back then, but I didn't know what much to do of it. Now, started using it again and realising its full potential now. How wonderful things just come back to you. Its a game changer of an app. Loving using it & its features. Thank you for such wonderful app. One of the best apps I am using now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and gentle reminders to keep up the Journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The Journey concept is fine, but the android app is not perfect, it has. some bugs and it doesn't feel as modern as other apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep your thoughts etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super good app with web support now pls STAHP POPPING UP SHII WHEN I WANA WRITE!!!😡🤪👏😭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and helpful to just jot your thoughts down on the go"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this this app. Every night it will just let me gather all my happiness at one place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Has the ability to select photos from Google Photos been fixed. I will not update unless this has been done. After the last update, selection of media from Google Photos went away again. I am selecting from the file menu, not Gallery. I restored the previous version where the ability to select from Google Photos still exists. No more updates until this is fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Paid for a month to test it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"07312020\TWIMC:/.\I am taking the journey alone. This notetaking blogspace seems to be private enough for anyone who is still practicing the gentle art of communication. Well worth the price. Thanks to Google Play, and thanks to Journey./.\ CJM/.\"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only free for 7 days"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling! Easy to use and secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that you can back up your journal in the cloud, what a lifesaver! Only thing I don't like is that even after purchasing a lifetime membership, it keeps bothering me with ads to upgrade. Other than that, I love it, and I've recommended it to several friends!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Does what it is supposed to do. Not loaded with ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my favourite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great app overall but the ad to keep pushing you to buy it is really really annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"They say journaling daily is very important to having a healthy mindset and to help figure out problematic life events and so much more and before I found this app doing that was so hard! Not anymore with Journey I've managed to stay on top of writing about my day daily and it has insightful graphs to help you track your mood, writing habits and so much more. I honestly love this app and would recommend it to anyone who struggles with staying on top of writing their thoughts down daily. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still a great app. I stopped using the app a couple of years ago but I'm back yall, LOL 😆. I don't know why I ever stopped using it. It's a great and wonderful way for me to journal on a memorable moment - no matter where I am at. Especially for memory keeping, it's the best in my book."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My daily happiness journal best way to express my feelings my emotions my achievement my failures my best friend..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very poor service. I purchased lifetime premium but it's not letting me use features. It keeps prompting me to the purchase page, where it indicates I already have Lifetime Premium. I wrote to the help desk and received a message to write back during working hours Mon-Fri between 9AM-5PM. It is now Monday at 12:30. These ARE their working hours."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Although there are constant ads and pop ups to pufchase the whole app I can push it aside since its basically a nice simple app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Putting dark mode behind a paywall was a great way to get me to immediately uninstall the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decent 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The password somehow has changed and I can't get into the app, lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm very happy that I have Journal in my life, it has definitely helped me to vent, process my thoughts and emotions, and look back on old memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I absolutely love this app and it has everything I need, but it's killing my storage. I'm at 8GB so far. Is there a way around this?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had a great experience using this app very well done with good options for backup of entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite because it is fun, looks nice yeah"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. I have been using it since 2018"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Always in my phone wherever I am so whenever I have a few extra minutes I can add to my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journaling app I've used. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing, ease of use , practical, free, everything i could ever want in a journal. The best one yet, and believe me I have tried alot !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one great little app. Very handy, ve ry useful. Is password protected, which is a great great feature. It's not a 10 app, but it's a solid 9!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Minimal interface, sleek design, and user friendly. Journey is to the point and just the app you need when you want to write or analyze your entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It looks really nice as a digital diary. However, it doesn't save entries properly in my device. Like when I stop and ""exit"" an entry, it just saves 80% of what I've written. And I find that dissatisfying because that's apparently one of its core functions (as it's a digital diary). I hope this can be fixed though as it really seems like it's a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying the free version of this journal app. Simple and convenient. I just type out whatever is on my mind!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the app. Just started using it, hence only the 4 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it and I'm glad I paid for it, you won't hear me say that often about and app. It's user friendly and some excellent features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Honestly, the best journal app I've used EVER. It's minimalistic and yet functionally sound."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The video recording does most of the job for me..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use! But lots of annoying ads in the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very usable app. Very intuitive design."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good journal app. Ive enjoyed it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the interface. Easy to use. Hope we could put more photos/videos though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my dream journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I think its a rip off"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If only the purchase were cross platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There are a couple of minor issues technically, doesn't close properly under certain circumstances, but works well for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used the app for over a year now and I love it! The interface is simple and user friendly. It's clean and consistent. I love being able to publish, download, add photos and geolocations. I love you can share a post or keep everything private. You do have to pay for extra features, but it's well worth the small cost to maintain my memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a fine app. Does what it needs to. I would love a one time purchase for premium features w) the ability for more customization"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice. I love it and I pay for the premium. Hoping that the Dev could make it easier to upload pics using gallery efficiency. It hard to upload pics when the software just showing the recent pics."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This Diary is easy to use, I have used many but this is just unique"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good journal, constant advertisement. If you can deal with the ads that come with every 2nd click to upgrade to a premium membership, then it's a pretty good journal. It does get to you though - as sometimes your state of mind is in such a way that makes these ads almost unbearable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, on the go entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. I've been using for a year along with my wife. Great thing to leave little notes to let each other know you care ♡♡♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the throwbacks!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It works for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cannot tell, can I use this app for free basically? I'm not talking about 7 days. I'm not paying for a phone app that is basically a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy app....very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for ages and this is the best I've seen. I love journey and hope to use it's services forever. <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The App is easy to use and I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has helped me a lot in handling my anxiety. It is my outlet for thoughts that I cannot voice with the people I live with, lest they are scared for me or worry. Journey has become the best friend who's always there for me, and listens patiently without judging. A fantastic journaling app, I recommend this highly to anyone who's starting out with journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Essential App. The absolute top pick of Journal apps that has served reliabily now for years. Very nicely formatted text entry, load images etc. Lovely and reliable reminders of the day from past months and as you lean on it years. Brilliant to be able to enter stuff by 'share' from wide range of apps (Pocket/ Kindle you name it). Solid Chrome extensions. Great to be based inside Google drive. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, trying to use it daily, but am now finding more things to add and be able to have challenges in one place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journalling app. Particularly love the syncing with Google Drive. Would be 5 stars if you could set a default activity setting. Having to change each entry is a pain, particularly if you forget. Edit: 26/7/2020: 5 stars now. Easily my go to, and come back to, journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have decided to return to a 5-star rating. It's that good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the fact that I can jot my thoughts down at any time on my phone whenever I want as long as my phone is near."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Terbaik apps nih"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hello, I've upgraded and the bennies look very nice! Please tell me how to sync to pc without paying $20 to download. If love to put Journey on all my devices. In addition, thank you so much for your quick response. I believe that once I understand how to add Journey to my laptop, I'll be able to come in and upgrade my review. I do appreciate the hard work your team put in to create this outstanding app. This app does rock! I'm in here every few hours adding pics and info. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I find this app very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This apk is superb! I had locked my Google drive apk and hidden it from my device so that no one got excess to my cloud data even I left my phone anywhere. But doing so, this apk was unable to sign-in in Google drive I and finally fixed this issue after 4hrs of constant trying. If anyone is facing issue with sign-in with Google drive sign in that's because they have locked it. So please make sure to unencrypt Google drive for sign-in. There's no problem with this apk😅"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journl, been using it for years now :) I have it on my phone, PC and chromebook and it's served many different purposes. From keeping recipies to writing for daily prompts to just jotting notes. I especially love the reminder you can set, frequency and time of day. And being able to attach pics straight from your phone? Priceless. You can even get it to prompt you whenever you take a new pic, asking if you want to write about it. I have a lifetime subscription for a reason :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super bomb. Really try it out. It works awesome with Google photos- you attach a picture from your backed up photo gallery and add whatever other memory you have. I just really hope this app lasts... My whole life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app,very reliable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tricks me into payed subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app does exactly what is expected and has useful reminders or throwbacks to previous posts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish they had more option in editing for free but well guess they need profit too so yeah, but I like the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying the app. The lifetime membership is a good deal compared to many apps which only offer monthly subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great across multiple devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it. It is one of those apps that I actually have started using every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just as way of an update I couldnt be happier .This is an excellent journaling app and I've tried a lot. It has a clean, crisp and intuitive interface. Display on all devices is day followed under by time so it is also a moment by moment diary. Journey is a cross platform app. It syncs perfectly. It allows you to track your moods. It provides you with historical statistics giving a great overview of what works for you and doesn't. Flexible and great pricing. Better than Day One."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Quick question... I actually thought I paid for the lifetime subscription as it was reflected on the app under my profile. As I Paid $39.99. only to see in the receipt that it's just a yearly member after I reinstall the app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. And i like the reminders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is simple yet effective and gets work done on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a personal recorder"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I should not pay for the huge subscription amount just because it's editor's choice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great one stop app. Haven't even paid for the extra features yet, but will before I journey proper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, very responsive both on desktop and mobile"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for keeping a daily journal or just to keep your ideas in one convenient place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this App since 2016 and I have never had a any reason to download it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Accurate and private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I ran into a few technical difficulties and literally blew up at the technical support lady, but she took it like champ (I Apologized profusely, she didn't deserve it) and was an amazing help. I absolutely love the app besides a few minor glitches but it's to be expected. Nothing is perfect. It's the best your there on the market and I love the fact it gives me options to record voice, write or record video. That's the best part. It all depends on my mood that day. Im a lifer!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I want to love this app but I spent 15min trying to find where to record my voice for an entry and cannot find it? Is there a voice record option for each entry?? Not an upload audio from my files."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My go to Journal !! Im really enjoying this app. I wish more things were free like font change and bold type. other than that a good start for basic journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's worth the money because the app just works. It's easy to use and nice to look at. The markdown ability is nice as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"does the thing love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only journaling system that has ever worked for me. Its convenient, quick and sustainable. It's been a game changer for my mental health and organization."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Avoid! Avoid! Avoid this app! It's definitely not free. They took £28 from me for this app that's supposed to be free! I've tried and tried again to obtain a refund, but the the app developer has stopped responding to me emails! Definitely do not recommend app! To top it, I did what the reply suggested and emailed again, was then told to contact the credit team, which I did and still yet again, NO REPLY! Disappointed that apps like this get away with hidden costs like this, disgusting!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Okay but they except you 2 pay 4 subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journalling, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool. I finally started making notes properly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app, but can you have a feature to pin important notes to the top?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good for me, never let me down in anyway."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I love this journaling app. It does a great job of balancing free writing and prompts and doesn't overwhelm me with data or suggestions or ads or anything. Very intuitive interface. UPDATE July, 2020: I wrote the above in January. I downloaded this app on January 2 and signed up for a 7-day Free Trial of the Premium subscription. After signing up, the app offered me a discounted rate if I signed up for a year's subscription right then. I was enjoying the app after a day or two and decided to spend the $29.99 plus tax to get the full year subscription, which was billed to me on January 2. On January 8, my debit card was charged for the full price of a year's subscription ($49.99 plus tax) because my free trial had ended. When I looked at my Google Play Order records, I had two subscriptions for the term of January, 2020 with renewal January, 2021. I contacted Google Play who referred me to the developer for a refund. Two App customer support responded to my email request and provided me a webform to request a refund. That form, as far as I can tell, was sent to their Billing Department. I received a few emails both from the Customer Service Rep (who took zero responsibility for Two App having double-billed my Google Play account for the same subscription term) and from a gentleman from the billing department, who promised me a refund around the end of January. He did not at any point respond to my request for a timeline once he agreed to issue the refund. Six months later, I have not received my refund. I followed up via email with both of the people I had heard from before. I was asked to complete the same webform I had submitted back in January which the CSR promised would be addressed by the billing department. I have followed up weekly since I re-submitted the webform Refund Request and no refund has been issued to either my Google Play account or my debit card. I cannot get any further information out of Two App after many attempts and, at this point, I cannot allow anyone else to be duped by Two App and their fraudulent billing practices. Why would any reasonable person believe that after paying for a full year's subscription to an app, that they would then have to cancel the free trial of the same subscription? Why would any Google Account need or want two subscriptions to the same app for the same exact duration? AVOID the PREMIUM UPGRADE and AVOID the Free Trial Reputable businesses understand that their employees will sometimes make mistakes and it happens. But to avoid the suspicion of malfeasance or fraud, I would expect that they would promptly acknowledge the error and issue a refund of the second, full-price charge. But it's over six months now and I am still awaiting my money. I have asked that they review their billing protocols and programming to automatically roll any existing free trials into any annual membership purchased by the same Google Account. And they have continued to remain silent. Multiple emails and half of a year later, I have no recourse left available to me but to let the world know that Two Apps is fraudulently billing people for two, simultaneous subscriptions. They have offered no solutions and no assistance in literally any capacity. I would uninstall on principle, but I'm paid through the end of 2020 (twice over, in fact) so I might as well get some use out of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always my number one choice!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm just beginning to use this app, but I'm very pleased so far. I like the thought promos & positive encouragement. A portable, user friendly, journal helps me not down thoughts on the fly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app I like it even my cousin likes it to. There's no problem to this app I recommend this to everyone that has secrets"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect and easy to use 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly right, no problems."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Being using for years. Simple and nice. Easy to use. Overall great app 👍👍 kudos team"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the journal so far. I do wish there was the option of writing with a stylus\pen so it feels like a traditional journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, loving it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling in a more convenient way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yeah it's good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great diary app, I wish the pictures were uploaded at a higher quality"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"New to Journey and loving it! Love it that when adding foto, app prompt me with choice to change entry date to match foto date. Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use app when I need to write down my memories ... good simple app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love having a place to vent. A place that I feel is safe. Have never had any problems with ""lost entries"" like I did on a similar site! Thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Perfect! Brilliant!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm really loving this app. Simple to use, perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THE BEST Simple to use and good you can put a password,paid for life time,it's very affordable. Easy to retrieve all my journal entry even when I forgot the password, synchronize across devices 👏👏."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super. I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the new update and new look!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app has helped me get down my thoughts while going through a tough time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I thought this app was great for about the 1st three uses. Theres some issue in the journeys, that made it bug out on my tablet, and the last 2 entries were deleted. I also dont like that you cant do multiple journeys, as I like to log moning and night. Probably better off using Word and just getting a journal prompt list. I really hope to not lose another entry, as its moments of my life in refeection and typing that I cant get back. Journals should bbe about stress relief, not the other way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Mobile version is okay, but the website is vastly inferior/ web version just shows plain time line with no themes/colors/design elements. very boring. Mobile version does have wallpaper for front page, but nothing else.Would not recommend. Since purchasing have found several better versions that are not more expensive. NOTE; JOURNEY DOES NOT TELL YOU UP FRONT THAT THEIR MEMBERSHIP IS NOT REFUNDABLE. I GOT STUCK FOR 17.99"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used to use Diaro and I liked it but one major downside for me that it was forcing to use Dropbox and not able to use rich text. Journey on the other hand solved this issue. However I do wish that Journey would support Folder or Category so I can group different stuff. You can group by activity however activity is not editable to add more. please change activity to category and allow more flexibility. Tagging is very useful however I would really appreciate if you can include tagging during typing just like google keep. I love there is an option to one time purchase which I went for for both Android and IOs although I had to pay twice however its worth it. Pros: - One time purchase option - very easy to use and the UI looks nice - multiple ways to view your journals - tagging - geotagging - media support - rich text support - ...etc. the list can go on Cons: - no support for category or folder - easier way to modify tags - flexibility when using tags Overall I recommend this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You need to fix a few things guys, waiting for the next update, when is it coming?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes journaling easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying using Journal and I have upgraded to lifetime premium. But I wonder if there is any way you will be or could increase the number of images you can attach to a post and the number of videos, and be able to combine the attachment of images and videos to a post?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Choosing tags is difficult can you make it so already existing tags appear in a different section below typing field choosing tags from list is not convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't usually pay (even if it's just £0.99) to get premium if the free version is fine, but there is just something about this journal that I love so much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love with respect always Geoffrey Phillips n they only had one from my uncle and aunty sue I will never forget uncle if U do guess who U be answering too czapeche. Pop xxx"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app and I generally use it as gratitude journal 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the Journal App frequently, almost daily. It has a clean appearance, is easy to navigate and use and keeps prompts to a minimum."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Does what it needs to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Missing features: Habit, Fonts & Background Colour (customizable rainbow choice). Thanks for the reply!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the app. I had problems with spell check in the past, but that is working fine now. Twoapp studio recommended I use the Google keyboard which I do now, so maybe that made all my problems go away. I use this journey/; journal app across all my Google devices and I'm please to be able to journal wherever and whenever. I add pictures I've drawn to each journal entry and other pertinent artifacts and factoids. I got away from journalling for a while but I'm back now and this app helps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"One can only write and attach images in free version. No editing, no bold, no italic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app! I love how it can be used on a computer as well. I do wish the desktop version was wider on the screen and not so small. But overall I am very please and this was what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"9/19/17 Having a dedicated app helps keep me motivated to journal daily. Interface is clean and simple and the sync among my tablet, phone, and two PCs is flawless. Been using it for a few months now and it's great. 7/16/20 Three years later and I'm still using this app. Still love it. I really like the throwback feature that shows me old entries from earlier years on today's date. Nice touch. Dark theme is lovely. No complaints."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been aight"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving being able to save reminders from photos from years gone by to this app, in the year they happened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"much slower and difficult to navigate than previous update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not intuitive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and love that you can add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app 👍👍👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really useful. I still journal in analog, but having this in your pocket helps you to keep up the discipline, which in turn helps you to deal with life a little better (when done correctly). The lifetime (I hope) premium for the app is worth it.👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love it cos i get to write when ever i want to and they don't spam notifications to write every day maybe at most once a week? but it's never incessant probing which i luv great app :-))"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very very bad experience after one year. Don't use this app bcz this app do not give you an option of auto renewal billing. And it keeps your credit card details saved in their third party account. They do not have customer care representative to solve our issues as well. I'm unable to turn off my auto renewal of billing as per method shown on their official website. And their subscription don't even ask for otp."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love it. I keep a track of my ideas in this app everyday. Voice to speech, voice recording, pics, everything I need from a professional journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why do you need full name date of birth and access to our private cloud? That's a violation of privacy and looks dodgy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy & Nice interface with reasonable price"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great, however I have privacy concerns about sharing personal information with your servers. I would appreciate a way to encrypt my journal entries Edit: thanks for the response, I updated my review to 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I adore this app. No kinks getting in and out. All saved and synced!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for daily activities, Memories, Thoughts, Feelings, Stimulation ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for recording things from my life. I like the reminders and flash backs too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app just works. It functions well on my phone and my Chromebook. The interface is clean and neat and very intuative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just got the premium with a flash sale, super worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An amazing app to write down all the memories. I wonder is it possible to have a pinned section? Where you can have some entries remind you of lessons learnt in the past??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I simply love this app. It's a amazing way to keep my intimate think's security and in order. My mood never was so sort like right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for the soul"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a daily journal with calendar."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I bought the package with extra features and feel it is worth it. I use it from my computer sometimes as well. I like that it sends flashback alerts to previous entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had a previous positive comment, but didn't have room to write another: so had to clear that one. This morning I was discouraged about something that happened. I opened this Journal and was reminded of something I'd written FIVE years ago. The memory of that event so long ago brought great joy to my heart: lifting it out of discouragement. THANK YOU for such a helpful tool. I wish I didn't have to clear my previous positive entry, but this one is fresh, & I wanted to share it. THANK YOU."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It a brilliant app. I like it, because you can always Journal from anywhere anytime, with a wide range of gadgets without a hustle."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's pretty good. But I wish they also enable apple pencil"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Designed in a way for easy access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am having a great experience because, while being corrected, I'm learning correct grammer with Grammerly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"7 day free trial is not a free app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, keeps me motivated to write in the journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Editor still does not work well when having to edit, select, or paste text. Very poor. Also no longer prompts to change date/time of entry to match attached photos or files. Used to be great app, but has been on a steady decline in quality over the past year. Dev needs to focus on fixing issues rather than adding useless features. Now I'm looking for new journal app to replace this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oh no! I'm using it since February, and now i can't sign in using my Google account. Why this is happening? i want it back to be normal. Help me please!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I needed to vent and get the drama of a break up off my chest. This was cheaper than therapy, and certainly convenient and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Ended up with the paid version for the extra features. These extra features are well worth it. I will love continuing to use this as my Diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This diary is beautiful, easy and simple. I paid for premium (very affordable one off payment) and I am very happy with it, especially all the features i.e. different fonts and colours, wallpapers etc. You can really make it your own. I only have one small problem. It's annoying when you save your diary entry you have to then enter your pin again. This gets tedius if you go in and out a few times. You should only have to use the security pin to get IN to the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using Journey. This app has been a constant companion as I script my thoughts and happenings. Easy to use always available syncing between my devices. Been using it for about a year now. Moved all memories to this app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really helps me. The free version can do so much. I am considering to buy the full version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a nice place to place sweet memories that I'll forget otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's really great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can upload pictures to go with your journey Easy and fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is beautiful digital journal .. it's becoming a witness of my autobiography.. hehehe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's okay and easy to use via mobile or online."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bad subscription model. Offers a 50% discount after dismissing the first Premium ad prompt. Not a cool way for first time subscribers. I don't appreciate apps that are supposed to help with depression and anxiety when they have a annoying and disturbing (at least) behaviour"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient and smart way to log diary entries. Useful to record daily movement during this COVID19 time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I upgraded to premium almost immediately. Great program! I use it everyday. I'm a writer and public speaker so it's perfect for keeping track of my writings and notes. Highly recommend!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't sign in! every time i try there shows up a ""denied wifi access"" sign. What should i do?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal. I may subscribe but can not afford it now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app syncs across all my devices, Android and Mac, it's easy to use and looks great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app is free for a few days. Then it cost $2.49 a month. I deleted as soon as I was informed I will be charged a fee for something I can write on paper for NO monthly fees. I UNINSTALLED before I typed one word, so I cannot give an opinion whether this is a good app. I gave it two stars because it wasn't clear before I downloaded the app there was a monthly fee. If I had known I wouldn't have wasted my time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful journaling app. I love the clean interface and the ability to organize simply with tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I have lifetime premium but some coach contents are still locked from me. Please also don't limit the coach to one at a time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years and I love it. Easy to use. Loved it so much that I bought the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app no lie . I had this for two years . Delete it and redownload many of times and work and saved All my entries since day one ... Absolutely love this .. thank you for making this app ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using this app for quick journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works great, but kinda expensive, since you have to pay for the mobile and computer applications separately (or pay a monthly subscription)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, has everything you need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be nice to be able to add more pictures per entry (even 5 would be great), but I love the feature! I use it for tattoo inspiration, 1 entry per idea :) That's why more pictures would help. But I really like the interface, like the search bar!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years now. I love it. I have the subscription version now, which allows me to use my phone, laptop, or tablet and it all syncs. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is that is doesn't always sync well between my ipad and my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I didn't use it very long before I found an app that I liked better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, really simple and nice format"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love the ""coach"" which gives you themed prompts of your choosing as springboards for getting the words flowing during times you feel a bit at a loss for what to write about!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app, but I like the design of a competitor more... However, Journey won over the other one in my mind because it's works pretty much every where... iPhone, Android, Windows, and I have all three."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for about 10 months now and have had a great experience. Easy to add photos/video/audio and texts. My only suggestion is I am a premium member and I would like to stop receiving ads for the subscription service. I bought the lifetime membership because I plan to use it for years. It would be nice for it to stop asking me to sign up for monthly payments instead."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Stop telling me to rate your app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used this 5 years and forgot about it. Came back to it today and found everything I had penned down still there. It's great having these memories back. I'm definitely getting the premium version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I write about my day, or significant things as well as my fitness each day and what I did and how long Th e session was! It has no ads expect for making your account premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This was what I wanted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great, especially the ability to have a password just for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tried to add a video several times to my entry. I was planning to use the app as a video diary. But when I tried to add my first video, it deleted the whole thing and took up all the storage on my phone even though it didn't save the video. I then tried customer support which, as it usually is, was useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome! I really like thebease of use. I can easily attach pictures and locations to my entries. No more buying binders or hard journals. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please add the option too select pictures or videos from other apps like Google photos or Amazon photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this, genuinely love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for saving moments that I dont want made public on social media"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE this app!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I got the upgrade & it is my best app purchase thus far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful journalling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. It's done very well in helping me reflect on my past thoughts and behavior. Not only that but, being the person I am, it's really helped me get things off my chest. Thanks to all this, I feel like my life has been brighter; even if it's just a smudge, it's certainly been brighter. Developers, thank you so much for this gorgeous app. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Easy to use and its absolutely AMAZING!! Definitely recommend this app to everyone!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love love!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very simple way to keep myself up to date with my thoughts and feelings 😂🤭 Really, though. I do love this app. I like Journaling on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You automatically charged me twice! You deducted 1,550 php from my account this month of July 6, 2020 when I just paid for an annual subscription last June 9, 2020 and it said my subscription will renew not until the next year of June 9, 2021! Please check and give back what you stole! You charged me twice! I have screenshots to prove! There is a crisis for goodness sake! And you are robbing me of what I badly need for this pandemic right now! I've already emailed you! Please take notice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Maybe it's a great app, but hitting me with ads as soon as I open it? Making me pay extra to format text? Nah, I'm good. ""At least take me out to dinner before you try to..."""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for logging my miles for xc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best journaling app I've used and I've used a lot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Waste of money, pay an absurd amount for premium membership only to be unable to use the premium features unless you upgrade your membership to an even more absurd amount. Don't waste your money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is great and has a nice feature set. My only complaint is that I purchased the lifetime premium but still don't have every feature because they added an additional 'membership' that's a pay-as-you-go with other features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, easy to use, lots of options (text, photos, mood, location, weather, etc...). Perfect for both documenting your life and writing reflectively. 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it to help my therapist with my day to day. It's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good experience, easy journaling. It has lost some of my pictures, but all the journal entries are maintained thankfully."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Besides the pop up stuff its a nice little daily journal ... i use it for my fitness journal which reminds me what i did, how far i have come and motivation to keep going and that i can do it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep track of happy memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great journalling app, you get what you pay for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use! Nice features even without upgrading!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, it's easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for several years now, what's bugging me is the ad 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Solid product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app only missing reminders"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome and simple and does as advertised. BUT Its syncing method is really annoying at times. I update journal entries on my computer but insert pictures through my phone. At times, even when I make sure that my phone and computer are 100% synced, my phone would override my computer updates and delete all my entries that day. All of them. I hate this the most as I am a very detail oriented and extensive journal writer. Rewriting those deleted entries are stressful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Should have paid more attention, you install it and give it access to your google, then after that it asks you to subscribe and pay after 7 day free trial. I don't know why anyone would pay to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Didnt even work"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So far, so good. I like the coaching prompts, helpful for someone getting the hang of journaling. I don't like media limits - 1 video and 2 photos isn't too much to ask. I haven't tried out all features yet like weather that rely on giving additional permission. Will update review after a few more weeks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only one that stores videos 🤩"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Everything required is there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No doubt it's a good app but most irritating thing is most features are premium and the price is also high!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Love that i can update from my phone while out and about if i have thoughts and sit down to write more in depth on my tablet at home. Being able to search and insert tags to read entries where certain characteristics played out helps a lot with introspection."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really like this app. i use it quite a bit n it does the job well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app - made me start writing again"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was confused about whether they were going to require money. I uninstalled immediately after installing because it said something about a subscription and I couldn't determine if I was going to be able to use the app without paying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that it's so user friendly. Great app for the person that has little time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bounced around various journal/diary apps and always come back. Great interface, stays simple while adding little bonus functions slowly, without screwing things up. Basically perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only problem i have with this app, when you buy the lifetime membership, it's only for the device type you bought it for. I bought it for Android... But it was not there for PC. But the application itself still works on PC. Just no lifetime membership on PC. Why would they do that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent and easy to use Journal tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Going to try it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use as a journal and includes some great add on guides on various aspects of personal growth with questions for you to ponder on and answer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dope"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Text when using phone app doesn't match text when using computer app. Character codes show up on computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It's easy to use and I like that it shows you your entries from 1 month/ 1year ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. Much better than the other ones I tried to install. No wonder this app got editors choice in 2019. Really good app. The only issue is that when I go into the app it offers me to pay for premium, which is a tiny bit annoying. Just a minor issue. Overall, great app, 4 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good 👍 for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I get to write out my thoughts and feelings freely..journey is helping me find my true self"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please add auto night mode, needing it! Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient! I love the night mode feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to diary my day to day thingss"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I got a lifetime premium subscription on a few different clients, the app is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dead handy.just works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Free version. I like it 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LIVE FOR JOURNEY!!! Okay so maybe that was a little bit dramatic. Honestly, I really do enjoy this app my favorite feature with a paid membership is the prompts and the assistance and also the fact that it reminds me to write about myself everyday so I don't ever forget. This reminds me how important it is to you sometimes take a step back and taking inventory of where we are in life and where our emotions are and where everyone around us is as well, emotionally speaking that is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Works swift. You want a 21century diary, here it is!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, I can type it and forget it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best App in this Genre.... You can save your quotes, images & videos as same as you did with your diary... Use it for 3 years... Even after changing my mobile it keeps my data I have satisfied & very wonderful experience with this App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use I paid for the upgrade but cphysically it's pretty easy to use and dependable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Diary app out in the wile ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so awesome. Plus you don't even need to buy the whole package to enjoy so many awesome features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just saying, I feel like an option to disguise the app would be nice. Anyone who says that this is pointless because someone shouldn't be on your phone, explain the password option. Alot of lock apps can disguise themselves as calculators, and if you put in a certain number it unlocks to the actual app settings and all. I dont know if this will even be seen, but I personally feel like it's a good idea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing. Works exactly like I need too. Easy interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me remember my trips, moods, and exercise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is good and convenient to have a personal journal like journey app to share everyday things and stuffs that we do with the function to add pictures as well. And I also love the notification asking me how it's been, the calendar and the mood chart. This is really amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not a fan of pressure tactics. If you think the app is worth what you're charging, give people time to try it before inviting them to subscribe. Shortly after I opened the app, I was presented with a 50% off offer that was only available then and there. When I went to check it out, it displayed a minute countdown."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Trial membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it great way, to keep my memories and thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal writing just got more interesting!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice to see the history"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Just started. Like it do far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, with everything I need for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and reasonable price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app a lot. I like how simple it is. There's not much options available but I like the ones are already in it, like the font style and the dark theme. I like how simplistic it looks, and how easy it is to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish we could use more than one coach, I wish they gave formats in android versions as well, In my ipad they give the 5 min journal, gratitude journal formats but not on android"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, wish I would use it more than I do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good. Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's so handy to write your thoughts, and how you feel and pretty much ideas you have, it's also great to re read them and reflect!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been a great way to keep track of memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the function of this app. I love the reminders and the ease of adding a picture. However I am not pleased with the way I was charged and the struggled to find how how to view my membership. I read when I signed up for my free trial that it would alert me prior to charging me and it didn't. So now I've paid for a year and am not sure I would have actually done that.... A little shadey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I tried filling out a billing form I got an email to say you'd be in touch in 2-5 days, that was over a week ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app, serves its purpose, i use it to document my dreams"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"BEST JOURNAL APP EVER NO ADS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. Although I am still getting in the habit of journals, this app makes it easy. The UI is beautiful and feels great to interact with. Every time I look back at my memories in this journal, I feel amazing and I think part of it is because the app is so beautiful to look at."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. This has allowed me to connect with myself daily, as well as use this as an anchor when I may drift. Enjoy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app!! Not only does it savey account so I can log in on different devices but I can delete the app of I need space, reinstall it months later, and everything is still there. Haven't been able to afford the premium yet but I wish I could because without it it's awesome. I'm sure it just gets better!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hi team, You have the feature to lock journal on the phone but can't find any feature for the web application. This is bothering me too much. Can you suggest anything?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing, helpful, easy and life changing! Thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app as a private replacement for the journaling I was doing on facebook. I like being able to add pictures or video. It adds the date, time and a geotag to each entry. I appreciate that it closes immediately and requires a passcode to enter. The only thing I wonder is whether I will be able to export it to a printing service like ""My Social Book"" for facebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am impressed with the advantages this way of taking notes and event's has on my daily activities to track and control the information in my life that are important to me. Tags to quickly find what I am looking for once saved. I purchased this program, I am so innammered with its layout and ease of use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its been great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Essential information is unclear such as Can I pay the Special, I4.99 before the end of the year or do I have to be charged 29.99 anyway"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch payment issues, super rude customer service that switches between people & bots, editor didn't even work. Pass this one up, awful experience!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!! Very helpful!!It's just what it says a diary/ journal!! It allows you to enter a passcode Everytime you log on in order to remain private!! Very helpful tool!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm seeing reviews and OT said its good so u get it and... It's not free and I have to get rid of it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having a place for my thoughts that I can tag, organize and go back to easily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app and the usability. The lifetime membership is also very reasonable. I use this app quite often and it helps me share things when without sharing it with anyone 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'll never want anything else."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love love this app. It help me so much in journaling my Bible readings and thoughts. I use this app daily. Please assist to check a bug in current build where it's not possible to go to New line unless you put a punctuation. It's really annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't use all of the amazing extra features but the fact that I can sync across all my devices and view on the web is absolutely critical and Journey gets it right! From adding photos and videos, the ""Throwback"" Feature, and multiple backup and export options, you won't be disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like Journey, because it is simple to use. Just start typing (or voice/speaker works too)! Annual membership is reasonable. I like the new coaching links provided. The mood icons could be a good way to see trends. I have been using it many years and am still happy with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I needed something that could help me journal, but not leave me another book to carry or lose. This is am ideal app for just that. Simple and straightforward. Not another app that wastes more of my time trying to figure out how to use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So Glad I Found Journey!! I recently started writing about me and Journey has made it so easy and accessible to write anywhere and anytime! Wasn't going to do the membership/subscription but GLAD I did! Lots of extra features and they only add to the ease and aesthetic of this one of a kind App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm still new to it so I'm still learning all the functionality. Do love the fact that I can post files, pictures, and posts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"ভালো"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi. I love this app and have Lifetime Premium membership. Why am I not able to access the same information through Journey on my laptop, it doesn't show that I have Lifetime Premium membership and it is not syncing and alot of my journey information is missing on my laptop. Any suggestions why please?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I thought this would be fantastic for my additional needs, however there is a charge every week to use the app. NO THANK YOU"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for more than 3 years now. And I absolutely love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I would like to able to write with a S-Pen just to give it that journal feeling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app and think the free version is very user friendly. However I wish there wasn't a limit on how many photos you can add to an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very friendly user interface . Never had any problem with app. It feels vary good to see all my importent and not import thaughts at one place .. everyone should keep their thaughts at some place like this . Note book is not secure it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, one should always remember each day with a memory."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app, didn't have a question in my mind about subscribing. Really well put together, it's easy to use and sends me reminders to add stuff to my journal, it really helps me keep on top of things as I try to get into journalling as often as I can. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Straightforward and usable. Dark mode is a paid feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is my first premium purchase and after four years I attest it's worth it! I want my students to try this as well so it would be nice to have the word count feature. Also, the entry keeps automatically saving and publishing when I switch apps on my phone (i.e. when I want to check an app to edit my entry) so I use another note app first. Then, when I paste, the spacing does not apply (like when I allocate one space before one paragraph) so the format is not sustained."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app bought the premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Cool but too expensive. Can't do anything cool for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Day one and I'm already so grateful for purchasing this. I've been struggling to organize/ prioritize my life but I am confident that I can utilize this tool to help me stay organized and work with my therapist to help me keep on growing and challenging myself. I've had a lot of journals in my life so having an online cross platform friendly journal is incredible. Thank you everyone who worked hard developing this I really appreciate all of you !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I'm a very visual person so being able to add graphics to each of my entries helps keep me focused and interested in coming back daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Sure team . Can you atleast provide option for 1 time buy . Past review : Can provide freemium service like competitiors"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The system of writing and interface can be improved and by that I mean it can be made a little more simple and more snappy as it seems a little buggy sometimes. But this is the best journal app that I've tried. 👍🏽"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. 4 years later still a fantastic app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So wonderful and Lovely To Use. I Love it. However, i will advice that subfolder to it and also include alternative of line pages and not only plain pages. Thank you. God bless you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Many beneficial features that help with organization & filtration. Really bad problem is that my pin is 5 digits, & I only have to put in 4 to gain access. Fix this! That's you're 2 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to open, write thoughts, whatever I want. Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! I can keep all my THOUSANDS of entries safe and secure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love how easy it is to use this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great. Even though I'm using the free version, this app still helped me a lot. I've always wanted a journal of some sorts, and now I've found it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice & simple👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using this journal for awhile and I've always really loved it! Recently, I took a break for awhile and came back to find tons of new features added which was exciting at first. I started up a coaching program, but it has been glitched on ""day one"" for several days. No matter how many times I answer the prompt, it just won't move me forward. Such a bummer! As a journaling app, I love this one, I just wish all the features worked!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you for making this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the design and the experience of Journey. Please let us attach more videos?! *or a mix of videos and pictures, please. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It says this is a free app with in app purchases which needs to be clairified. Its only free for a week. There are literally hundreds of the ones that arw free!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps alot in managing my day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good enough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app..but every thing is paid....great app for people willing to pay little more money ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quite a nice app! It's a bit hard to find the plus sign!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good interface to make journaling very convenient. Web version needs improvement."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app and the interface, but I wish there could be folders within the app so that I can categorize different entries accordingly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"7 day trial: $29.88 billed annually"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had this since 2015, and it helped me a lot that I just had to support & pay for its lifetime premium. Love all the improvements since then. But I also hope the app can eventually support m4a file, so I won't have to convert my voice recordings to mp3. Thanks & regards!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Is it paid service?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"NOT FREE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app.. although I thought I had bought it but now it seems I have to pay more to get the full thing?? Bit misleading to be honest.. I feel like I've wasted my money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I didn't realise how helpful writing this journey would be, its definitely worth trying for the mental clarity, understanding and recording your thought processes, and it's great looking back and remembering little moments that would surely have been forgotten without recording them on here!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found these guys awhile ago because I wanted practicality and cross platform syncing across many platforms. Sometimes you have an inspiration to put your thoughts to the journal but having to find the right platform accessible could leave you to lose your idea if you lose focus. Having it on mobile and pc makes it excellent. I do like flashy stuff though like Dayone had for making a book version and all those pretty affects but in the long run its all about having availability at that time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great. Very well laid out. Easy to use. The lifetime membership is cheap too. One thing I would add is the ability to create subfolders of journals as opposed to having the one 'Journey'. I would like to have my Journey folder, but also ones for creative inspiration, business ideas, notes about work. A filing system that is bigger than the use of tags. Great app otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey! It's so easy to use and has available Coach that gives you tips on how to journal effectively. It's simple, yet efficient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Must download"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good... need to be improved to be more engaging ...but dont know how ... I paid around 700 bucks... I dont know for what exactly... need to find its usefulness"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's My JOURNEY"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"El modo oscuro y el markdown son de pago"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal app I have used so far and kept it for so long, almost 3-4 years. Though I stopped writing for sometime, but I always come back to it whenever I want to jot down my personal thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best for me. It is password protected. I can literally just write everything i have in mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and elegant journaling app with a few added features to explore your journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Your great work really helping me. Thank q Keep it up!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It takes your data and info, the tells you it's a paid software"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I don't have a problem with their business model but they pick the worst times to prompt me to upgrade. To elaborate on that, I often use the app to quickly jot down my thoughts when I'm stressed or anxious. The prompts get in the way, they slow me down and distract me. I would have a much better experience if the prompts came after I have saved what I have written."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal with alot of extra features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Rating this app 5 stars:)) i can save my memories here, then the calendar keep my know that i must use ""gratitude"" - the magic every day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for 4 years. Very simple and useful. I recommend it for everyone. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for keeping a daily journal... reminders, images, location tracking, etc... great for what I'm using it for!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Baru beberapa hari menggunakan app ini. Semoga makin baik ke depannya. Sukses terus."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's nice App but I have 2 comments: First, it would be better if you add option to set, measure & track goals and habits Second, most of features should be purchased, it would be better if you mention in the description part of the app about purchased features, so people can decide to download the app or not!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's my main journal and does exactly what it is designed to do. You can personalize a lot of your content with pictures and moods. I use it purely for processing inner thoughts and have never had a problem with it. I get a sense of pleasure every time I scroll through my days and get a glimpse of where I was at the time. I bought the upgraded version to support the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Android app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not happy about the costs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was trying this for a couple of days until I received an e-mailed transcript of yesterday's (private) journal entry reminding me that my cat had died. There's nothing wrong with my short term memory, but this app is now uninstalled and long forgotten."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Every feature falls flat, if I can't access it only. I set pass code, and now I cannot access it. It his just the second day. I did not link it to my accounts or buy premium because I wanted to try it out for a few days first. But Thank God! The money would have been a waste. It is not accepting the passcode I put in. Time waste."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"After the lifetime premium purchase the web version not allowing me to access the full features of my account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Previous review deleted. Interesting.....I just wanted to review the developer response to my previous review. Can't stop notifications. All notifications turned off but still getting notifications from this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Almost all basic features for free. Pro features looks cooler 😎. Wish I could buy permanent membership 👉🥺👈. Any discount for non earning students."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using since 2017. Great app. Simple but personal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very theraputic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app....found all that i needed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and nice UI. Would like the ability to add custom items to the journey rather than it just being the weather or location etc. For example alcohol units."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, very well made, full of great features.I haven't tried any of the others, don't feel like I need to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very clean and simple design with no trouble using while off the internet (this is really important for me). The writing prompts you get every day, if you choose to receive them, really help get the writing juices going! To be honest I used them for my fictional character building than for myself, but it was incredibly useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've only used the free version but it is really user friendly and is everything I need in a journal. I especially love how I can tag the entries to easily find subjects and see thr growth in mindset over time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app to record my happiness. as user with annual membership, there are PLENTY of cool features, and I have yet to explore all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Thought I had deleted without ever using and without signing up for anything but line behold it just appears again! Totally useless details on unsubscribing..just tells me to cancel membership in the android play store..only option is to uninstall, so I did but whether it will work is anyones guess.. wish I'd never installed it in the first place!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has allowed me to decompress and keep track of my life. I have been looking for a convenient way to journal for a long time. This is it. The flexibility between website and app and the ability to use a full list of features and formatting functions has made this one of my new best friends. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"If I could give this app 0 stars I would. I signed up for a year, used it a few times, and found it was not useful so I forgot about it. Then a year later I received an invoice for another year--it was already paid and unrefundable. It was also MUCH more than the first year. Also, there was no notice that renewals were soon due--just a note that I had paid an inflated renewal fee. One has to remember the fine print on the web site, not in their emails to me. Their position is 365 days ago when I clicked on a payment I should have been thinking about the renewal, and assuming they would not provide any notice of the bill."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What if we forgot the password?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am happy about this app.. Diary can listen all ur probllms without boring that's why I like it nd love it.. Tq u tq u journey app. Am very satisfied about this app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"NOT FREE. Nowhere in the app description states you are only downloading a trial. after reading comments the free version isn't worth my time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Great for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Would like it better if you could comment under images in a similar fashion to Day One, or to upload photos AND videos, but otherwise does everything it needs to do well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it a few days and it's simple enough. I like that I can record voice notes or videos instead or along with writing. I like that I can create several journal entries in a day. The daily prompts are thought provoking; nice touch. Not sure i need to pay for a membership yet; we'll see what happens a few months down the road."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's important to keep a journal to mark your own progress. And of course, it's critical that it be private. So I like everything about this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, easy to use and great features for guaranteed privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The contents the app offers have been utilized to help me through some very difficult times in my life! I always had a rough time Prayer Journaling (even though I knew it was something which helped me) until I began making a consistent habit of it on this app! I am going to purchase the upgraded version, not necessarily because I need it, but because I just want to support the the Journey app! I recommend this app to anyone who wants to make a consistent habit of Journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Virtual coach helps center me. I recommend 👍🏿"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, elegant."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Something is a bit wrong. App keeps crashing on Note9 moment it's opened.... What to do?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the app, I just wish I could change the time stamps when I want to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Versatile and fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Should be free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for three years now. Love it. First journal that I haven't lost. The digital nature of it is unfortunate, but I have given up on myself and paperback journals. Therefore this has to do, and I have gotten used to it. Some 200 entries later I am proud of myself and happy that I can revisit my old thoughts and memories. It's worth it, my fellow humans, get journaling :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Give dark mode for free. It's not too much to ask for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it so far. I'm still trying to figure out if I like the electronic version or the old fashioned hand written journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying using this app. Great reminders and the coach is fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. You can add photographs and documents every day. No need for a diary anymore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would rate it 5 stars if there was a better selection of fonts. Otherwise though, been using this app for years now and have both upgrades (membership and subscription). Love that I can look back on a year ago this day and read how I was feeling/what I was going through and how much things have changed. Please add more fonts tho!! That's actually the main (we'll, the only) reason I bought the lifetime upgrade. Highly recommend out of all the journal apps out there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Can't use because of this limitation 2016 initial post 2020 and still same limitations?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use and when you use it for about a month you seriously considering to buy an upgraded version. Congratulations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good little app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you have a subscription, make sure you are logged into Google Play under the correct email. I forgot which one to use when I switched carriers, so I couldn't access Journey properly. Definitely a face palm moment. I still love this app, it is useful for tracking a lot of different things, and I can take it to the doc. Side note: the location & movement detection aspects are creepy as hell, even though they are useful. Choose for yourself what to track. TY, Journey. You keep my secrets well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As far i use it.. it's feel really calming to see the app design, good job for the developer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app. I have been using it for many years now. It's great I highly recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Journey is off to a good start but the user experience is still not great. You still can't compare it to Day One on iOS for example. - you can't open multiple journals all you have is tags - you cannot add photos in line with the text. You also cannot view all the photos you added to a post at once like dayone or diario - it's way way too pushy in terms of call to action. I for one immediately upgraded to try full membership but I but it definitely compromisess the initial experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Your trial link is kinda hidden. So when i signed up it was literally forcing me to signup for a membership. which i did (annual membership) and cancelled within 10 minutes because of some lagging, feature related issues. I understand your so called ""policy"" etc. But I humbly asked if you could make an exception and issue a refund and your billing team just rejected that request with a standard reply (I asked them twice via email). Stay away from this company or be prepared to lose your money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE APPS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💛💚💙💗💖💕❤️💓🖤💜💛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like that its easy to use and has many useful features. Although, it is a bit pricey for a word document app. You can use all the paid features on this app on Google docs for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Though I wish they'd provide more features for those who use it for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Really enjoy it so far. Makes keeping track of everything easy. Great that you can add pics and locations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free. Please advertise with cost, don't lie about it being free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app. I love that I can either write, speak or shoot a video to do an entry and attach files, etc. I would love to be able to record video from the app in my windows computer, since it only let's you attach a video and is not as convenient. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!! So cute and easy to use. I love the mood chart and the daily coach tips. It has everything I need for my journalling. The only thing I'd suggest is to insert the ability of adding images/attachments in the middle of the text, so you can visualise as you move on your storytelling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for 3 years. Nice, clean and useful :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just exploring your app now for some months, liking so long.. and thinking it would be fun to connect it to Spotify or to have ability to add a song. Also to have a bit more coaches... For example long term but the short term too( I'm having now one year gratitude, but kind of would like to have some of the mounthly, or at least one, coaches too) Good luck😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App to use to keep a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Journey and find it to be a great dairy app. It keeps track of temp, location and I record life events. The input is also excellent. I add pictures when possible. All in all, excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just reinstalled after two years and got my journals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. It is a wonderful one to have. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recently downloaded the Journey journaling app. What I like about it is I can just TALK to it to get things off my mind. It feels like THERAPY! So many neat bells & whistles that I've already spent the $9 bucks & upgraded to premium!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far its pretty good i been using it and i really like it and it helps me through out my day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better than ""just"" a journal app. The more you use it, the more capabilities you find Really enjoy liking locations and photos. Wish I could export specified range/s to PDF. June 2020 update - still loving this app. It's the best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, l store some of my Libraries from YouTube here, it's easier to open. I put my thoughts down if l have any, trying not to have thoughts, l haven't tried yet to work out all the different applications to journey, what l have is great 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app! Very accesible. Nice lay-out and I could attach pictures!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app. It would be good to have option to insert bullet or numbered sentences"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ease of use simple to add entries I'm considering to subscribe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy it. Makes me want to reflect and write about my day. Tags are simple. Not so much distracting features and categories like some other Journal apps. Love that it works on any OS."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best app journal ever. It has everything you need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. By using journals Im able to release my anger and frustrations without hurting anyone feelings and it also boosts my confidence"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome experience for journal of many activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am finally writing daily encouraged by the app's reminder function. Great app. June 6, 2020 Still my favorite app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good but expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"privacy test failed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't tell me it's free then give me a 7 day trial before a subscription paywall"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Been using it a bit the last three days. Much easier than some other journalling apps I've tried. I love how easy it is yet it doesn't force you down a certain format. Keep up the good work guys."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! I love using it to journal thoughts and things I learn in day to day life. It's great that there's a mobile and browser client."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent journal program"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my personal body building progress app and it's been my main tool since day one. Must have app if you have any goals in life and want to organize your thoughts and progress."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing. I use it to maintain a coffee journal and it has been a wonderful experience with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really do love this app. The only complaint I have is how frequently it asks me to rate the app when I press later, but now that I have a good feel for the app, I decided it was indeed time to rate it. I am able to gather my thoughts, add pictures to go with them, edit even days later, and I'm able to save and see my location, the weather, and my mood, and what I'm doing while journaling. I haven't gone premium yet but probably will. The free features are sublime though by themselves."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free. Immediately uninstalled when informed 7 day trial is free then monthly charges. This should be clear in the app summary before install."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's easy to use. I like being able to add photos to entries. I Like the widgets but I would like to be able to change the size, color, and transparency to match my screen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that it reminds me to make a journal entry whether it's a quick write or a journal entry for the day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Journaling allowed me to better understand myself. I would recommend it to anyone. App is easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app to journal my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worse app and useless. Using extortion techniques to get you subscribed. I'm stuck with a one year sub that costed me 50 bucks that I don't even want and can't do anything about it. Total scammers. This practice should be banned!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very easy and friendly app! I have it installed in various devices and it syncs great! It helps me with the notifications I have settled. I use this app as a Gratitude Journal, and it keeps me motivated. The emotions icons, activity and attachments are a plus. They remind me how blessed I've been in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really handy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very pleasant experience. Makes journaling enjoyable, as it should be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have high hopes Update: I'm fighting depression for a long time and after installing the app again, I saw my post from 2 years ago. I didn't expect that it will be there. It made me feel a little better. And I'm just using the free version. This app is worth purchasing. Kudos to the developers! Thank you for putting a smile on my face today. I hope you continue to improve the app and gain success from it, as it helps more people. God bless you guys! Keep safe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. It's so much organized dairy..it's more than my expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the versatility across electronics. The one-time fee isn't outrageous and I overall like the structure of the app. It's simple and not overbearing. Definitely give the free version a shot!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So, I love everything about this app EXCEPT for whatever reason, google photos is no longer appearing when I try to attach a photo. Why is that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this journal because you can have different ways to enter my thoughts and actions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really easy and intuitive to use. The free version comes with a pretty large toolbox so I am happy with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app. So many apps try to do too much. This one allows you to keep a journal, provides reminders and prompts on what to write about."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey now on ChromeOS & Android for several years, and upgraded to lifetime premium a year ago, as I've always found Journey to be a great product, and frankly they deserve my money. Journey does a lot more than I need though, so membership isnt for me. I heartily recommend Journey, but note that using the Android app on Chrome OS would benefit from a desktop style spellcheck (will try the linux version & see if that fixes it)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this apps so much !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've never journaled but I'm starting to learn how to do it. I actually started because my psychiatrist wanted me to start writing down like three happy things out of the day before I go to bed at night. So I decided to get a journal to keep track of that. so I started doing that and then I find myself writing a little more here and there and it seems to be getting more and more and I think this app is awesome. It's got a lot of really cool features and I like that you can use different platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app ty"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very usfull for write down your thought and etc. Wirte and calmdown."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant,easy to use,add photos. Notification reminders every so often"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I love Journal-ling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app😊😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Says free but its only a 7 day trial then either $3.33 annually according the first page then when you click okay it changes to $39.99. I have screenshots to show this. I was excited at first because the advertising says free but disappointed that the advertising is false. Uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful ..great work. keep it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Downloaded it free. Not looking to pay for an app. As soon as u download it says free for 7 days then u have to start paying. Waste of space and time in my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wanted an art journal and this is working well. When I add a new entry with a photo of my artwork, it automatically changes the date of the entry and adds other details such as weather and location - not necessary for my purpose but pretty cool. I enjoy seeing the progress I have made through using this app. I like that there are other purposes I could use this for, such as gratitude."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm sure this is a good enough app but its a pity that they don't refund you if you cancel your membership on the same day it ends."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great got me into maintaing a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The base platform is really great I'm sure I'll love the premium version even more. If you're honest with yourself, this app will help you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have enjoyed using this app to keep record of my thoughts and plans. How I wish it was slightly cheaper to subscribe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the Job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In simple words I love this Journal!!! If I could give it more then five stars I would. It's a must try!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Been trying to get a refund since January."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the app everyday at least I try to it's a good app I recommend it to anybody"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bought premium. I use it to record my journey with God. Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you for making the user interface a lot better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great sleek design, never force stop or fail. love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst app of google itz asking money for everything and voice notes also... I love Google apps a lot but this app totally irritated me plz change microphone for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Easy to use and lets you go back to add pics and details to previous dates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, Easy to use. A lot of features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a neat little app. I use it more like a scrapbook to collect all my pictures and write down little blurbs about them. Occasionally I like to go back and look at some of them and I realized I forgot some of the stuff that happened on the days that I took those photographs. It serves its purpose as a little Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is an easy way to get down a daily thought. It has so many extra functions that are very simple to use for example adding a photo to a daily reflection."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Laggy web app, limited free features and costly to subscribe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, so glad I paid to have the full version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Focus of this app moved from 'smooth user experience' to 'forcing repeatedly to upgrade'. Homescreen layout changed with unnecessary option to upgrade. Edit: I consider and appreciate each and every effort in building the app. Further, the functionality I require is already available without premium. Moreover, I was disappointed, since after 2 years I downloaded the app and many things were downgraded instead of upgrades."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Its good for daily writing But you also write Google notes So its waste of space and memory"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for family memories! I write a line a day, and it tells me what happened this day for the past years. I can add pictures or a video each day and I look forward to sharing memories with my kids of their entire lives: funny, cute, terrible, memorable, it's all in there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"- Very long time for a note to load + only a few moods - many taps to attach an image + nice calendar view + tags"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!! This is exactly what I need in my life to keep record of all the fun my growing family has each day. Can't wait to print it all out into a book at te end of the year!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Changing my name initial review, there is a free version of this & it's terrific! Loaded with far more features than you would ever think you need, but are invaluable!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just started to use the app. For not being a journalist, it is easy and convenient to use. I plan to get more familiar with its writing prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been a terrible journaler for years. I finally bstartes actively using this app... And what a difference! It sends me reminders when it detects new photos I've taken. I can quickly add them to a new post (it also detects the date, so it can back date a post to match old photos) and save it. I then switch to my laptop and write my wordy journal entry ( rcause I prefer that over writing on my phone). I think there's hope for me, now! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool to keep you organized just gotta keep the habit of doing it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too unsafe to use. To the developers: When a user wants maximum security and is willing to put up with the tedium of re-entering their pass every time they tab out, it's safe to assume that allowing snapshots of their screen on tabbing would get to be a deal breaker. ... And the screen should also always lock after being turned off! At the very least these security features should have opt in support. As it stands, this app is too unsafe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much! It has a beautiful interface and very easy to use. It fits needs exactly. I just have a slight suggestion. I think it would be fun if you can customize the color for a journal entry instead of just having them all as white. Just a fun suggestion to make things more customizable :). Overall, great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for jotting down notes and experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy, intuitive, fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I couldn't ask for more - thank you (coming from competitor who made it hard to switch from 🍎)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app is great, but why do I have to pay for some ""coach"" programs? I already bought the life-time premium; so it was another sneaky way of taking money from customers, if the life-time premium doesn't give you all the experience, what's the point in buying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't get past the first page."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's great but a lot of adds"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I still get pretty bad bugs while typing in this app. Also, the reminder doesn't work at all. The wallpaper has bugs too while setting it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been nearly 2weeks since I got this and it's simply one of the best app that I've ever downloaded. Passcode option is useful. You can attach pictures and video which is something extra which is lovely. Highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it because it's locked. It's easy to use. When I take pictures it allows me to write about that day. I bough the premium and its going really well. Definitely recommend it. Enjoy and happy journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday, I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's fine, but the paywalling of dark mode is enough to knock you down a few stars. Re-evaluate your interests. Do you expect us to pay money to use a simple feature? If we like your app, we will continue to use it down the line. Don't be ludicrous with your expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Im an avid fan of this app. Of all the diary app i tried, this is the best so far. Ui is easy to understand, it has tags for easy searching, u can add pictures, add activities, customize everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"How to disable the coach card? I don't want coaching, why are you bothering me with coaching advertise. I have already paid for the app, I don't expect such intrusive ads after paying money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Installed, opens and instantly uninstalled! Right from the start it wanted true many permission s. And it said right off it's sharing everything with everybody it can. Is that really what you want in a personal jurnal? If I could give it no stars I would."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I found the app a bit too busy. The UI had soo much going on that for someone who already struggles (with mental health) it felt a bit much sometimes. Also I don't see the point of paying for lifetime only to realize you have to pay another fee to sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app goes with me every single where. The only thing I would change is the graphics. Could be better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to journal and include lots of details about what is happening in your life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It has helped me with journaling. It's easy to use. Very beautiful. I'll be using this for a very long time 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has really helped me since my fiancee passed away suddenly in November 2019. I am able to track my thoughts, tag pics to those thoughts. Like the layout. Keep up the great work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Lots of good features without having to purchase a membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this App. Perfect for keeping track of thoughts. Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible! Paid for annual membership and have zero membership functionality. Also invoiced twice so nearly £56 down and still cant add simple things like bullet points and to do check boxes. Really not happy and want my money back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excelent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Unique in many ways! 🥇"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Is a good app. Possible to embed photos next to text, like a thumbnail. Great that it's cross platform. edit: I have revised from 4 stars to three. The app no longer supports inline images which was a dealbreaker for me. Am shopping around for other alternatives now. Other features remain very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The perfect journaling app. I've gone through a lot but this one combines simplicity with innovation in an astounding way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome for keeping a video diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pleasantly surprised it was an impulse download.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am loving the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is THE new way to record your daily life. I have been using it everyday ever since I downloaded this app. I am so glad I found this app. Its very accessible because you have your phone/tablet on your hand so I record my thoughts whenever I feel like to. The only problem I have is that I cant seem to sync my google fit data to Journey. I usually walk for 30min and it doesnt show in Journey. Other than that, ITS AWESOME"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only thing that would make me give that 5th star would be if you added more moods and activities to the entries. Or maybe be able to edit and add in my own moods. Was using a different app that had better customization but switched because here I can add photos which i love!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've tried various journalling app and this is the one I found I reallly enjoy using. I have paid for the add ons and they really do add to the journal. Love the Coach and various topics use can choose to complete. Highly recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"08/2017I love the app so far . I think it's brilliant but I really really wish there was a voice note option 05/2020 there's a voicenote option 🥺 and so many journal prompts 🥺 and a journal coach??? BEST JOURNAL APP EVER"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi, I think the widget is not working for me. I am currently using Nova Launcher. Is there anything I can do?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is a glorified notepad that you can easily get for free elsewhere. I purchased this app to be able to do daily voice journals, only to find after purchasing an annual subscription that there is a more premium option for voice recordings. Very disappointing app on every level, as it bugs out quite often and is not intuitive. Not impressed and would not recommend. If you are going to charge customers to use a journal, at least make the extras part of the package. Joke."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity of this journal app and the way I can syncronize everything through Google account. Makes my life easier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall a great journaling app with all the perks of geotagging, wheather, tags, mood etc. The mac desktop version is better equipped than the android app, missing some of the formatting features, like the title tags that are important for me, being a blogger. Some times you need to sync a couple of times to get all the entries from desktop app. I would still recommend certainly for anyone wanting to spice up their daily journaling habit with pics also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app but didn't realize subscription based cannot just purchase the app. Free trial for seven days then billed annually."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My journey is my secret place!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for lifetime. It's worthless. Very limited. Asked for refund same day. Denied."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A+!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this strictly as a medical diary for information to share with our doctors and it is so helpful. You don't have to try and remember little things that we have found to be so important to the treatment of my spouse."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please refund my subscription fee! I requested a simple monthly expenses tracker which you guys could'nt provide so far. Very disappointed ☹️!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love Journey and I would recommend this to anyone wanting a clear journal experience on the go or to those who prefer to digitally document. That said, I just wish that part from Zapier integrations, the team would also link IFTTT as the former is too pricey for individuals while the latter is free and convenient for individuals who primarily use Journey for their personal use. That is where currently, Day One scores over Journey at the moment. I hope the team brings IFTTT integration soon!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. Being a free user, the features they provide are more than enough for me. Best thing about this app is it's fast cloud sync. I'm able to access everything on my desktop browser. Love it.😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the App so much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is very good. It would be great if 1)User is having an option to select only the options he needed in the Today Screen. 2) Exported journal entries can be improved, because now if we export even if there are 20 entries of 100 words the generated pdf is 20 pages ,which can be shown only in 2-3 pages."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have only recently downloaded this app but I have already got into the habit of using it every day. It is very easy to use and I enjoy writing down daily events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gyu"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beeng using it for 2 yrs now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's alright and takes care of everything in a way that I like. The easy GDrive pdf backup integration is great if I ever need to migrate to a new platform in the future and gives me peace of mind. It functions significantly better than when I first started my Journey. I've been using it on and off since 2017, and I'm pleasantly surprised at the progress and updates every few months. While it's not 5 stars yet, I'm optimistic that I'll be adding their final fifth star in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the ease it is to write my thoughts & know that they are saved for me to look back on later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app for journaling. It has a good user interface and thankfully there aren't any third party ads. But it's a little tiring how insistent the app is about getting you to buy the premium version. There's a full screen pop up ad for the premium version every single time you use the app. I understand you want more paying customers, and I'm certainly not a mobile advertising expert, but this tactic is a bit annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this!! The only thing the nocks of a star is the limit of 4 pictures 😔other than that this is the best journal I've tried!! (I tried two others first and didn't like them)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have paid and subscribed for a year but that doesn't show up on my app. The payment is confirmed and the subscription shows up on my play store but not on the app. How can this be fixed ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Google's Jorney is the big brother of Idea. If you are familar with the one, you will have no trouble moving into Jorney. Even if you have never oppened Idea, Journey is intuitive. I have a Google Chrome book and tablet. I also have a BlackBerry smartphone which has an android operating system . Journey works flawlessly on all three. I can write on one and read what I wrote on the others. Talk about your portability! In spades."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you don't journal daily you are missing out. Journaling helps you direct your life and is the foundation for successful days, weeks, months, quarters, years, and a life well lived. Journey helps you get there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I accidentally tapped on the premium-only stuffs while typing and an add popped up. When i close it the app didn't save any of my typing. Also there are too many adds that sometimes pop up right after i close one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how simple the app is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app very simple. Basically a diary on your phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just found out I can vlog. I'm very excited about this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was an early user of Journey as I tend to try most journaling apps to find one that I'll actually use. It was great from the start but it's consistently being improved in thoughtful ways that don't detract from the whole point of the app. I genuinely cannot see using anything else. No kidding."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful for daily journal. Accessible from web browser also. Windows app is useless. It gives only two options - purchase full version or exit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"GreAt app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Downloaded the app for the first time in a year. Was offered a free trial for 7 days which I accepted, however, they've charged my card anyway and on the support chat there is only a bot which is completely unhelpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and satisfactory experience so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just got into it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this app. But the problem now is, I am unable to restore upgrade on my new phone. Please resolve the issue as it hurts to give less than 5 stars to one of my favourite apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journaling app ever. You are able to add quick notes at any time. You are able to add address,dates,weather, photos,and times, this is a very good app and the cost is well worth being able to store all my stiff. Thank you for this wonderful app could not live with out it and have shared it with many of my friends Do you have a referral program?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Kept a handwritten journal for years and fell out of writing.... this has been the perfect thing to get me going again. Bought the subscription almost immediately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Decent app, well detailed, and easy to write on. I had no problems besides the fact that almost EVERYTHING requires a paid membership. I just wanted something to write a journal in, not to waste money on a dumb subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Straight forward and very easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is getting on my nerves. You sign in then it tells you about trial period, paid app after. The app now has my email and name. And whatever else. How do i delete my email and name off the app before I uninstall??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First time journaler, this is an excellent app on the Note 10. I haven't tried desk top version and probs won't. This has made my journalling experience so much easier than I thought it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Subscription app not revealed until after download. Trust vanquished from the beginning. Might be a pretty nice app. Not interested now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, very usefull, you have text input, audio input, video input, pictures, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, simple to use and the design is pleasing to the eye"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"this app seems very well made. however, it's way too over complicated. does a million different things but I was only looking for one thing: a gratitude journal. I found the ""presently"" app and like that much more. it's simple and focused and the UI is not overwhelmingly busy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it! But please fix video bug. Everytime I record lately usually 9 min videos, they get deleted when I try to upload them and then I have to start over! I'm going to use a different app in the meantime I guess because I really need to upload video diaries its my way of coping."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I get to vent with passcode security. Simple but nothing better to my mind and soul"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really really love this app. Thank you for making it for us."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Best diary app I've used..........well on android anyway.i also used the windows app best since i changed laptops recently the windows app wants me to pay or i cant use it.i already pay for the android version but don't know why i suddenly need to pay to use windows app.works out expensive to use cross platform. Edit, I you want android only this app is brilliant 25 pound to renew next year,very expensive one year in and and still £25 to renew for next 12 month seems expensive,the interface on windows is the ugliest UI i've ever seen since DOS, wish i could could export all my entries to a different app but seems that can't be done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super helpful and useful especially during this time. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"❌ Many thing are useless and Not Free ❌........ ❌ Too many ADs ... ADs ... ADs ❌ ... Here , There , All Over very BAD 🔥 ... Deleted .... 🔥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Installed after reading the reviews and checking out your website where you listed templates that I'm interested in. Am still on your 7 day free trial but already paid for lifetime membership after trying out a couple of entries and liked it so you know I'm serious. I must say I'm disappointed, would have given 5 stars but have not been able to find out install the template. Only found your 5 free templates online?? But can't figure out how to import it on my Android??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient to make important notes and maintain a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy and secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I did not even try this, App developer should include the information about free trials and billing in app details."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like having my journal on hand all the time. It's easy to use and I can save my work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been great with helping me work through things and get my thoughts out of me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Easy to use and great that I can include pics in my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service. Bad search feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app since 2018, its very nice and saves my entry on other devices :) would recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👌 This app helps to keep me on task and focused."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the very thing I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App I never thought I'd be using something like this, but it's definitely helpful in bringing peace to mind. Nice interface and definitely glad I decided to give it a try."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Inspiring journal, prompts me out of lazy habits, many features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice, polished UI. Needs some improvements for when offline (at least a message like ""please connect to the internet"", instead of empty list). I'd love it if it had some templates to help me fill in stuff in certain shapes, then allow me to customise the templates. Also, if I could set up multiple reminders for the day that would be awesome - I use a different app that reminds me to get up and stretch (ashamed I need that...)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love keeping my journal on digital now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! So very helpful. I would love it if the tags were easier to edit and search though. If you could select more than one tag to narrow the search down, that'd be awesome. Still, I really like it. It's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can you please put finger print because my little brothers know all my passwords a d I will only need to use my finger and there's will not work please."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still new"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love the app. The price is fair and I love that it is cross-platform. I miss the feature from DayOne where you can have separate notebooks depending the area of your life where you are Journaling about."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Probably wouldn't journal if not for this app. Haven't needed to go pay version yet but looks decently priced"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Me encanta poder colocar imágenes. Mi escritura, y me encanta lo sencillo que es de utilizar. ....y que lo puedo compartir o imprimir"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I started using it in November. I always wonderes if I fill up too many diaries there wont be space, therell be too many. So id use real life diaries only when i really feel in a writing mood, but use Journey too to save space!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tried the premium and normal and always happy. Used this for years and its the best way to organize my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: I said I would give you five stars if you made it possible to put video and pics in the same entry. You did. Thank you. Here is your additional star. 😁 I must have really liked this app when I used it the first time around because I spent days hunting it down after forgetting what it was called. It allows me to do everything I want in a journal--picw, writing, drawing, etc. I only wish you could save video in pics in the same entry. Figure that out, and I will gladly give 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I likenthat every now and then i get a notification asking how im doing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is good for writing stuff and having attachments added to the Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Sometimes I have a hard time with thinking about what I want to write, so I like that they have prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent Journal app. Probably worth the upgrade. Upgrade pushed a bit much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! I use it regularly. Very nice app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've never been great at journaling bit areas have wanted to. This app has made it easy to quickly write a few thoughts each day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good only been using a few days but does all I need it too. Able to put in in multiple detailed notes on the calendar which helps me in my work immensely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is what I use and reccomend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good jornal app with cloud sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I love how you can use on both the computer and the phone. Lots of features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Satisfying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to be able to journal when I want/can"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good, one the best on market place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is truly amazing! I will be using this app for a long time to journal my feelings. I have been using it for a week and love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I prefer to keep a journal with pen and paper; however, I will frequently mess up my wording, spelling, and a few other things (on occasion), so I enjoy using this app to help me plan what I want to say ahead of time. Also, I have nosy family members that prevent me from writing openly in my journal; so this app is incredibly useful in protecting my privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Best workout journal! I have detracted a star because the app keeps telling me to review it after I've reviewed it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to help you record memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app has a strong pay wall with a bad marketing and even worse optimization. Text related app which had no text formating integrated and now when they added it is not working in Chrome browser and is half-hidden in Android version (bad positioning). Do they even test things before release? I say NO to these developers and their marketing manager. Not worth Google choice not worth the money I paid them to be able to save my posts on device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like how I can tag my entries. I do not like all the pop ups for premium. Please cut down the promos or I'll look for another app. Update: I kind of chuckled when I read the response to my review. Don't force me to pay for something if the free version is insufficient. Lure me with a great free version, then entice me to get an upgrade. Maybe the app creators will realize a better business strategy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everyone should journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Nice aesthetics."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just absolutely love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for journal writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Really pushy witn the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Editing my review because I've just realised that when you add images into your entries they're not actually saved anywhere, it's just like a thumbnail view of the image saved on your phone, so if you take the image off your phone, it's no longer in your entry. What's the point of adding images at all? Really good app for little journal entries. I've got the free option and so far don't see any need to upgrade, other than to get rid of the ads for an upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Truly the best, have been using it for 6 months. The customer service is superb! They answered me after 5 minutes of asking. There are few improvements that I think would improve the journaling experience greatly: - Automatic Favorite Places; so you don't have to write places again if you don't want to use the Google Map."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I liked the app but the annnoying thing about it that it keeps telling me to subscribe each time i open it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Free for 7 days then £29/or. Misleading app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, nice UI but there are some bugs and not a varity of misc functions like other Journey type apps. Also i've purchased the Premium licence and I can't use the addons unfortunately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All American speakers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I honestly love this app. It's much better than Day One as it lets you store more than one pic a day for free and even syncs which is amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's been pretty good the past 2 days I've used it. It doesn't comply with GDPR though as you have to pay to be able to export your data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"These guys are fraud. Debited my iTunes account twice for the same purchase. Mailed them several times. Didn't refund the money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for quick daily thoughts and keeping track of events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for journaling and tracking moods, health issues, just about anything!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I dig the notifications. It helps me to get more stuff out as it's happening. I really like this app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love how this has helped me start writing again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gives what it promises. Like it sooo much. Simple yet answers my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for a while now and it's great, I love using tags, it makes it easy to sort entries. I was searching for a substitute for manual diary and since I started using this app I started writing diary more often. Also I think it's well protected so no one can accidentally see some of your posts since the app locks itself immediately after you finish the entry. I recommend it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is an amazing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A delightfully relaxed app. Most journal apps function exclusively as notepads. This app in particular functions as a hub of multiple journal styles. Self-improvement, writing techniques, or observations. The app offers prompts and questions to help get you started, with most being free and others being locked behind a surprisingly affordable pay wall. Overall a very pleasant app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use private with plenty of room to be creative. Great journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall I like it. But adding photos on android can be inconvenient. Only recent photos are available while older have to added from files. And only one photo can be added like that. Moreover, photos can't be opened in full screen. If this gets fixed, solid 5 stars. Many options to edit your journal entries like map location, mood, photos, audio etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app. Simple, to the right point, to keep a daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this every time I sort out the thoughts in my head"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's only been 4 days but I enjoy this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm using this app to help with anxiety and track some health symptoms"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so good ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hello, I am using this journey from 2016. But i have one question. As i have stored alot of emails and their passwords. So i am confusing that Do you people check these personals details of users in journey account? Like how can i trust you people? Tell me with details here. If you can satisfy me i can give you 5 stars and also good reviews. Waiting for your response. After checking your response, i give you 5 stars now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journey. One of the Bests."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Editing: thanks to ellie for solving my problem. If any one having a problem in 'coach' function, turn your devices' default language and try it again.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it as it is good to write down your thoughts everyday instead of in a book, as you are always on your phone. Not only that but it comes with other helpful features as well like you mood, excersize, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, like the privacy as well with password option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal Ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent, straightforward, reliable journaling app. The online version is also very cool and offers more options. It has all the features I need. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thought provoking and helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal entry made easy. Tried a lot of apps but loved this one. User friendly, simple yet effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good journaling software, and the reminders to write are great. Really wish I could set the security timeout to any value, and not just the ones that are selectable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love everything about this app except for the fact that I need to pay for something on each device. I was extremely disappointed that I purchased a subscription on my iPhone which I promptly returned a month later and then when I got my pixel I wasn't able to use this app without paying again. To this day I still don't know what I have paid subscriptions for and what I don't since there's another computer option. It should be by login not device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Quite good...but could be better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I paid for annual membership after 2 days of using the app. I tried other apps previously but always failed to stick to a routine. I really appreciate the coach feature (morning journal) as it helps me create an intention at the start of the day, which continues to motivate me throughout the day. It's also easy to use, has a simple and clean interface. The desktop app is also well updated which is very convenient. But mostly i love the coach feature, hope there will be more guides in future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If i buy premium, can i use premium app on two devices using one gamil account without buying twice ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good , I love it. Back up is not possible unless you are a paid user , I lost a lots of good memories and notes due to no back up option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like how easy it is to use and especially the hints and reminders. I need both!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried to keep a journal for years, but after a week or so I would lose interest It sounds silly but paying to journal holds my feet to the fire and keeps me accountable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect Journaling app, cannot imagine it getting any better. The go to app for personal diaries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Fabulous. Minor annoyance of always suggesting I buy the premium version, but worth those for the quality of the app. Love the photo and maps feature!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helpful for noting fillings, emotions, thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The best life changing journal on the market! Been using it for 2 years and it just gets better and better. Only 1 complaint though... They keep charging me to use it on different devices. I feel like I paid 5 times already."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have a request to creators, kindly enable hand writing mode , it would be very pleasent experience ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me organise all of my thoughts and memories. Cheers for such a simple but powerful app. I have one suggestion though, Can each of the story have a heading? It shows the datetime right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! I have needed to keep a journal for legal reasons since jan 2020 and this has helped me to stay on top of that. Super simple to write in and the reminders are helpful. I really enjoy the ease of access into the app to create a new journal entry and am happy with it. It has everything you need and nothing you dont. Enjoy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the only journal you will ever need. Add pics, audios, choose themes, and view throwbacks. And much more. 💜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome is the Journey time spent in words share yours with this wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app with simple, yet powerful tools. I have 3+ years worth stuff on it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal app! One of the best that filled with every function you would expect. Would still wish for cross-platform versions (iOS, PC, ...)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. No issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After using this app for close to 2 years, I'm proud to say, ""No other journalling app will do."" 💝 This is a true gift to me. I love the simple, uncluttered user interface. I LOVE that I can add pictures, audio and other attachments. Lately I've felt lazy to write in my hardcover journal,so I searched meticulously for the perfect, minimalistic journalling app that was easy on the eyes and could be a suitable substitute. It has helped me through some of the best and roughest times since. I💝 it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been great so far. So easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been a user for so many years and I really love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I just downloaded the app to see if I would like it, and of course I see that after 7 days you have to start paying. Why is it that a lot of these apps pop up as free when I type in, ""free journal app"", but once you are on the page it shows that you only get 7 days free. How is that even legal? To me that is like false advertisement. When something is free, it's free. If you have to pay then it isn't free!! Make it noted in the install area that it's only ""free"" for a certain number of days."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I haven't used all of the features of this app, in the use I have, none have been unpredictable and have only been user friendly. So much that can be done that I wish I had time to explore them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like being able to write my thoughts down anytime I want, or even just speak them and it appears on my screen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Opened app, forced a login to actually see the price then had 60 seconds to decide on a one time offer begore I had even checked out what the app had to offer. Total disgrace of an app, so not care how good it is that is shady business practices. Edited. Developer responded a clearly standard response which ignores everything I said in review"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm giving 4 stars due to the aggresive ads, otherwise a really nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and powerful, pretty useful for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"🔴"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app needed this years ago will be using every day ♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app! It does lag a little. There is a feture that I wish was free because some people can't handle the bright light, which is dark mode. You shouldn't have to have a premium or whatever for it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't get enough of the app. It's good because it's available even if you lose the phone. Good Job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app helps me think through my thoughts. I can't really talk about my problems but i can still get em down and outta my head. Its nice. Just wish the ads were less frequent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful diary app! Love that i can log in and write on my phone or computer and it all syncs together"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like using this app to write down my feelings it makes it easier to go over them when I meet with my therapist"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Had trouble getting my entries back. I love the app before and was considering to buy premium, but no. There were chunks of entries missing. Uninstalled for good. Edit: That's the problem, I used the cloud, and chunks of entries within the two years of my use were missing. Disappointing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app keeping millions of Journey users and create a healthier, happier mind. A sanctuary for your mind and soul, Journey will help increase your positive energy, be more grateful and a calmer mind by building healthy thinkings through journaling.

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it it's great n for someone with bpd it great. I love this app and still let's me use until have have funds to pay x"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I never used it, and got billed for the next year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a diary/ journal. Best I've found been using it for nearly three years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey!! It is a diary, a record of your thoughts, location, fitness workout and so much more. I design beaded jewelry and I use Journey as a record of inventory, the work accomplished for each day, a record of sales and a picture of each piece I designed. This is an amazing app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the password protection 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app there's not many ads and easy to use this helps me a lot. This is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's quite good ! Just if there was a trash folder if by mistake we delete a notes we can restore it, Hope u put that feature!, And there are alot of cool feature but iit's not free ,try to make some free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary journal ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It say its free with ads untill you sign up what bs! Suffering from depression trying to find something that doesnt suck the money out of you. Thought people wanted to help each other but when mental health syle apps coast its apparent my bad mental state is a way for others to make money. It was on my phone long enuff to write this now being deleted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I had made a poor review BUT Developer got back to me and corrected a issue i had. I would highly recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Seemed a good idea at the time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"need more meaningful fuction …like a tracking something"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great cross platform to record your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app easy to use and very appealing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"When you buy lifetime purchase you should be ready, that after some time the app will bring something different on the scene but for additional cost. That is the reason of 4/5 In every other aspect - great application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"🌞"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good. But, I noticed that since I have been on YouTube. This journal seems to have access to my username from that site. I became concerned about privacy. Also it is supposed to lock after use however when I open previous tabs it opens to my previous entry with no pin or print required, again making me wonder about privacy as well as security. Sadly, I've had to uninstall it because of this. A very good app otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app! I like the coaching aspect. It makes me what to write"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Update: I uninstalled and then went to Playstore to search for it again and reinstalled it. It is a free version . Thanks to developer for clarification about membership. More feature-rich than what I was looking for. I did try entering in the journal part and the font size was a bit on small side. Changed it from medium to large. There are a half dozen font styles to choose from."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever, and I've tried a lot of them. Very easy to use, nice interface, lots of details you can add. I especially love how I can add pictures so I can include them in writing about my day. A+!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really amazing.. Using it from past 3.5yrs.. I never miss writing the journal a single day. It helps me to capture and save all the lovely moments thru words, video and pics.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I adore this app absolutely love it I know I will have to use it for a few more years to get the full review down but for now I'm in love it does everything it said it would without paying for anything. Record things daily it amazing I highly recommend!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good interactive app. Been able to journal for a few days now and hoping to continue"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, really helpful to keep with journaling. Would be nice to add more than one photo to a day, but minor gripe. 2020 update - still a great experience. Would love Google Photos integration!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Delightful journal app that makes keeping a journal easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Get it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has transformed my life, I was depressed almost a year ago, with no purpose. I felt alone but then I decided to implement self growth, and journaling. Journey is the perfect place to journal and makes it easy to feel accomplished. I love this app. I can't sleep without writing in it. Definitely reccomend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Quite happy with all the options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've really enjoyed using this app. Love the prompts and reading the throwback entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"🌞"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My life has become much richer as a result of beginning to maintain a daily journal, and this app has provided a great framework to help me get started."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app for my daily journaling experience. It has a daily reminder that goes right into my email that I can respond directly from my email. You can attach any type of document along with your log. Many different fonts and colors to choose from. It simply a beautiful app to use. Oh and you can use across my platforms. I synced mine with my Pc with no problem. It has mood notifications you can log each day along with GPS coordinations. This app is very simple and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Essy to use e-journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"THE APP IS NOT FREE, $15 YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION also if you want to try using the ""free"" version good luck, I could not find any features that didn't bring me back to some prompt about paying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this every day. Very reliabel and works well. Nice that you can add a picture of your location. Recommend this for anyone looking for a daily jourrnal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I purchased premium account. I wish there will be a quote page like Grid diary app. It means a lot. Motivate myself everytime I open the app :). It would be great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. Once template features are added to android I will purchase premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, i just simply love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not the app I was looking for. Not saying it's not good, not what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"What's the point of there being a passcode option if it doesn't even work? I closed out, locked my phone, came back, opened the app, and it didn't ask for my passcode. It just opened right up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not that good will interrupt me as I'm typing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app for keeping records"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I don't like the fact that I have to pay for it monthly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy with a nice design. However I cannot easily add attachments from various sources - pics are not easily obtained eg frome Google photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not so sure the app sucks but it kids tricky when they poke your eyes with their trails and in app memberships that simply aren't worth the money or effort. There are way cooler and more fun creative apps that are free that I would spent my money on . Oh and be careful not to install/ purchase app using an account different Google accounts with the same credit debit cards you might be charged for them both separately. There should be a way to integrate both especially if you the same person or"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Make it free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, multi platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I love the prompts from the coach that get me going when I don't just want to write about what happened today. I love thinking how I'll be able to jump back to dates in months or years to remember what this time was like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty good - like ""MATCH"" to what anyone would have as your own personal private journal. Best part is that you don't have to search for a pen to write/jot down when it's all on your phone not just only that though mostly like a scrapbook - all including: pictures can add pictures, location, weather, emotions, what you're doing... Etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Look no further. Spring for the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not paying that much to use this, lower the price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm sure there is more to this app than I am currently utilizing. I have not fully jumped into it. However one day soon I will sit down and mess around with it. I did accept the offer to GoPro for life so I'm interested in seeing what all this can do. So far I'm really enjoying the prompts and I do like the format"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me during this time. From the reminders to get my thoughts out of my head and written down to asking me questions that help me process my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for this App in 2015, for ""lifetime premium"". All of the previously promised functionalities has been removed for new cloud based cross platform functionality. NOW. IN 2020. All of my journal entries feel like it is being held hostage unless I contribute more money for their updated ""membership"". So much for ""lifetime premium"". I feel betrayed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gajab"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love the secure journal to vent and say what's on my mind! No one can access without my fingerprint"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderfull app, it helps me to make myself inspired and keeping track whats going on in my life. I Just upgraded to lifetime premium on deal, totally worth it. Thanks guys, keep it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Always wanted to be a diary taker, but never could make myself stick with it. My favorite feature is that I can, in lieu of writing anything, record 10 minutes of me ranting about my day, and save that as an entry instead."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Saves me time and allows me to capture important moments with pictures and videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app app for prompting journalling and gratitude. Just a little unclear on how to use it.. that's why the 4 star"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write everyday because of this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. Minimalistic design"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've had this journal for years and love it. You do have to pay for some of the bonus things but it's worth it either way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why is something as simple as dark mode behind a pay wall?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Costly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if it gave you reminders everyday to write in your Journal. But other than that it's good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, when I remember to journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journalling ap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actully really enjoy the app layout, typing modes, and the over all simplicity of the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved having a virtual book to write in all my reminanced notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the fact that this app allows me to say whatever I want real clear that picks up everything I say ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, very simple interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it since 2017, it really helps especially to understand how you're growing as a person."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm confused, why can't I share on multiple devices without premium? What is the difference between premium and non-paid? It felt like I HAD TO pay for premium to use this app at all??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent..the best diary i ever had."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth it. I buy the premium plan to support the developer. Thank you for making this awesome app. Kudos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have spent 1751 days with this app since July 21, 2015. I think five of years of time is enough time to actually tell whether an app delivers what it promises. I am here to tell you that it does and ever since I have installed Journey , it has been my journal whenever I was unable to to write in my real journal. Even if you lose your phone you needn't worry about losing anything. Journey syncs your data and saves it in the cloud so you never lose anything. Thank you, Journey! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good.. And easy to use. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and fun to use. Love the prompts and reminders. Photos and video attachments are great. Love that it notes time, location , weather. Definitely not a waste of money!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for months now every single day and I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app help me keep track of life events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This is generally a well built and functional app. My main bug bear is that there are so many good coach programmes such as daily gratitude, inspirational quotes, self confidence building and creativity prompts. You can only use one at any one time and if you switch to a different programme, the counter resets to one. Some of these programs have 365 days of prompts. I would appreciate if this could be fixed, as it's devaluing the membership cost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Concise and well-crafted user interface which makes journaling a joy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app, clean interface, allows to add all possible attachments, tagging and export your journal entries. Really does all you would want from something like this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have never been so happy in my life for such a simple App that has Everything. I just want to journal. Guesstimate of 10min after free trial I paid for the yr already 🤞. I have trouble communicating and this way I can type, audio, video and place in the same group for the same thought that keeps running back.....I wish I had the written words to tell you how flipping awesome this is. Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!! 😍🥰😍👊👏🙏that is technically a high 5 but prayer hands are a bit relevant now too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app I had a very bad brain injury in 12,1998 and I need to retrain my brain for better life and this app is very helpful to me thanks to the people who made it and GOD bless you all"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent dairy app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"forever diary, forever favorite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love the security and personalization options. I like I can attach pictures to a post, perfect for going back to remembering good time t. My only suggestion is on the spot where you put what you are doing it only had a few options (stationary, walking, ....). Most times I'm sitting (riding in the car, on couch, in bed, maybe at a particular location) I wish I could distinguish between them by typing in what I'm doing myself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seems to be a good app so far. I am more inclined to use this and try to hand write in a diary (terrible hand writing these days!)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I got in, it immediately offered me 50% off, and i bought it (regretfully). Then i started audio recording. And it showed that the audio is saved to my partner's gmail account which was also logged on in my phone. Where is the privacy? Please refund!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I installed this app only for the video function which doesnt work! When I record a video thru the paperclip attachment, thete is no option to upload! It just disappears when I close the video. Disappointing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using the app for a few days now and have enjoyed it for the most part. However, today was the first and last time I use the coaching feature. I waisted one hour of my time journaling only to have everything deleted right in the middle of typing. I thought that perhaps my entry was backed up as I was typing, but no such luck. Disappointing 😞."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super simple ...cross platform ..no excuse not to write.. glad i chose Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The thought of keeping as journal is good, but at the same time it requires lot of thinking for the kind of journal, the security and privacy. I think this app solves all the other aspects so you just have to log your journey and leave rest of the worries aside."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for self reflection and developing healthy habits such as gratitude!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the interface of this app and it's very easy to use! The minimal design makes me excited to journal since it's not overly cluttered. I would just prefer if the app let you add multiple dates for your entries nstead of just one because sometimes I work on one entry more than one day. But I really love this app. Keep up the great work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for journaling. I've actually started writing in my journal several times a day again!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice & usefull"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please consider making the insertion of images within the text available instead of only at the top of an entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No reply on support. Have to pay a subscription to back up entries. Will update my review if and when I get a reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journalling/note-taking app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tried several journaling apps and this was dedinitely the best one, with all the features I was looking for as well as being aesthetically pleasing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this app for about a week. Ive actually been doing it every day, evwn adding pictures but only time will tell if I stick with it. I have a physical journal that I only write in when I remeber to. Not that often. So hopefully with the icon with a number notification. It will continue to keep me on track. Pretty good ap in my opinion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi! To the developers of this app, thank you. This was an instrument for me to release my emotions and it really helped my organize my thoughts and overall, my mental health. Thank you!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I initially reviewed this application in July 2018. Happy to say that I am still using and enjoying it in December 2019. More than meets my needs. 👍 Great app very user friendly. Meets my needs. May 2020 and still using this app. These days have made it more important to journal. Still a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Asking for payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I picked this app because I heard it was a good cross platform app. However, the web version is not usable for me (low contrast + small text = severe eye strain) and the PC app seems to be membership-only (although this isn't explicitly stated anywhere, so I found out by trying to install it). I will try out a membership for a bit, but I'm disappointed I have to pay extra for accessibility that should have been built in by default."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great simple to use app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"കൂൾ"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use and sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the idea but very glitchy. It prompted me in the morning via notification but after I click on the notification it shows me the prompt then immediately exits the app. It will not let me move forward in progress and no dashboard if you enter app through the notification. Still testing it out via clicking on the app itself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my favorite and go to apps. Been using journey since 2014. It's simple and user-friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great app for capturing thoughts. I like the feature to attach a video instead of having to write everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good but if I pay for something I don't want to get hit with . Rate my app every other time I open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quite a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Splendid! Splendid!! Splendid!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's a great app, but please stop spamming me with the ""get paid membership"" app. im broke lmao"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Even the free app is good enough! Everyone should download this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it the interface is user friendly keeps the data well organised"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works as advertised which is more than can be hoped for other apps. Helped me through difficult times. You don't actually need to pay at all if you just want to journal. Good app worth having."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely interface accross all devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"When I opened the app for the first time, instead of taking me to a page that was useful, it wanted to step through a bunch of screens that were about how it could get its hooks into me. At 7:13am the very next morning, it pinged my phone with a loud notification asking me if I would like to become a member."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Multiple bugs after purchase. I'm disappointed. Started to use trial version, decided to switch to full after a few weeks of usage. Although I bought a lifetime premium I still don't have access to add-ons in the app, the web version is very poor: it has only the time line and calendar, atlas, etc. Not all entries were synced and they are not in chronological order on the website. Cannot swipe attached photos in full screen. Cannot see pictures pasted into the entry in the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am just using the journal as a diary to have a private vent!! But, I try to add positive comments and photos of my days too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nicely curated app for anyone spending a lot of time on a digital screen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Why do you always have to pay a subscription for these things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The free version is very responsive. Though limited in features still I was able to enjoy it. What more if it's upgraded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I caan write out all of my thoughts nd feeling. I lve the caching feature that helps me not only journel better but help me plan and srt out my thoughts. This app has so many features, like the reminder to do my journal for the day, and I can go back and read over what I have written and see my progression. Also, you an add photos, whic I truly love using when I travel. I much rather use this wonderful app over putting my life out in social media for the world."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good. All the essentials are free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's so convenient because it is Cross platform!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app has too many features for a daily journal—all the little buttons and everything actually serve to discourage me from journalling. Furthermore, almost none of this is free, even after paying for the ""lifetime"" license. Oh, sure, that gives me a dark theme and a few other nice things, but most of Journey's premium features are not unlocked with that one-time purchase; instead, they want me to pay a monthly subscription. I'd rather just journal in Google Docs, thank you very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I upgraded to the premium version and it was well worth it! I love the coaching features with journal prompts and how customizable everything is. I'm using it for my mental health so that I have a record of journal entries to show when I start therapy. Journey is really helping me with self-expression, creativity, and with self-discovery. I highly recommend this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for years! Simple yet effective setup makes it a fantastic journal/diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👌👌👌👌👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Easy and always ready. To record memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Fake"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased Lifetime Premium at first but it was only to unlock some features. Then few days after I was charged automatically for USD30 for only 1 year membership. When I sent enquiries to ask about the charges, their billing team was not willing to help and answered my doubts only after I had resent the emails for 2 times in 3 weeks. I will not recommend this app due to confusing and unreasonable charges and also the poor attitude for treating customers' enquiries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that it backs up journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I dont like the fact that u have to pay for a DIARY..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Thirty quid a year? Sod that, a single developer doing 10 mins a week could probably make a similar app easily enough, that gives me an idea..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Some features should be available for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It doesn't have any client side encryption. It is really important for such app to have that option. Yes, our data is encrypted in google but still google has access to it and also if someone could get into our account it will have all data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm happy to have it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Have to pay $2.49 per month for dark mode. Always write my current journal in Google docs at night, so having a dark background is a 100% necessity. App might be good, but I will not start using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great & amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I appreciate having somewhere other than social media to store my memories and photos. And I like the features that auto-record or let you select date, weather, location, etc. Works well. Would be even better if the layout could include a little more of a formatted or finished look and entries could eventually be transferred or transformed into a printable book."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"versitile and easy to use across android platforms. Lots of addons (Many free) to get creative Juices flowing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a simple journalling app that has everything I want. It is uncluttered and it does not get in the way of the writing. Yet you can post a picture(s) and record your mood. I have tried a few journalling apps, but this is my favourite."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying the app so far if any discrepancies happen to arise at all I will update this entry... thank you ... 💋 Shannon"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app, it's subtle so doesn't take over your life, just gentle reminders to make entries, some if them are guided by a coach you can choose from a specific program. No problems so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great...only wish I could do more activity's without upgrading to premium..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to record your life journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I wanted in a journal app, minus the monthly subscription, but I understand they need continuous income if I want it to be continuously improved, so I'm okay with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Liked it. So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app! I used this for my daily journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I think this will be a great app, but I can't get it to recognize my subscription. I have deleted and reinstalled but it still will not show up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, super simple, love the fact I can use the app on the go and the website when at the computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy this app. Don't usually write reviews but this one is worth recommending. Does all I need and much more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps me busy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its great. You can set a pin, save images and texts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Does exactly what I want - records text and backs it up to Google Drive. I don't need much of anything else. The odd picture included perhaps, but as is it suits me fine :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's very nice journaling app. Can you add some cursive fonts to make it more real?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the convenience, seamless of integration between my phone and pc plus the lightness of it all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great place to deposit your thoughts and it's transferable so if you switch phones you can retrieve it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only a 7 day free trial. I know I would need a longer trial to confirm if I want to pay a yearly subscription fee. Maybe push the trial out to a month?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great! Love the layout"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well made! User friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for about a month and I find it easy and intuitive. UPDATE: Two years later, I'm still using the app and finding it more useful than ever. I've give through three phones in this time and Journey is one of the apps that gets installed on Day One so I can make my diary posts about what's going on in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super helpful to relax and destress. I have solved anger issues with this app and its helped with depression I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good experience but 4 stars bcoz i think if the UI would more simple, smooth, responsive and more features included that would be more that enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is by far the best journaling app I've ever downloaded. Thank you. I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer 8 years ago and wish I had this app 3 years ago. I had a running blog, which 8 think I'm going to copy and paste into this app. I was just discharged from the hospital last week with a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer in my L2 vertebra. I'm keeping a journal of my life. Thank you so much. This app will make a difference in my life, my family's life and my reiki life. Jennifer B"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautifully designed with a lot of features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been very handy for journaling 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this app on Windows, Mac, and my Pixel. I absolutely love. But with the pixel 4, Google added face unlock. It's been almost a year and face biometrics hasn't been added. Please please please add it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! I got lots of fun using it. Though I hope the Lifetime Premium could cover all features, even with higher price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has let me find my rusty Journaling passion. I've tried other options such as Journal or the old school handwritten notebooks but the reasons of this app and the ability to link it to my computer makes it for easy entries. Love the Atlas function. I have only two suggestions to make it an enjoyable experience: make it so you can save both videos and pictures on each entry and the app always makes me update on windows 10 App every time I open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use google voice typing and adding an entry is so quick. I love recalling what has happened during the day. Remembering and celebrating every day is fin."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it and I like to organize all my journals and this app made that very easy and pleasing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very functional and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful to have a place in my phone to journal in the moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So, one thing which is bugging me is that the customer support is very bad for this app. The app does everything what you expect ir would. 5-stars for that. But when there is an issue, the customer service is so bad, it kills the joy of being a premium customer and paying for the app. I wish that they took the complaints and the issues seriously because the developers have made a 5-star worthy app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I found the app useful enough to purchase a lifetime premium on mobile but was disappointed to see that I could not even access Journey on my PC without purchasing another lifetime access license or an all-encompassing subscription (which I opted out of on my phone in the first place)... this seems a bit excessive to me. I would like to at least have access to Journey on my PC even if I can't enjoy the premium features I have on mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I downloaded this app a couple days ago, I've used lots of different journal apps trying to get into the habit for my mental health but I usually end up giving up after a few weeks. The layout of this app is easy to use and nice to look at, but nothing special. I am however very confused by all the different types of memberships and passes and one times payments there seem to be. I have no idea what the difference between any of them are, if any one could explain. Comes across as money hungry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app just hoped some features like the whole (italics bold underline) stuff were available without having to get premium. And the sync feature is great to sign into multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Cannot type anything on Android. Keyboard always disappear. And yes ads always pop up I don't have a problem with iOS version(paid). I also wanna link with Dropbox or Box cloud storage apps not just Google. I hate Google and Facebook products. Do something before I move back to Day One app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clear and concise journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Downloaded this last night and today got my first task of writing a letter to myself. I was doing great, after having written a lot, was close to saving it when the app crashed. I thought this was meant to help you, not make you frustrated. Very poorly designed app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.. Helps me remember my precious moments.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazingly wonderful Journaling app. I use it as a gratitude journal. Gratitude Journaling delivers financial abundance. I am a proud lifetime premium user of Journey. Thanks Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Having been introduced to Day One for Android as my first journalling app, I was apprehensive about making the switch. But I am very happy to have done so finally. Although Day One has a few more intuitively placed user controls, everything else is second-best compared to Journey. Hope you guys maintain this wonderful app during my lifetime. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great for keeping track of yourself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolute life saver. I thoroughly enjoy using the app. I got a lifetime premium plan and am satisfied and then some. This app has helped me channelise, record and get through some really testing times and immortalise some really good times. Easily one of my favourite mobile apps. EVER!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use Journaling app. It limits the number if daily pics to 3 and won't rotate the screen so you can have a wider keyboard. Overall is worth the cost to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ok but can't add a drawing or free handwriting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very therapeutic and the coaching is worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There should be facility to convert entry into pdf file"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Functional and intuitive - great journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Been using Journey for over a month as a Paid Annual Membership User. I haven't yet had the chance to really dive into ALL the details and features. Because I haven't yet taken FULL advantage of everything Journey provides I'm only giving a 3-Star Rating (Neutral) for now. By June I'll return and update my ratings and comments. My initial impressions so far from the 5 weeks of using the app (3+4 times a week) are that this is a very high quality developed app that just May get 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I became a lifetime premium member but there's a lot of features I can't use on the its web and even in the phone. Why? So disappointing for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is perfectly what I needed.I have a tendency to forget what I did,so this is to remind me and also, it is a great way of maintaining my memories in form of written matter along with pictures.Overall,very good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is what it is and does what it says.....Good app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is the best diary / journal app ever ♥️ Thank you so muuuch for creating this. Waiting for more features !! ♥️ I think you should add more activities it need more variety."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's an amazing app that helps me write everyday I've been using this for two straight years with premium and I'd like to share some feedback(more like personal inconveniences) 1. The location search dosen't work sometimes. I still don't know why this happens but it can happen for a long long time like for months so I have to pick the place and rename it 2. Premium only works on my phone Youtube premium works on any device so I think it's a bit ridiculous to buy premium for other devices as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. It helps me reflect and it gives me some validaty. Because it's documented."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling app. Easy to navigate though sometimes the menu bar would disappear and I have a hard time to bring it up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's okay but some features dont work vey well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app's great and easy to use with good look and feel. The downside is that when you try to create a new entry on a 'past' date, it always opens on the current day, which can be frustrating. But the mediocre rating here is not so much the app but the aftercare support and customer service - it's super bad. Just hope you don't get any issues because it's a nightmare trying to get the help or support you need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Was really pleased to see notes i made 4 years ago on another photo on the app once I installed it (after a pretty long time) on a new one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love having a journaling platform that I can type at instead of writing in a notebook. Its easier and convenient because I can pull up the app in either my phone or computer. It stores all my entries and backs up every keystroke! You can add pictures and moods. Its just the best one I have used and well worth the couple bucks you have to pay for the better version."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Likes the idea of keeping notes each day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just got my journal diary and i love the fact i can look back at my thoughts in these confusing times. So when i feel down i can read what i wrote or recorded text from when I was happy. It help me get a better understanding of me. Because thoughts fluctuate so much its good to have concrete thoughts that wont be forgotton."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too many ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to keep track of everything with photos and videos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal absolutely amazing. One little thing I noticed, in settings under misc, there is the option to have celcius and kilometers or fahrenheit and miles. Could there be a celcius and miles option for those who use metric units. Seems to be half and half for both metric and imperial?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey for over 2 years and love it. It is secure but still easily accessible. I can use a desktop or the app on my phone. Thank you for a secure, reliable and versatile Journaling app!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reliable .user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it! It's such a good app. Some of the interface could be a little more intuitive, especially relating to extra downloaded content. But, this app has me writing every day and I'm grateful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful and handy app for daily basis. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish I would have found this sooner."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have already purchased life time on my ipad, but why the system still recommended me some offer?"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nicely surprised"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"been using free version for a while now. decided to get the full version. very nice app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great one, yet to explore the features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this enough that I pay for a yearly members. I've been able to work through some pretty hard stuff because of just how available a journal is when it's on your phone. Sometimes I plug a keyboard into my phone and just rip for hours. I do wish that I could figure out how to type journal entries in landscape mode instead of portrait when I am using my usb keyboard though..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app! it really helps with keeping track of your days and journal entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Should be free as it's just a glorified notes app with some cloud storage. $30/year? Yikes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, only would need to ask for one more thing to be added...music.. please!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, simple and effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent Way To Track Your Life. Simple and has never failed me. I submit 1 entry a day and they are very neatly consolidated in the app. Useful search function too. My favourite part is the atlas view that shows where in the world you've spent your time, populating a map of the world with your diary entry photos. The daily prompt is a great feature remind you to reflect and capture your daily activity. I also enjoy the reminder feature which brings up things 30days/1year/2years ago etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having a place where I can write my feelings down. You can also post pictures, downloads or videos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app. It has reminders and allows for attachments. I need to be more consistent on my posts, so when I do have the time to fill in my journal, I enjoy it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best online journal app. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its really good app to use for journal or daily diary. I am facing an issue. Even after purchasing lifetime membership, it is asking me for upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app with confidence for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just wish it didn't cost so much. A great app for daily journal writing especially by email sync when it works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal apps that fit my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"After using this for a few days I am dropping my stars down. Cannot find a way to show next activity at the top of the list. Must scroll down to the bottom get to the next item chronologically listed. Why wouldn't the next agenda item be on top or at least have the option to organize first first and not last. Same with daily calendar entry items. The last time period is listed first. Defend the logic for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Son unos rateros ! Te ofrecen probar la versión premium por 7 días y uno pone los datos de la tarjeta. Cancele la subscripción por la app y en play store y me cobraron 1 año de suscripción! Ni siquiera un mes y ahora nadie responde por el dinero."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One amongst the best app for journaling . Lets you keep record of your mood, location, pictures, etc apart from your writings. Also, offers certain short courses on journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. I have been using it for about 6 years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can't italicise without having to be a member what .... Nah mate. Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Before you even open the app to see it you are blocked by a 1 time offer to buy subscription! Before seeing the app! Then deceptive tactics about trial 7 days but actually if you don't go into play store after 7 days to cancel it it auto renews. Even after uninstalling the app. Then get spammed on email about offer. Then get spammed by fake support bots on web version. Then having confusing on purpose subscriptions and plans that can run in parallel! Man.. you guys are greedy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app becisze I like to write a diary 😀 And sometimes I talk to my self and some times god"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"7 days free then you have to pay membership 🤣 no thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Simple and easy to use. It's what I've been looking for a long time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Where have you been all my life? Not sure how I didn't find this sooner, but now have - and love it! And the icing?? - most accurate speech to text app ever!! (cause I expect it's already using what Google has learnt about you, but I have a disability, so it makes it super fast and accurate to get details on a page). 🤩"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent xx"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is such an inspiring lovely app. It is beautifully designed and I use voice to text to get my thoughts down whether sad or inspiring. Really do like this app and appreciate having found it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have downloaded this app back in 2015 and then... I don't know what happened. But I re-downloaded it again after researching other diary apps. I like this the best so far. I appreciate the password access, simplicity, Google sync, and little things like automatic location track, mood, activity level. The only thing is that the location tracker is consistently off. I'm at home and every day it's giving me a different address. It's tedious to change manually so I just leave it there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite part is the throwback feature. Though I do wish there's an in-app cropping feature for the pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mantap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"♡ best place to vent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like like like!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm on my fourth day so far interesting interactive update later"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it. Works great. Has a code so no one can read it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Paid for it, then found you can't add images in with the text, the first image is displayed in the header of each post and subsequent images have to be swiped to view, videos don't play on the page either, a new window opens. It's very basic, it's cross platform, on the desktop version you can add images in with the text, alas only from a url and these images then display on the phone app as a broken link. You have to pay again to use the desktop app which is so basic it's not worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's one of the best apps that I have used. Eases up the effort to pen down the memories even while traveling. So many years have passed but the app continues to help me write and clear my mind. The memories being written and read are priceless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journey is pleasant to use and very useful. I just noticed probably a bug in the version for Android, because the counting of days with the couch are sometimes off (it tells me is the first when is actually the second one), and I had also some issues in updating an entry using the cloud version. I hope there will be more care of this small things, other than that I'll keep using it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it and its always got me writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Plain and simple journal writing app with everything you need. Love the prompts from the coach, I just wish I could set up the time at which they come up to make it earlier. I would also like the ability to make my own journal script templates, with different prompts for certain goals, tracking habits, and have my morning rituals jotted down, to name a few uses, since I find myself rewriting some prompts, like ""what I am grateful for"". Pasting from my personal notes is not that bad, but would like the app to give me this ability. I would also like the web app cloud version to work as the Lifetime Premium for android. Still, an awesome journal app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great wag to let loose with the stress of our current predicament!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not a free app, should be disclosed before install. Bite&switch"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I previously gave this app 5 stars. When I changed phones and re-opened the transferred app, I suddenly need to pay for a membership. What happened to the free option? It is not possible during the current covid-19 climate to find funds for this. Very disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal app I could find and I am so glad I did 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Was looking for something like this for so so long!! Journey is like my bucket of emosions. If I die sometime, I am sure am gonna live through this app. Hope all these write ups wont go vein."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps me track my thoughts and I love all the features it adds such moods and location."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very excited since 2015"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The more I use the more I like"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great journaling app. I use it everyday in the morning. It's really good when commuting to work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Excelent application, but I'd like to see faster development. Basically: - Multiple journal - for me the most important - Tagging of people (on photos, or only like some special tags) - Import from callendar - multiple gps possition per entry - some entry is about continuous walk - improve the web and windows app - not to important"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app for journaling my child's mile stones. I only have it a 3 start because I wish I could have more than one journal, so I can use one app to journal all of my children's memories. If they got that it would be the best app! Update: still only one journal per app. But my phone had broke and I thought I lost all of my children's memories, but they backed everything up. For that I am grateful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal app! I do the basic or free version. I use this app to mark down all of my child's mile stones. Once my phone broke, but luckily they have everything backed up, so I didn't lose any of her memories. So worth it! I would pay more if I could have more than one journal. So I could have one for each child. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, gives me reminders to write. I like the clean look. So far, so good!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent, easy to use and I intelligently designed program"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not being demanding, I am able to keep a log of whatever I fancy. Will be able to say more in days to come if required. I feel content with the experience so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app a lot. Cant wait to get the pro version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Alright I like the app, but I have a question!! I forgot my pass code and to change my pass code I had to uninstall the app and then install it again. Then I signed in with my Google account and the app was opened without asking a passcode. So this kind of concerns me about the personal security & privacy!! Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💞"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good spot to have a journey diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for around four years now, and my only complaint is that photos upload as attachments rather than as part of the entry. Otherwise it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the freedom of expression this app is so easy to use definately reccommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps, just satisfies what I have in mind.. Excellent! Still the best over these years.!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really like this app.. but i will not purchased any premiums coz its ok using it as free app.. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy method for journaling, dig being able to access from computer and phone, tagging is a great feature. Trying out the paid version for a year. Really love being reminded of past journal entries from a month ago and ability to search and export, and different text highlighting /formatting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, I will purchase full app when the covid is over."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Would you please add feature of adding links to this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You have to buy stuff that is money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Free. Please reduce the frequency of pop-up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Purchased lifetime premium. Premium features still not unlocked and restore purchase does nothing. I don't know where my money went"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Recommendations are clear"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, Very kind and Helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think anyone who wants to write what they feel that's going on in there life and they want to make sure it's private should try this app its great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use and no issues in 3+ yrs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app. Its my very personal space where I could express myself without any fear of being judged. Journey app is like my best friend. However, to benefit more from it I purchased premium membership today but still havent received confirmation. Payment was successful at my end, dont know what happened. I talked to an assistant from Google play, she asked to wait for 5 days. Is there anyone from Journal here who could help with the same?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like journey a lot it gives me a chance to express myself and be private, the only thing is I would've given it five stars but on some things you have to pay a monthly premium to use extra stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep a journal about our family life and activities, a treasure to look back on"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is good and easy to handle, I bought the premium when I was told I was able to upload photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am trying this app as I have adhd and really poor memory. I also love looking back but never had the self discipline or chill to sit and write. So I'm loving the video feature as I just make a quick update video. Talk nonsense at my future self about what's going on now, and am building a good little bank for the future me to look back at this me and the time we're all in with corona. Upgraded to lifetime and hoping this will be a great source of memory and interest for my future self and fam"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Too good.. Love it.. Easy to use also.. Fan,😘😍😍😍😃"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app. Very clean, and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Helps me to start journalling again. Interface is clean and crisp but still maintain its edgy features such as multimedia and fonts. Especially find tags feature very useful to categorize each journal. Only downside is bit more expensive. So far so good but not sure if I can keep up after one year due to cost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I seriously have to pay a company, just sobI can write my feelings? Not worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'v made lifetime membership purchase two days ago, but still blocks me enjoy the benefits.... 😑 Any solution ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really enjoy the app and the UI is beautiful. My only issue is that you can't flip the app sideways to type in landscape. For an app so focused on typing out long passages of text, it feels counter intuitive to not be able to orientate the keyboard into a better position for typing. Otherwise no complaints!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Includes basic journaling features, but nothing mind-blowing. Constant pop-ups and notifications about getting a subscription got irritating fast. On top of that, there are separate paid options for a recurring membership and ""lifetime premium"". No, thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years and absolutely love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean app. I've been using this since 2014, and recently got back to using it. There's a membership fee now. But it's very reasonable for the quality of this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It is a very good personal friend. I use it quite often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app does what it says it does."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it it's the best app ever when ever I need to type some thing down it always there for me to Express how I feel"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is fun and well made. It's a diary in your phone. What do you want to keep track of? Journey helps you do that. Write your daily emotions or your kid's growth or your medical journey or events or whatever, and add photos to illustrate, too. The sky's the limit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Have been using for a couple years. It's a good tool and gives you what you need for a simple journal. The extra bits are probably bits I don't need (sync with Google fit, mood chart etc) but I'm sure others find it useful. No complaints, but not so wow that I would say a must use. I like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ease of access, user friendly UI. Privacy control. Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use.. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is simple and does the trick for anywhere, anytime journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"No synchronisation to Dropbox and no Voice to Text . Waiting for these features to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal apk"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Would be even better if I could drop photos directly from my Google photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, but I paid for the membership but it still says i have to pay another fee for somethings so I'm a little confused, but I love it 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling tool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm loving my daily journals. This app has everything you need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"What more can I say. Does everything I want and more. Great to be able to share with my counselor too. Definitely like the reminder as my days are so hectic, I usually forget to journal. Gives me some 'me' time to take care of myself. 4/6/20 would like to add that I was offered a discount for update but was charged full price! Scam!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that i can add pictures and video to my entries and that it lets me share/log info from other apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is absolutely the best journal app I've ever. The interface is clean and modern and beautiful and it works with no issues. I have it on my Android phone on my Mac and on my windows computer. It's just so convenient because I can literally just start journaling on whichever device I'm using and it works and they all sync. I recommend Journey: Journal to EVERYONE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app fits the bill perfectly. I want to update my review after cancelling my subscription a while back since I feel this app is far too expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Charged me but I never authorized. Scam."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Definitely worth the one time investment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it is supposed to, and does it well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use it for quick daily ""jots."". Works well for me. Due to worsening effects of age and a traumatic brain injury, I find the app a more useful tool to help me document and better remember important aspects of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the personal tags that make looking up past entries as a group topic easy. You can open Journey and jurnal without having to enter time, date or weather. any many other settings from which to choose not the least of which is adding photo's to any entry. The Option to format text is not clear to me but I will not keep this from a deserved five star rating. One more thing; the app automatically saves and backs up your entries. I cannot say enough about the diary. Nice work folks!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"There are some good things about this app but it could be improved. For instance you are supposed to be able to set hour mood but no where does it actually explain how you fo it. Navigation on this app is a bit unnatural."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"my experience of journey is good i use it every day as a way of journallying my experience with god on my faith journey and find it very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its very useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I was looking for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to organize, tag and journal. Love it on my phone app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Cost Related issues. Why do I have to pay for this? I hope they make this for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is easy to use and the Markdown feature adds a nice aesthetic to the entire. It just gets better and better. Tech support is fantastic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and intuitive I like that I can add in pictures, videos, and links from other apps to make it easier to capture things I want to add to my journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"While not for me at this time, I will gladly give it a try in the future. Thank you for the response to my first rating! That's a first for me. It shows good attitude and work ethic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"folders for making sepereted journal is really neacassary and totally missing. Thanks for the fast answer. I saw that this feature was requested along time ago so the real question is when actually is it going to be？"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for journaling no matter what time allocation you have. I get ""throwback"" notifications often, and it's very interesting to see how things have changed over time using this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, the constant badgering to upgrade is a bit of a pain though. Not enough of a value add to upgrade"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hey! <3 quick review-word limit! +small background thing at the top is amazing! +love statistics thing-to reconnect the dots +Photos as small thumbnail-quick summary! +Atlas-holy for travellers :D -if I want to edit entry-tap on edit and scroll - takes so much time! reckon u let us tap on text so it jumps directly to edit? -photos appear in random order I'd like to edit that:( -photo limit too small for me would like to add video to photos don't want to add extra entry for a video only MUCH LOVE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"User friendly and cloud storage allow access from different devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app on android"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy interface and structure, easy to establish new journaling habits"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wish i could give it 0 stars. I didnt want to be signed up to the free trail and it did it wasnt clear how to come out of it and i was charged. They wont refund me and are now arent replying to me. Con artists."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am still trying to figure this out although it does seem fairly straightforward. I don't like the ads popping up but then again I haven't paid for anything yet so I'll just live with it. I'll come back and change this if I feel too deserves fivestars later. For now I think it's good enough to suggest someone to try to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it except the added costs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Didn't like"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's accessible and private. Exactly what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent tool! The paid upgrade daily offer is sometimes annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it .. u wont regret looking back. 100"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I am 100% happy with my purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful for keeping a journal. I use it nearly every day, and it keeps it all organized by the date and time. I mainly use it on my chromebook, but I also can on my phone (and any other device I wish). It has a lock, so no one can read my innermost thoughts... love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"GREAT APP! I just need to find time to use it more🤫🙄"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I used it daily. Very user friendly and most options available at no cost, for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Free version helped me remain engaged utilizing the app frequently. Paid version has adjustments, like dark mode and ability to add more photos, among others, that continue to make the use of the app more enjoyable. Its throwback reminders of previous journals are nice read for reminiscing or to see your progression. Overall use of the Journey is satisfying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is good, but the popups are so annoying. Every time I open the app, here we go with the limited time offers (not so limited, then). Question: if I buy the Lifetime Premium option, will I stop receiving the popups or are you going to keep asking me to become a member?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You help me truly think better. This app is awesome for daily routine and it will be good for nostalgic time, I think💛"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just the best experience ever! Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth any penny."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It helped me keep track of things while I was abroad, and present them in an organized fashion. Love the fact that I can add photos, location (automatically), mood, tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I really want to use this app on my phone, but it keeps stopping - I've never had a problem like this. I restarted my phone, I uninstalled and installed multiple times, but still the same. I am enjoying this app on my ipad, but I need to be able to use it on my phone (android). What can I do to fix this?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This personal journel is really simple, as simple u open ur book and start writing ur mind. Very recomend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Fraudulent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The reason I like this app so much is because I struggle with memory loss and so to have something that I can keep my memories in is incredibly helpful, not to mention it also has a password on the app so you can keep your memories secret as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the convenience and ease."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Every change suggested is explained or done. Customer service is amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely the best journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is based on only a weeks worth of use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just as a reminder it. The best way to keep track of your life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app just getting better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app and service is nice because it lets you write entried on computer, phone, or other device. You can add pictures to journal posts and also add tags to each post you write to help organize. Overall, the best journal app I've found (and I've searched extensively)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty Sweet Application, I utilize this application to journalize important Chit in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! There are no ads unlike some of the journaling apps I have used. The app has had a positive impact on my life. I strongly recommend you download this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use with an effectively simple interface and features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It is a little confusing to me. I thought it would be more like a scrapbook. Where I could add stickers, photos and write a brief paragraph. Doesn't want to work like that. Guess I've still got a lot to learn."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I can add pics directly from my phone to my journal. I can also write my entry the next day or whenever and back date it to the day I am journaling. I have suggested this app to many people since I learned about it at the Rootstech conference (genealogy) 3 years ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app it gets you motivated every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Doing good for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"$10.41/month? Uninstalling…"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to write. This app inspires me to do it on a daily basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is nothing short of amazing. All you need to write your experiences everyday. Look back at your life later and feel how much you have experienced ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"How to change app language?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There is only a free 7 day trial, once it's over you have to pay. This is not mentioned in the apps description. If it had been clearer I would have no complaint about the app itself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Totally disappointed 😒"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had the worst experience with the team..They auto renew your subscription with no reminder sent and then refuse to refund the amount even if you are not interested in using the service anymore.. I am never going to recommend this app to anyone.. The ways in which they deal with subscription is not at all transparent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No soy premium pero un así puedo usar buenas cosas de la app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really easy to use. I use it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm finding this a great app as someone who has never journalled before, it's easy to use and has encouraged me to start a journal during these self-isolating times of reflection."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I quit Facebook recently and I really just miss ""posting"" stuff. This app has filled that need. I can post all the rando stuff in my head, and pics just like FB. I just don't have an audience which is fine by me. This is definitely my new favorite app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"3-31-2020 update new desktop app is awesome! love this thing such a great way to chronicle my thoughts over time. just want to see a good backup story --- orginal 9-16-2016 review Make it so I can use google docs to edit on desktop and I'll give you 17 stars. The mobile experience is so tight I love it but desktop sucks. Also the tags could be better too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Doesn't have talk to text feature.... deleted the app the same day I installed it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is totally worth the money. It helps me continue to write down my thoughts everyday and is great to look back and see how I was feeling on a particular day. The app seems a little expensive at first but that cost is what keeps you writing in the app. It makes you want to use it to get your money's worth. Would totally recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have found this easy to use and organize well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, like calendar, so you remember when things happen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it for journaling, clipping, saving memories. Easy to use & to access daily and any time. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Surprisingly good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy app for logging your goals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and I like that I can sync my journals across different devices. The paid version is affordable considering the rich features it comes with."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, it helps with getting so much off my chest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Below you will find the developer trying to save face"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I l o ve using this app. I just pray that if i ever loose my phone, I can retrieve all these notes from the web, because if it does not then I will probably need to back everything up. That will be a bjt of an inconvenience for me, but doable. Thank you for this App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app which is easy to use. If you thought writing a journal was dreary, dull and uneventful this app will make you think again. It is a neat little app which is easy to use. The design is great and you can use it on more than one device and then just sync so that every device is updated with the latest content. You can add pictures and other things in your journal posts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy going , love the interface , love writing everyday from my phone or computer, and especially right now , being a part of this crasy world and this important moment of history, I want to be able to tell the story to my grandkids (if I make it till then) or just to not forget details ! You. An add pics or videos daily and you have a lot of options to make happy and comfortable to write your journal ! Enjoy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice to use. Easy layout and easy to add entries. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. But now the pictures I take aren't getting backed up to Google Photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am sorry to say I am reducing my rating from 5 to 3 stars. For some reason the app no longer gives me push reminders to write, and without those I forget to use it. This has been the case for two months or longer. It doesn't matter how functional the rest of the app is if the prompts don't work. Permissions are enabled in Android settings. I verified Journey's settings and made sure the app is up to date; if I open it on my own, suddenly the reminder pops up, exactly when I don't need it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome tool for journaling your thoughts and emptying your mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy it so far. I need to be more disciplined."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful easy to use multi functions love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Capable and well-designed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it. I can write in my journal without my hand hurting so bad I wanna cut it off. Haven't really done much else with it but the only reason I got it was so that I could journal without hurting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, allows you to attract files....great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too expensive for the limited features, and too expensive for the drain on the phone's resources."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Got this app so that I could use it on multiple devices... phone, tablet, laptop and a web browser as needed Very happy with the ease of syncing as I move between devices. The web browser is the only way that I was not perfectly happy. The text color is more gray than black and is hard to see for my old eyes. Look forward to using this app for years to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Instantly asked to pay I want a diary not a bill thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Too much darn persistence in asking for a rating"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been such a good journaling tool. Much easier than trying to avoid the hand cramps of writing. lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find it very easy to use and perfect for being able to keep a record of my days with photos and notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app works smoothly, easy to quickly add entries and pictures or audio to. It is much easier for me than using a paper journal, and the premium is actually affordable. The one downfall is, unless u catch the premium on a deal or can afford normally, the ad to purchase pops up every time you open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Beautiful app... If you subscribe, pretty average for everybody else. I'm not against buying apps, or subscriptions for that matter - I have several. I just wish for once a developer would make a subscription where you aren't automatically opted in after the trail. I would be happy to pay £10 one off for this app, personally speaking for how infrequently I'd use it, the monthly cost is too high. ✌️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Inspiring & Motivational."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update, I have been using this app for a while now I can honestly say it's a Great app very easy to use, I downloaded this app because My wife recently passed away and someone I know said to journal my feelings about what I am going through.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love it. It is a big private bit of my life I'm so worried they discontinue it one day. It is easily my most valuable app. I'm journaling my days in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps keep my journal habit going. Tons of features, clean interface. Worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Says it's free but it's only free the first week. Then you have to pay for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"have been using for years, never let's me down !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What I love is that I can make entries on either my phone or my laptop and they are synced through the cloud. It's also easy to edit entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wanted to access my google account and data. Couldn't progress further unless accepted. Then l saw it.was free for seven days. Go mine data from someone else!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great...easy to use in phone as well as PC. Th k you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. Makes journaling fun again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using it 4 days in a row and it looks great. Will see"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A good way to keep track of memories and events. I wish there was an easier way to link google timeline/maps ... The places you'd been ... To it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have written, copyright,2novels using Journey and have learnt the ropes like typesetting, paragraphs etc Publishers gave thumbs up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very fine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really like the convenience of this app. It is everywhere for me to just write and record my thoughts. TERRIBLE SPELL CHECK though. Just so amazingly incomplete. Otherwise great app so far. Update... Spell check has Improved thank you So much! The handwriting Could use Some help though, seems to Capitalize When it Should not. Still a great ap though. keep up the great work folks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for musing, contemplating, and release any ideas and thought. The UI design is also intuitive. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this as a gratitude journal, I purchased the one time life time access so I don't get adds"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is amazing app. I really like it. And I have successfully made it part of my morning routine. Which is a big success for me. 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for daily journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and reliable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, it is very useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its a journal....do want to keep one?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"New bottom navigation pane is Fugly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for about a year and it's the best journaling app. A few bugs, but overall an amazing choice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this application. It helps me to identify my roots problem by journalling and it is easy to remind me back the old event with using throwback functionality."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great. Allows pictures and emoji too. (let's you save screenshots of important conversations related to the journal entry)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I love Journey, I have used it long ago. As I log back into my old account, they pushed a ""limited time only"" offer for $20/year. I wasn't sure if they only offered yearly subscription service (I see no other options because of the pop up), so I thought, why not? Once I processed the bill, I saw that there were other options and one that i wanted: Lifetime premium. I requested a refund immediately only to be ignored by their ""support team"". Cool. Beware of buying their upgrades blindly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please make virtual backgrounds available on Android please, I feel so left out and sad that I can't put a virtual background and joke about having been to space or living in a animal crossing horizons village"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's great! I especially appreciate the fact that they respond to most/all reviews. It's great to know your being heard! But I have a question. Can you do audio entry with premium? Like a voice memo/recording?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and to integrate different media. Great way to record thoughts, memories, photos etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never leave reviews or purchase apps. Purchased this within an hour of using it. Over also never kept a journal before but turned to journaling as personal therapy in a difficult period in my life. Looked at a few others and the features available and ability to not have to pay a monthly subscription by ways of a one time cost to access the paid features sold me quick! Perfect app for both the seasoned journaler or a first timer like myself. Will definitely recommend this app to others!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Exactly what I wanted. Nice UI. Can upload photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm really excited about downloading this app, but the circle just keeps going around & around saying it's installing. I've been trying for about 4 days now. Help, thanks ( I have cleared my caches in the app)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect however since I am new to journal writing the coach feature is really great! Except for 1 thing only - it is not allowing me to subscribe to multiple coach programs like for example I want to start on the mourning journal but I also want to start the photo journal at the same time and promt me to do so in my notifications The Reminder feature can only remind me of 1 reminder only amd I cannot add additional reminders anymore I hope you can enhance these features 🙏🙏🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying easy access to journaling every day. I get a reminder, which is helpful to me, and the app is well-designed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this App, I am able to Express my self, relief some burdens any place or time I need to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent reminders to get newbies like me into the habit of journaling. Worth the paid subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good thing to have. I'm using it to record the big event in my life, Thanks to the development team. I think member ship is not right step, I would never pay for a membership of these sort. Clange the policy to one time pay then I'll pay dearly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple app makes it even more likely for me to use it every day. Speech to text is accepted. Also love the fact that you can add a few photos or a video. There is a limit of 10 photos or 1 video per day, but I've managed to just cover most important photos over a couple of days if needed. It is helping me a great deal in logging my daily feelings, and experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Great voice recognition when I want to voice journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps alot in managing my bipolar and triggers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seamless, Easy, Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving Journey app & PC program since New Years 2016, over four years. Amazing to have such a record of my life. I think I've become a better person in that time because writing about everything gives me so much perspective. Sometimes I use the speech-to-text option on my phone to journal as it helps unravel ideas, unpack feelings, record memories & write lyrics. I love that they brought more formatting options in the last few months, especially text color. Thanks for the journey! 🎭🎡🎢✈🌎🌌💜✨"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that I can use Google Assistant to type for me. And it's very accurate. That saves me alot of time typing in my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's koo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use! Paid $8 just to have the full version and love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I selected the free trial option but was billed for a whole year in stead of getting my 7 days to try the app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Plain design, easy to use 👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool. Allows me to just let everything out. No fear of somebody reading it too since it on the phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app in the play store. Getting the premium version is totally worth it. Works on different platforms and computers (I have it on my Galaxy Phone, Galaxy Tab, iPad and Mac). I just hope that devs will stop pushing their ads to premium users. Almost every time I log in, I get this in-app notification to avail of their subscription packages. How many times do I have to click ""No Thanks""? The reason why I bought Lifetime Premium is to avoid getting these promos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good as of now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"this is a really nice app, however it is impossible to use it unless you have pro version, otherwise always popup ads will show up to promote either subscription or premium. it wasn't like that before."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"pH journal now this is my thing. Once stability kicks all is well in my soul on my way to journeyo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best way to gratify oneself"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Best app that I ever used and purchased."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Preferred app for journal entries. Just awesome and everything you need with great features. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really great App, easy to use. I use it as a diary/journal and I love the way I can go back to a past entry to add a note or something I had forgot and it does not reorder the entry to the top as many similar apps do. My big disappointment is that it does not cater for folders so that it can be used for different categories of entry. Give us that facility please."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I love putting tags on posts to make them easier to search for later. Great for tracking sleep, symptoms for different doctors, as well as moods/dreams etc and general journaling. Great app, well worth the money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's worth the price. The microphone doesn't always get my words to text as spoke. But, not bad. I hate typing. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use. No problems. Nice to be able to add a quick thought for the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, it s a great digital diary. I love the fact that it is saved on the cloud."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that I can back it up online so I don't have to worry losing my journal on my phone because I know I can always find them back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far. Need to add some media. I know it does support media and photos. Hopefully voice messages as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This was a good app before all the invasive ads were implemented. Almost unusable from all the distractions and pop ups trying to get you to pay for premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good to use this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would give 5 if the paid subscription wasn't required for basic functionality.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a busy mom and this is a great way to quickly journal. Love that you can attach photos and video as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app out there. I love the quick write feature from the notification."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping track my health issues. I hope to start using it for gratefullness as well. Thank you for making my life better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app,easy to acces from app and pc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Ok app. Just annoying popups. I wanna get prenium soon just stop bothering me please for the love of all that is holy. Before I get my salary I'm going to consider Diaro. I prefer journey's sync so far though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hi everyone this isn't a good app. It's just a app where you type in how you are feeling and they have articles on happiness. It isn't worth the money I paid for and on top of that I asked for my refund but they has ignored me. Don't download this app! Save your money!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Right now, it's the perfect time to journal and this app it's just all you need to do it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app for diary writing and note taking. The free version gives just enough options to maintain a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Ok you convinced me, what with the quarantine and all. I purchased lifetime premium but the damn thing still wants me to buy a membership? What gives? Please stop, I did what you wanted me to do! I like the app but you guys push the upgrades a little bit too hard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to post and create entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Purchased, charged me and no upgrade. I paid $15 and was ripped off"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Allows you to install and provide permissions before hitting you with trial period. Would have bought, but not with this stealth tactic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Looks like it costs $18 to buy premium. But you also have to pay $2.50/month to use it cross-platform (PC & Android)?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using this app for quick, easy note taking & more. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this journal quite a while ago, but I'm now finally using it. During these days of the covid 19 pandemic, it's nice to be able to journal on a daily basis. And it certainly helps that the voice recognition works really well so we don't have to type all of it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it to track my weight. But i use it as a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still new to the App and I'm digitizing my journal. I'd like to be able to upload more images at once but the interface is very nice and I'm enjoying it. Went through 8 others before finding this one and I like it the best. Update: been using the app for a month, it's perfect. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good free journal app. I've been able to keep track of things a lot easier with this app. Thank you so much! <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying the things that are unlocked. I wish more elements would be available in the unlocked areas but am satisfied to some extent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. It's simple, easy to use, and a great phone journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best I've been using it to diarize my life and my thoughts for years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use journaling app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Im really loving it! I may upgrade to 5 stars once I really experience more of its options!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app that really helps you get some perspective on things!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hello.. How can I export audio/video files? Also where are these stored in cloud? Do I have a Google drive option?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LLP MUSIC ARTS ARTS BEAST REVELATION WINDTALKERS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Iam not paying for a journal that says free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. However, interface could be nicer, and 10 pics OR 1 video is too restrictive compared to some other apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like it. Plus a whole year membership is very affordable and it's completely portably for device to device. Great options for fonts and images lots of great prompts. Just a great all around app I think."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Keeps a clear record of my day easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice easy way to write a journal and save your thoughts and experiences. I would like the option of having more font options. ie. style, size, color, underline."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Auto renewals continues even if app is deleted. Instructions are to cancel auto renewal through Play Store. I have already spent an hour looking for how to cancel auto renewal unsuccessfully. SMH."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thumbs up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Was really good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for personal notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great and cheap but... 1) For Android (and possibly iOS as well) you can't create a template. I love the prompted questions, but there are also questions that need to be asked every day. I reached out to support and it appears there is no way to do this on Android. 2) You have to pay separately for the different platforms. For instance, if you mostly use the Android app, but will sometimes use the cloud (web) app, I believe you need to pay for a separate license I'm switching to another service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love putting my daily thoughts in this app. It's convenient because I always have it with me. Better than trying to carry a notebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used different Journaling apps but this is by far my favorite ❤️❤️. Had it for over 2 years now. Lost my phone once😭. Got a new phone and logged in sad😢, thinking I'd lost all I hadn't had the time to backup. However, once I logged back in, it was all there. 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use it daily!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Writing a diary through my voice, really helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Recent updates have made using the Coaching option impossible. You get a prompt but then it is impossible to respond to it which kind of defeats the purpose. I am paying extra for nothing. This app is no longer user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, I bought it because some of the functions I feel are necessary like the font editing. But a star off because the location tracking is pretty terrible. 90% of the time it's the wrong (or previous) location. Please try to improve it! Also, need more emoticons. Thanks, I'm overall enjoying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. I think it is by far the most advanced journal I have ever used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good for keeping track of pictures and adding descriptions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its changing my life🙃"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and perfect for that quick journaling access"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the app! great and useful. i would recommend if you like to journal or want to start!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app. You can add pics among other details, like what you're doing, the weather, weather, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that I can have access to my journal everywhere and anywhere, I can look at past dates to see how my path has changed, sometimes I dont even write, I just journal a picture for the day, because pictures are worth a thousand words. It's cool that I can do that. Love this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app itself isn't bad. It's certainly nothing special, but there's nothing really ""bad"" about it either. The reason I'm leaving this review is because you guys kept asking me to, and seeing as your underhanded sales tactics have annoyed me for weeks now, I guess I'll oblige. We both know your ""Restore Purchase"" option is intentionally meant to trick people into quick-tapping it because it looks just like the ""No Thanks"" option on your other annoying popup. I don't appreciate this. Do better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"খুব ভালো App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life Changing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app (eventually upgraded) for years. Absolutely no issues whatsoever. Love the convenience of it. Sometimes I don't have time to write much in the moment, so instead I create a journal entry, which documents the location, time, and weather, then add a few descriptive words to help stimulate memories for when I'm able to make a full and proper entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am a person who loves to journal and I absolutely adore this app!! I am very picky when it comes to picking one app and this definitely stuck out to me!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The push selling is relentless from the moment it's installed. I am a fairly prolific user of apps and tech and I don't often leave reviews, but the pushy selling warrants a warning to anyone like me that doesn't want to be constantly pushed to buy buy buy. Somehow leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Especially considering I came to this looking for something to practice gratitude - they just want your money that much is very clear."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best digital diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its better if you can attach picture in the journal not at the top."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Well... I downloaded this app because it seemed to be perfect for what I was looking for. Apparently I have downloaded it in the past (I have no memory of this but w.e). So I opened it and got multiple popups about buying it, a 60 second decision offering the membership at a discount (shocking imo to get people to impulse buy) but anyway I was offered the free trial again but it won't let me take it to try it. I probs would have subbed buy want to try it first =/"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have used this app for almost 2 years and overall I love everything about it. My only suggestion would be to add to the list of emotions available. I use Journey to track my cycles of depression and identify possible triggers along with my day to day activities, life experiences. So the emotions I am feeling vary widely. The option to search and sorry by emotion would be more useful and accurate, making paying for premium a no brainier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Updated review. Now works beautifully across all my devices (Android + IOs) 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like to put my thoughts down and this provides me a way without finding a pen and paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am well pleased"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"4 stars, because even a feature like italicising and bolding text requires some sort of payment. Other than that it's a decent app I suppose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lifetime premium is costly for me.. 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I've tried journaling the old fashioned way in a notebook and tried other apps and never could stick with it. But with this app i look forward to journaling and i love how it adjusts the time and location based on the pictures i took from today."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been wonderful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Customer service just doesn't reply. They replied once and then I have not heard from them. I sent 4 messages and NOTHING. I was asked to email (below) and still no one replied!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome. Its been helping me with therapy and general tracking. I really wish I could also have audio notes so on a day when I dont feel like writing, I could just speak and it could save my recording"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so far. Easy to use and keeps my thoughts in order."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely .. I enjoy using this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not as great as expected."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nicessss app 👌💯%"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great. The only thing I have complained about is, I bought 'extras' on my IPad. But then I also have the app on my android phone but didn't have the paid extras on it. Which means I have to buy and pay again just to get the extras on my android phone. They should sync it, cause anyway it's on the same account. And also, I hope you let us choose atleast 2 coach. Cheers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a beautiful app for documenting the feelings you have. Through the images and writing, I can relive some of the previous posts. The added information adds to the experience. I am a lifetime member."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this. I copy all the cute texts about my grandkids so we have a record of them growing up. Love that you can attach pictures"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You have to pay to unlock night mode. They provide one time offers and push you to buy it as soon as you start using the app as a first time user. How can you persuade a user who has never used the app before to buy it? There should be some room to atleast try before you buy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Secure, easy to use, and I'll never lose my entries. ❤❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Day 2 of using the free version, cause ofcourse I gotta test it out first, and the ""coach"" feature is still showing me the same prompt of the previous day. Sigh. This is an important feature for me. Otherwise it's visually appealing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Self reflection via journaling is a critical pre-requisite in a good leadership process and this app is one of the best tool to do it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app because I like to talk more about my feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this. My online journal. Great for fitness tracking. food tracking and personal feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Endless harassment to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's just as easy as using a social media app, and probably a better place to post things since it is a journal. Didn't give it the 5th star because it would be nice to load multiple pictures at once as well as more than just 4. Also, it will stop working at random times, especially if I've been inputting pictures in many consecutive entries. Update--(Increased rating from 4 to 5 stars) Thanks for adding the ability to attach multiple pictures at one time and increasing the number of pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app, I can take a picture, then do an entry later and the app will adjust the time and location to that of the picture. Awesome time saver when out and about and then still accurate later!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal. It does everything I want a journal to do and more. You can put tags on your entries and search them up later! I went ahead and bought the lifetime of premium because I liked the benefits it came with and it wasn't all that expensive. My only issue is the location picker for the entries. You have some that aren't even available anymore, but its still listed. Why? A small eyesore, but the app is still great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app has great functions and I could customize my diary with different colors, headings, and other favorable options. It also auto-saves my writing, which is wonderful. However, there are bugs that I sometimes cannot change the text colors even when I highlighted the text. And after I had edited my writing, I noticed that the saved content has wrong formatting, like the bullet points are out of order so time is needed to fix those. Hope there will be an updated version to fix those bugs, thx"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. The only thing I wish I could do is to separate journals for an easier way to follow my notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If my soul could express the gratitude that I feel towards this app, I'd be able to hire Jeff Bezos as my personal assistant. Here's the real review: -I am still testing this app but the love & care put into the features has helped me draft my proposal for community outreach"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, love the reminder options, but really surprised about how I'm feeling lighter with the ability to 'talk' to my journal and get those heavy thoughts out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am an infrequent user but like Journey very much for keeping a photographic record of my travels. It is very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"why to add banner ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Dark mode is locked behind a paywall and the app refuses to go in landscape. I use a keyboard on a tablet to write which makes writing in the app impractical."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love how this app helps me stay on track with Journaling, and all the options for enhancing the entries are fantastic!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app for journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've only been using it for a few days, but so far I love it. It's really helped me be accountable in my prayer life and in keeping a spiritual Journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Bought it loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A lot of ads for paying to upgrade. Wish all the features were free. But other then that. It does it's job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Sweet, may or may not increase rating. Only Time will tell."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful & saves putting pen to paper & ending up with hand ache after you've just finished writing your 5th of 8th page of events that occurred on that day. Never had any issues with this app either which is an added bonus in my opinion. A Very well put together app most definitely. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very beautiful app. The best thing is the throwbacks. Just love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app for ideas and daily thoughts! I love setting up reminders to write about recurring dreams in the morning!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This really helped me express my thoughts and clear my mind. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like using this program."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Helped get me to a better place. UPDATE: had to move this app between phones three times now and its super easy which I really appreciate. Only kinda gripe I can think of is I paid for lifetime premium when I first got it and it keeps asking me about upgrades, but I havent lost functionality so it seems to know I have it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it began using it after birth of my daughter. use to log milestones, photos of meeting ppl for the first time etc. It will backdate to when a photo was taken if you want to add a past entry. Plan on giving password to her when she is older to look back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is great! I love it. The reminders are just right. And it's lovely layout and it's free! :) It's just the ads for the premium that are annoying. Everytime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"We are really enjoying this app for home education. Just wondering if there is any way of sharing with relatives without giving our log in details?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This beautiful app made me fall in love with the art of journaling.its a great one for people who are self-aware, & would love to document their journey in life, either for private use or hopefully share their life's journey with the world someday. It will sure get you disciplined as well in the process."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app so much. Is great keeping a diary at all time on my phone. This helps me write what I dream of that day,felt or any other thoughts or things I did. It's great looking back at my older notes because I usually forget what I did before so this helps me know some of the things I've done. ( I'll most likely buy the premium plan soon because this app so amazing and thanks again for this app)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Clean interface. So far I think this is an excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey keeps on crashing ever since I installed new stable chrombook update...... it really sucks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still learning but looks great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easily the best journal app I've tried"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity of the app, however it would be great if we can upload more than 4 pictures per journal entry. It's hard to pick just 4 pictures 😂 Update: Been using this app since 2016. Wish I used it earlier than that. I really love the fact that i can just read and reminisce abt the past without other people secretly reading it (hello notebooks!) FIVE STARS NOW!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience, been using it for 3 years now and it has never let me down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal is a great app! It gives you all sorts of options for your entries. It's also very simple to utilize. I think almost everyone could benefit from journaling with this app ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal app. It's so helpful to be able to have a place to write down how I feel when I can't actually use a pen and paper to write because of my hands hurting and being numb quite a bit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that I can make an ongoing journey on multiple platforms..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"What have you done?! The new update seems terrible. My entries keep deleting themselves while I'm writing them! Put the old code back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Revising review. After a great trial, decided to pay for it. Limited moods included with payment. No ads. Have new fonts and themes, but if you change them, it changes everything for ALL your entries instead of just being limited to that day's particular entry. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. Should be able to change mood, font, theme for each entry only so as to add variety and depending on what you feel during that day while writing the entry. Instead, ALL entries get changed. Dumb."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app 😆"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this but STOP WITH THE POP UP ADS I WILL NOT BE FORCED TO PAY FOR A MEMBERSHIP THAT COST THAT MUCH I LITERALLY CAN'T EVEN SCROLL THROUGH MY FEED WITHOUT HAVING A MEMBERSHIP AD COME UP EVERY 2 SECONDS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to edit and use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember how and when things happened. My best feature of Journey is it sends me flashbacks of occurrences that happened on the day say 2 years ago. Let's you reminisce, especially great when you're having a bad day. Brilliant!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"(1) HELP! I forgot my password.....what can I do (crying)!!! - (2) Very useful advise and very efficient team! Love uuuuu!!! - (3) Journey 一直是我所喜歡的日記app，我用他長達五年，紀錄生活中的大事，漂亮有設計水準的介面，以清楚的邏輯設計的app，能設定密碼、能記錄心情、能設定位置，還能有歸類用的hashtag。推薦大家使用，一定會愛不釋手！"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Says password is incorrect even though i updated it online. Tried clearing cache and it still won't work. My account logs in fine on a browser. Garbage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing journal app you can write an entry and attach pictures. A very good free online journal. I would recommend to everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App.....Period"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've ever downloaded and paid for. I now have a chronicle of my life. It really helps me when I have no one around to vent to. And I also love reading my memories from previous years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"For the past 4 months, my app is not working properly like when I'm typing the Page starts scrolling automatically. Pls suggest me a solution. But the shop is great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Auto location and weather is the best 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just had surgery on my spine. This really helps me track what meds I took, and when. No guessing on next doses!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Does what is says it does and more :) took my journalling to a new level. Also the throwback journal feature rocks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app ive never had any issues with it and have used it for almost 3 yrs i wont use any other journal app i have it synced to all my devices works great on them all highly reccommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hello Journey! Thanks for making this amazing app ,as y'all know I've been using this for about 3 years now . And I think we should get dark mode of even non white Mode without purchase! As 90% of other journaling apps now have that as a normality. I don't want to switch but the light mode feels pretty heavy now THANKS ♥️👌🥺"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. This app has kept me writing since the beginning of year. I am really seeing changes. Thanks to the developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish the reminders were more consistent. If I fail to open the app up one day it doesn't prompt the following day. Overall good content, has been helping me to reflect and I dont need to spend 30 mins writing out my whole day I just jot down what's important."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app wish there were more features though in the free version like font styles"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi by ct no"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and has all the basics you would like"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome diary app simple and easy to use has password lock as well as back up direct to google drive...! Has some extra features like attaching a photo but I prefer to just keep it simple and only write daily activities events etc... 😆 love the material design as well perfect! This is how apps should be designed simple and attractive. 05/03/2020 started using this app again after few years of no use. Still the best planner/diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for four years now and I love it still!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app, I use it on special occasions to keep my memories recorded. Beautifully designed app. Loved it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App was nice to start. It was a bit annoying that every time I opened it it asked me to upgrade. I used it for about two weeks and saw that my entries were there both in app and online so I figured all was synced up. I got a new phone and re installed the app and all my entries except for the first one were gone. There should probably be a warning or pop up that reminds you to manually sync if it's necessary. They give a pop up to upgrade every day might as well give a helpful pop up too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fab!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Putting night mode behind a paywall is an instant 1 star, bro"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, works so much better for me than a physical journal and it has everything I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this app so farx as it helps me to be mindful of the present moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you dont journal make it a habit and inst all this app. You will see changes in your life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"If I could give this app less than one star I would. I liked this app as the purpose that it was intended for. I no longer will be using this app. The problem was when I first got the app I paid for lifetime premium subscription. Apparently the lifetime ends after one year. I was charged for another year for subscription for annual not lifetime. When I tried to get a refund I got stonewalled. I had to go through Google to get my refund and not the developer. They are only in it for the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seems legit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is lovely. It's really fun to be able to jot down my thoughts, save pictures, make a quick entry to remind myself, etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Works well at all times."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the app is getting better with new functionalities and because of it i enjoying journalling a lot more. hoorayy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was tricked into pre paying for the year. So I use the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good interface, great organization. EXTREMELY pushy. Locking features behind a paywall is fine I guess, but constantly bugging me to spend money on it is really annoying. And now, it gives me a prompt to rate it 5 stars, and there's no way to *exit* the prompt. It requires you to leave the app and go to the play store. A diary shouldn't stress it's users out, that's the opposite of the point of the app. I guess the features make up for it somewhat."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Quick to add entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sucks! After installing the app says 7days free trial only. If it's said outfront I wouldn't have installed it. Uninstalling after the s feedback v"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't say a lot, but nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so easy to use. I love how it reminds me to journal at the time I set up. I'm actually happy that there are not a lot of extra bells and whistles because it really makes me focus on what I need to do, which is simply to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb Journal Diary app! Used this app for over 2 years now and it's a great way to track my daily achievements, thoughts, what went well and didn't go well. Love how I can attach photos and tag each day with a theme. Premium version was worth it for the cost and lifetime use of the app. Very happy, I hope this app continues to grow and stays as secure and user friendly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Reminder function and the dictionay function does not work. I have tried to solve the problem via the feedback function, but unfortunately communication is not their strongest point."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for a week or so now and it has really helped me. As someone with depression it has helped immensely to have somewhere to write about how my days are going and what is going on in my head and get all of the negative thoughts out of my head."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish there was an ios version too. Edit: there is now!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app regularly and have been for over a year now. That alone should say something."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the simple interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Used it during couple of months. Then it was broken - online version is not available for my account. Communicated a lot with support but finally nobody answered me anything. Bad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Im still trying to get used to using this app -but so far all I can say is that it bothers me a tad that every single time I open it up -Im asked to go premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's super simple and very intuitive to use. I haven't used too much of the advanced features but what I have used, I really liked. I also contemplated getting an actual journal, but for 5-8 dollars, I figured I got way more out of this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far the best journaling app I've ever used!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. Love the reminders and the security"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Since my phone is always handy I find it easier to be motivated to share my thoughts when I have a spare minute or too, and it's easy to go back and look through them all later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this application. I can write everything and anything in one place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me organize my thoughts, I just wish that they didn't constantly encourage me to buy the upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app the only down fall is that you can't add heaps of attachments in the one entry you have to have a few entires for the one day if you want pictures & a see recording"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I use it almost everyday. I just wish it had template support in the mobile version. Also some weird behaviour when using the built in templates and then opening on mobile. But gernally speaking fantastic! Also being able to upload a mix of. Videos and images together would be nice. Also most frequent tag to come to the top of the suggestion box, rather than alphabetical."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super handy to have with you at all times!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this App. Very simple to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Especially the reminders with the pictures to do the media journaling. It's like a scrapbook! Sooo cool. Definitely recommend getting the premium version. It's worth it 😊🥰💗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good 👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Kept locking me out and couldn't get back my journals. Also no templates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great I write anyway it's very therapeutic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice, simple journal. Easy to use, desktop access, printing, exporting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been looking for a diary app that allows me to create entries both on the phone and via my laptop, so this is great! The only downside I see so far is that the Journey app for macOS needs further payment aside from the subscription that I'm paying, so I'm sticking to the web browser as it is. Would be nice to be able to access the app on laptop though, especially after subscribing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Journey not only to record my thoughts, feelings and experiences, but also to copy and paste articles, scriptures and other information I want to be able to find quickly. The information is synced across all my devices and online, so even if a device fails, I will not lose my precious entries. Using Journey had been a great experience for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"JOURNEY! DIARY! **** I like the way Journey syncs between almost all of my Apple, Android, PC devices. They must be updated to the most current version Available through! The only thing I am not absolutely sure of, after sharing my personal life Journey, is if it's an absolutely secure connection? If I could be assured of that I would absolutely give it five stars......"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Why I can't sign in with my Google acc?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Solid app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever!!!! I pushed ""Add Password"" and I added one and it didn't let me in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I paid for full membership as I like the extra features. I use this journal for when I'm having my triggers and when I can't write I can record my voice and it will save in the journal. Really glad I found this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a nicely designed journal that you can access either via the app or on a browser. Things sync very nicely even on the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use and clear layout."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this App. I have been using it on several of my journeys and I just love the stuff I can do with it!! Thanks for creating such a great and useful App. 😊😊😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!!!!! Update Feb 20 With the ""Coach"" tool, it has brought journaling to a whole new level. Oh my God!!!! It truly is one of the best app for me. I love love love love love it. You guys bring meaning to life through this app. The amount of inner peace it brings me is truly outstanding. Thank you truly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"After an initial one star review I have to say that it does what it does super well. A really good journaling app, professionally designed. Throwback feature is what makes it sing and tapdance. Why 4 stars not 5? The setup wizard is confusing, leading me to pay for a Membership plan subscription at 34 $ in advance although I have lifetime premium. Upside? The app is so good I am ok with that. The refund policy is very fair and no quibble, too, if you are adamant. I am happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Living it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Helps me remember my daily events and account for my time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app. easy to use, cross platform so i can use this anywhere. bought lifetime premium when offered"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app, free or paid version is amazing. If you need a journal and you don't have pencil and paper, this is the next best thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Love using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app to keep track of your daily life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely In Loveee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Couldn't scroll down to decline an offer so it was unusable. Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is the best. I totally love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Every time I take a picture it asks if I want to put it in a journal. Most times I don't but it's a nice prompt. Decided to upgrade, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is that I can't seem to cross different applications with paying for the app. I can't use it on my PC, even though I paid for the app. Change that and I'll give it 5 stars, but other then that it works well across different devices. Just wish I could actually use it on my PC as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For what it is, it's excellent: a simple, private journaling app that has a nice interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app has everything I need at this point in time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Nothing I can think of that's wrong. Awesome job. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very great app for journaling. Helps me keep my mind focused on bettering myself and living up to my goals. Only complaint is the amount of ads the app has despite having purchased lifelong premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I thought I was getting the free version and a few days later there was a $30 charge on my account which caused it to overdraw. I didn't even have a chance to try the app and already I was being charged. Not cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to write into. And easy to manage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic Journal, and cross platform support is fantastic. I upgraded to lifetime premium and it's well worth the upgrade. I mainly use it on my iPhone but the android app isn't lacking in features. One thing I would love for you to add is the ability to add different journals for different things. If this could be looked at and added, the app would be absolutely perfect in every way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for saving short (or long) journal entries. I have noticed one bug to do with the weather. For some reason it shows temps in the 80's (F) while im taking pictures of a snow storm... Definitely not accurate. And while I do love the ability to attach pics OR video to an entry, I wish it could be both at the same time and perhaps with the option to attach much more than just 1 video or 4 pics. For these reasons I give it 4 stars but it really is a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app is ok and the ads suck. I understand that you want to sell the premium features (=formatting lol) but I disagree that this needs to be advertised with idiotic ""sale"" popups and overlays every day! Personally I would have considered the premium features if not for these aggressive ads. Edit: developers' response is another ad to get me to buy the premium features..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I think it's a great app. However, if you're not planning on spending money, you might want to look elsewhere as the ads for the premium version are constant and pretty annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun to use. I converted to this app, from another one that I had been using for several years. The other one failed to work on all the platforms even though the promise was it would. This works much better, is easy to use and I love the way it pulls up entries from several years back to match the date you address on currently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, really easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for cross platforms, I have used for portfolio work when I've just wanted to add little snapshots. Generated a word document with it all afterwards and simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"would rather not be asked EVERY time if I wish to make a new entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal in all the land! 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far it's been a good experience. I like the automated prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, been using it for years! I love the atlas feature for entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Disappointing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Use it to record memories of fun and learning with my kiddos. The tags make it even more useful. Was looking for something like this for soo long. Thank you!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, and the new journal coach is a great addition to the app. If they added a habit tracker it would be even better, but I'm quite happy with the app as it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic digital journal. It has all the featutes that i need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't get enough. Just as I like it - esthetically pleasing and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Impeccable!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App keeps prompting me to rate even though I did a long time ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app so far. It gives me a place besides paper to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall good experience but I wish various suggestions would happen enabled in application such as affirmations, commitment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Reminder stopped working. Now I forget to write everyday. Customer service is always away, not much help. Hoping for an answer. Premium user here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect! I love this app. All of the features are well worth paying for. I use this app daily and love the throwback entries. Love the ability to add photos to my post, and I love that the app reminds me to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling. Works flawlessly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As i watched my life begin to crumble i had no idea how to find my way. Journaling has helped me to find a center and better understand myself. This ap was the perfect tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for journaling, love how it sinks everything across all devices and your entries are never lost to time, you can always look back at what you wrote years before. Extremely helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing No glitches"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have wanted to get into daily journaling for a while and paper journals just didn't seem to cut it for me. So I looked into a few different journaling apps, and this one by far has been the best. Full disclosure I paid for the full version of this app, but the prompts (aka coaching) it's just enough to get me started writing which was always a problem in the past. and being able to set reminders daily on my phone to actually journal in the morning and evening helps me to habitually write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In love with the 'Journey'.. Completed 3 years and I didn't skip to write the journal a single day. It gives me an excellent opportunity to find what happened on the same day in last 3 years.. Never thought of using any other journal apps afyer finding 'JOURNEY'. 💕📝"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and cool review features. The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app, its simple and easy to use. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great companian to bullet journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seamless"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app easy to use and has been consistantly stable for the 3 years I've been using it. Very happy😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. Makes it easy to keep a daily journal and to find entries afterwards."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Asked to sign up for premium at a discount with the special offer requiring sign up right then, without even having a chance to try the app or learn more about the benefits. Not cool. Evernote gave me time to try and still got a discount. Edit: The in-app pop-up offer said that the offer would no longer be available once I close it. I got another nag about it later. Be more honest with an accurate time frame. And be more thoughtful and sympathetic in your responses."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have purchase for a lifetime, but why doesn't my account get an upgrade?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good App, but not being upfront about multiple platform premium cost is super shady. One would expect a premium cost to get you premium service in the form of something simple as access across all platforms. EDIT: Thank you for the reply, unfortunately that information is not disclosed in the 1 minute you have when you access the app for the first time and receive the premium discounted price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to record thoughts. Nice interface. I like recording my mood and being able to add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for photo diary I have found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used it for 4 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very happy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I would like to buy the pro version soon. Why I am going to buy it? I really enjoy to use this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is helping me journal on a regular basis. I've struggled with journaling by hand for some time, so this makes it easier."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My best friend..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Curious to see if it keeps all my entries on the free version over 800 entries and I feel like I can recall all of them. Recently changed phones scared I couldn't pick up where I left off. But I did."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to dictate my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a simple app. I like the ability to tag my entries so I can return later and reflect on certain topics that I've been working towards."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, hope to keep it for a long time!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've shared all my life experiences and all the things I want to record for myself or rather tell myself and remind myself and maintaining a diary like entry in an app like this is perfect. I've been using this app for a long time now and I've always been impressed with the ease of usage and it continues to remain a rather useful app. I'll give a 5 star rating just for that. Thanku👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Shouldn't be just a trial."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great simple way to keep a journal. Love the pictures add on and location and calendar features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me by journaling my mental health, I sometimes forget about it but always come back to it and it's good to see the history, day by day progress or not. Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My experience with Journey is amazing! I can really express myself through journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An exceptional app. I never used to write journals. But with this, things seem fun. Definitly recommended to anyone looking for a diary/journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE the format! Especially enjoying the reminders to actually use it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"just got it a few days ago, went ahead and upgraded to premium membership, figured it would give me more incentive to write in it, uf i paid a few bucks! really like it, love all the features! love getting all the junk and thoughts out of me, and writing them down, does help to remember, to get it out, and i am loving it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a full featured journaling app, so far it has met my expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"More features than I know to use; very happy with this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I think it's time for lay offs. The dev has become rogue, we get notification every now and then inspite of paying for it already."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Highly recommended to all users!! Edit: I wish that the Mac app is cheaper. But that's okay. Ive bought it last night. WOW. What can I say. This app blew.my.mind away. My entriea are downloaded automatically into the Mac. I can now continue to write on my Macbook hehe. I totally recommend this app to everyone. Especially thos who likes to travel. Oh did I mention that the app works offline? I tried Penzu before, and they can't work offline. But Journey can! Wooott! Back to writing !!!! Edit 11 Feb 2020: Still liking it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it so far.....does everything I need it to do 👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app should not get an Editors recommendation! The messaging in the app installation directions are unclear, and suggest that if one clicks on a Google Cloud button, this automatically initiates a 7 day trial period, followed by automatic monthly subscriptions IF YOU DO NOT OPT OUT. You should give client option of deciding NOT to continue with 7 day trial period. This is an unfair practice if my understanding is correct. I think Play Store should check this product - this not 1st complaint"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app...most potential...easy to use...very useful..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to match fotos and experiences and also allow my thoughts to come along. Helpful in this day of social media to have a system that is just for you. As a journal or diary would have been, and not for the world to see, but still at your fingertips."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Predatory sales tactics: A 60 second timer for a massive markdown on a subscription should never be the first thing a customer sees on opening an app they've never even used. This tactic is a direct violation of the Consumer Protection Act."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So perfect! It's there for me when I want to add or re-read."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I installed it and right away it's trying to entice me to grab the half price upgrade deal with a 1 minute timer, without me having used the app. Even if I like the app, I'm less inclined to subscribe due to these tactics. Forgot to mention, they'll offer you a trial for premium and hope you forget to cancel. Not a good first impression."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"5 stars the best diary journal for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used it everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I share to this App from many other Apps. From documenting pictures and commenting on them, to archiving my I Ching readings with thoughts on it. Journey is one of my favorite and most useful tools for life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean and easy to use interface. It does exactly what it says: gives you space to put down your thoughts in a journal. No distracting ads or features. I also like that I can upload an entry either via the app on my phone or online through a browser - more flexibility that way. I've used the app for a couple of years or so and am happy to continue to do so."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really visually pleasing app with an easy to understand system. Not too expensive if you want to upgrade, but also great as a free app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app journey diary awesome if u love writing exploring yourself this is a must"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent, great for using as a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's fine. But the fact that if have to pay 4$ a month for something as basic and essential as a 'night mode' is why I uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use and so handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have already paid for this year and am being charged again. Please check your records."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a great app, but they make you pay for every single different app. Android, Mac, PC, Apple, online... And then of course the subscription. That's very very irritating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, only bother is that there's a limit to the amount you can attach (photos, voice recordings etc.) to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is wonderful app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, I used to put these stuff in a notepad but this is great for organizing my thoughts and experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"""Buy me"" very aggressive app !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best journaling app. doesn't get in the way of writing by default but provides useful things like prompts if you need them. just perfect design"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not trust this company. Though they make great apps, they have recently proven that they are completely lacking in ethics and morals. With their JotterPad app, they offered a ""Pay once, use forever"" model, which I and many people paid for. Recently they removed features that we paid for and moved them into a new subscription model, essentially asking us to pay for the same features again. They did this without warning users in any way. Given that they've shown themselves to not be trustworthy, why would you trust JOURNEY with your data -- especially private data about your family, personal life, travel, etc. Nothing can stop them from changing the rules and claiming they now own your data and could resell it or do whatever they wish. It doesn't matter if that's not in their Terms of Service today -- they now have a history of deceitful and deceptive business practices. It's one thing for them to take your money, it's another for them to use your data. AVOID. UPDATE: notice in their response to my review, they do not refute anything I've said. They just don't want users to know the truth so have asked Google to delete."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great place for my random thoughts, convenient, easy to use, and organized. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A Beautiful Note Taking Experience. It allows you to capture photos, write thoughts and memos about yourself, and has all the logging capabilities that can help remind you of the time and place of the entry (Location, Weather, Your Activity, Your Mood). It is a thoughtful experience and well worth the price you pay for the app itself. The subscription is another matter altogether, but you don't need to worry about that to get a pretty long lasting app that allows you to journal your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Even if you purchase a ""lifetime membership"" they still want to charge you a monthly $4 fee on top of that to use all of the features. Absolutely ridiculous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app was great in 2017, why change things without any proper benefit? Please update, i can't scroll through my days when I'm in calendar view.. before, i could browse through weeks and months, read what i had written n view pics.. now I've to click on each day, exit and then click on the next day :((("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my journal needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is a really good journal app with many good features, but since an update of about 12 months ago, the area of screen real estate has been reduced considerably by the introduction of a row of icons placed above the keyboard. Since their introduction you are left with less than 50% of the screen which is visible when you type. I find this a bit off putting. It would be much better if you could hide these icons and open them only when needed. Apart from that, great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am liking this app more. I now accept that I need the prodding to ""type"" my thoughts -- I'm old school pen and paper journal person. I will explore how to upload art doodles I create. I have the lifetime premium version. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Quick and easy to enter items and photograph receipts or photograph e-mail invoices . Just nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it like a real diary. Its awesome as a place you note your bucket list."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far the best journaling app. I've been using it for years and they keep updating and improving it constantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app for keeping a daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I finally subscribed to premium. This journal helps me sort my private thoughts and keeps things simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish we had a little more control options like MS Word. Like treat columns for habit trackers that we can use and doodle drawings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Wish there was a way to divide my my entries into folders instead of just tags"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app. It had helped to keep me on track with my journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a very good application and one of my top selections among numerous journaling and diary applications in the Play Store. There is one omission that I want to have but is missing. That is the ability to add expense entries for any day. Ideally I should be able to scan a receipt to accompany an expense. The scan should algorithmically find the borders of the receipt similar to CamScanner, Google Drive's Scan function, etc. Minimally though, at least add a photo of the receipt. One other application, Universal Diary, has receipt addition as an optional entry for any given date and thus, currently is my first choice for diary and journalling. I can add expenses and income as an option for each entry. I can also add checkable tasks as well. I have Journey also currently installed and monitor updates for both. Consider adding receipt and task options in a future upgrade and I will change my rating from 4-start to 5-star. Also, don't forget to add back up to Google Drive, export PDF, share, etc. Thanks. Update 2020-02-18 @ 12:45:00 Well, we're coming around almost two (2) years later and don't see any indication for support for daily expenses as initiailly suggested. Oh well...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately this app is lousy when used on a Chromebook. Many of the formating options don't work. Unable to attach a photos to entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very happy with Journey. The different options for posting are perfect. Highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but it pushes buying itself even after you already have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent diary easy to use good sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I had to buy mutiple times.. 1 on windows 2 on android and I am supposed to buy it to have features on the web version?? Also the android version isn't chromebook friendly...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Purchased this expensive as he$! app for my wife, not knowing it is ""non-transferable "" Would be nice, if that was fairly close to being upfront info at time of purchase, not on page 4 of the small print."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to write your journal entries into!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is really a great tool to keep your daily diaries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you so very much. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Supwr"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"YESSS SO GOOD 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love it. I'm 53 and decided to start journaling so I can retrace my days. I'm only using the free version however, I will likely go to the lifetime premium very soon. I highly recommend. Easy to understand, all you really need to do is figure out what you want to journal. Thanks Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It helps me keep track of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As I go through life I have made so many memories that I end up forgetting some great ones. This app is great for memorializing the small things that make life great. The use of pictures is ideal because I've always been terrible at finding time for journaling, but uploading a pic and jotting the highlights is a breeze."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can not recognize this journal buy the advertisement or name."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Will not go without it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A daily writing journal while expecting to miss some days!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app for daily writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal, very easy to navigate. 🌍 Update: I re-installed this app after some time and I am very happy that I did. Thinking about upgrading, not sure yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I started with Day One that seems to have pulled the app from Google Play with no notice. That said, Journey is a pleasure to use with lovely fonts and writing environment. It has become my go-to place for writing now and I won't be reverting. Just hope that Journy doesn't ever pull in the same way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easily keep track of my daily schedule love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think the app is great for writing those unexpected things that happen and want to recall in a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Anticipating Excitedly....ill.be.back...lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found this app very useful and has become to become a habit adding entries. Also the availability of prompts of various subjects helps a great deal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very vertisale app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun and personal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience. And I love that I take a pic of myself every day and it to my journal for the day. It's confirmation of everything for the day. I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thankful for this app as it has made journaling easier. Love the fact that you can save inspirational photos etc too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app available. It's simple, intuitive and minimal in all its features - pro is highly recommended. I tried the most downloaded similar apps of the Play Store, but this is the one that lets you turn your thoughts into words immediately, privately and genuinely. Others may care about reminders, tick boxes and stuff like that, but keeping a journal is about digging your soul and your thoughts, with no useless stuff in the way. Are you looking for a journal app? Look no further."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well, easy to use and document your days. Even checks for new pics and reminds you to log what they were about, If you allow it and wish to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I luv this journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its easy to use, and I can really express myself through pictures, location and media clips. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to express yourself through easy to use and has an easy passcode for access!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seamless across several devices over time. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a good dairy app overall. However, it still doesn't support Pixel 4's Face Unlock feature even it starts targeting API 29 and supporting many other Android Q features recently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like and love to use this Journey because it is really good,nice and beautiful.😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣🙉😺😸🙋💁🙆"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app with the right balance of security and usability"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would love to purchase it. How cam purchase it from Nepal. Direct dollar payment is not allowed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Liars and thieves. Do not waste your time your money or your sanity. They will charge you multiple times and steal your money. The app crashes on launch, if you do get a subscription it disappears and reappears randomly. Rude ridiculous con artists. STAY FAR FAR AWAY AND TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO AVOID THESE AWFUL PEOPLE. LIARS and thieves!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I shopped a lot before choosing a journal app and I definitely made the right choice. it's easy to use and has great features. I especially love the throwback entries and that I can edit the date/time for entries so I can record in hindsight. and it's all cloud based so I can access from any of my devices! it would be cool if I could also set a custom reminder for an entry so on a specified future date, app would pop-up a reminder for me to review it (for reviewing progress on goals, etc)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just an amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Only started using it recently and I love everything so far - from the interface to the simplicity of the process of penning thoughts down. My only concern remains about privacy, that of my private information and data vis-a-vis the devs themeselves. If I can be assured of that, I will certainly be considering upgrading to pro. I hope the developers will kindly respond to my inquiries about provisions for privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good I like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Has been so helpful. A great tool to Chronicle your day at any given moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good,complex and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"U have everything u need in a journal u can imagine... Only thing is u have to pay for some extra features... Other than that it's the best one available... Slightly concerned whether they'll charge to retrieve in future... 😜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it amazing easy and friendly use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journalling system is great. I don't use it as much as I should, but I know when I do because my thoughts are generally more clear and put together."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too much in app ad showing each time I use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app alot and I am trying to use it more often. I wish they would remove Google Picker if it is no longer supported and streamline the geotagging."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Instead of using Facebook, I use this to pour all emotional moments, thoughts, and whatever that's in my head. Good way for de stressing rather have everyone in the social world know about you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I need to do is perfectly done. Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app but would even love it more if it had integrations with other apps to automate the Journaling process."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app but with the free version it will spam you with ads for the paid tier after every entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app, it where i can keep my thoughts and its really easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The editing interfere of the new version uses rich-text editor instead of markdown format, which is absolutely nonsense for copy and paste between this and other apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Honestly. Annoying to pay for full app. But worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The new update takes this app from 1 star to 3; I can add multiple vids to a post and add from my SD card. Cons: the app is too expensive and nags for a review with no way to opt out - so here's your review! Happy now?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth every penny, support the dev! This is really just the best choice for journaling that I can see on the play Store. I'm even using this more than Evernote. The coaching feature is an extra bonus and I'll really hope they keep it updated with new content. And it is not restrictive like other apps, good options for exporting and download images."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Have been using it since an year. Very useful. keep up the good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App to put your thoughts and anything else that may be on your mind. Good way to vent your feelings and grow as a person."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for lifetime but not able to actually access that across all my devices, apparently have to buy it twice (not gonna happen) to be able to use it on my phone and ipad. You should make this feature applied to the account not the app store purchased from. I would have given you 5 stars and recommended you to everyone, but since you're greedy I will not recommend you at all. Thanks developers! Really would have thought that lifetime purchase would apply to my account not to a specific platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great, easy, fast way to make special notes to remember special memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App seemed okay, but notificafions didnt work. Doesnt remind you to write in the app and easy to forget to ise...emailed for refund will update stars when that is processed as i cant be sure of support of the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey for a few years now and it is really easy to capture my day's information. I used to handwrite in a journal but injured my shoulder and wanted an electronic option. After trying several, I chose Journey and even paid for the liftetime membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I didn't use the app but they charged me for full year without asking for any confirmation. Don't take their free trail! They will charge you for annual membership without giving any reminder or option to change your subscription plan."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Feel very secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What I like about it is that my stuff get's to be saved via Google email,so lossing phone is not that much a problem I will still have my notes.😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, i like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple easy to use. I don't see myself using the premium features soon. But we'll see..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app. The reminders do their job, but they're not obtrusive or loud. And I like that there's no pressure for me to do this. Just the prompt that it's available for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've found, an interface that continually gets better and also the strongest cross-platform similarity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not really worth the paid portion of it, I felt scammed into buying pro, offered me a really discounted price that said if I left the screen that the offer will never be offered again. This was before I really got to try it, but the offer sounded nice so I went with it, they have a no refund policy. I liked the app overall just saying it's not worth paid, so if you're considering it, please make sure you want it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful experience. This app just have all I ever looked for in a journal. I used to prefer paper wiring but I have so much pleasure using Journal. Im snow stick to it. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app for journaling perfect if you want to get into it but dont have enough time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Gets the job done, but could be better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty useful for when you don't have time to sit down and write by hand."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app its awesome 5 stars! Unfortunately I deleted my old Google account and there doesn't seem to be any way to get back into my journey. Which is upsetting, but a great app anyway, highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like the app. User friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found this app several years ago after trying to journal using Onenote. This app has proved to be easy to use to keep track of my thoughts and feelings. Would love to see the option to create separate notebooks as I would love to have a separate space for notes and ideas for my business and blog, but the tagging feature helps to keep those entries segregated for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and does everything I wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good enough for what I need. It would be great to have modules that you could add about rating mood or something, then you could plot a graph over time. Just an idea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A nice app. Worth the small price. I do wish the dashboard was a little more intuitive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Wish they had a non google play version, since I cant purchase it via Google Play store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best journaling app i have used, I stopped using diaries in 2016. You can add photos, temperature and location."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far so good <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal App I love being able to update my journal from any computer, my phone, or my tablet. The prompts help me to write on days when I am not surewhat to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Especially the fact you can use your voice to do all the writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy the writing prompts and having a simple platform to write in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used it going on 3 years..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great way to write with privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app. I journal daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it. Thanks Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have been using the premium version of this for several years now. Just bought a new computer and even by signing in to my account, the newly installed version on my new computer keeps asking me to purchase the premium version. I already have. My understanding is that purchasing the premium version means you get the app across your devices, ie, you pay for your use of the app, NOT per device. I have been in contact with the maker without satisfaction. The app is great... but the deal is not truthful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Programmers need to be paid That's a fact of life and that's perfectly fine,im a programmer, But the way this program promotes itself, almost immediately trying to create a sense of urgency through""limited time pricing"", and push notifications before I even start using it, made it clear that this probably is not a program I want to be dealing with long term. Try to Sell me a premium version fine, Tell me to act fast or that time is limited or force push notifications into my feed.... No"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seriously thank you for making this app. I love it so much and its truly helping me on my personal growth JOURNEY wink wink ;) hahaha 💕💕💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It makes it easy to build the habit of journaling and it has enough different things to do to keep it fresh and interesting. I truthfully love it. I still write by hand in my journal but this keeps me better accountable to sticking to journaling daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good indeed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Bought lifetime premium yet the app continuously asks for more money for few months premium. Should have no ads after bought lifetime premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For years I used Notes apps to journal. But Journey changed that for me. The free offering is great, full of many useful features. It has the basics plus more, like jounraling prompts. My favorite thing is over that last 5 months, Journey has proven to be reliable/stable. My entries sync across my iPhone (iOS app) and Chromebook (Android app) without fail! One wish is for more info/assurance of privacy/security/E2E encryption. I trust it so far and use a passcode. I tried others; Journey is it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really good. This is my first Digital journal that i purchased and iam not disappointed by it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me track my behaviour."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is simple and perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have tried different apps for my daily journal, and Journey surpassed them all. Very user-friendly and top notch UI with very much needed features for a detailed journal like location, mood, media and more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tip top"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amaizing 😄"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Gets better and better with each iteration."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Your app is the best in terms of usability and I have purchased the membership but the Print version does not set the layout properly, I have tried it on the Daybook app, and they do it perfectly. Please make your app as minimal as Daybook, need some serious improvements in text format, too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice easy to use app only just started to keep a journal and like what I see"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My daily sanctuary. I used voice dictation to journal my life. It is a stress relief. Journey is my favorite of all journaling apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it almost daily to track my travel and hours worked"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This diary app is great, real safe place for me to work on my inner conflicts and problems and recording interesting events of my life. I have the for-life subscription and I'm very satisfied with it (I personally prefer pay once rather subscription, so it's great the creators offers this option). I also really like the extended editing features, including lists, text color, highlighting etc. The only diary you'll ever need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, but I wish they would shut up about getting the monthly membership after I've purchased the premium version of the app. It's incredibly annoying and I wouldn't mind it that much if it wasn't so in your face."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome because I can include pictures and add tags to sort my entries. I also love that I can type entries online using my laptop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. Really loved the atlas feature!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Little confusing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good, it's exactly what I was looking for to keep some thoughts in digital format. No issues!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. When adding more than 1 photo to a journal entry it will be a nice to have them displayed in a collage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app, I wish the premium or one time purchase was simpler and cheaper Thanks to the Developers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to develop a journal habit with reminders and prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, simple & easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Got this on a whim and it's been a life saver. When you have no one to turn to this helps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app seems to give me an outlet that's unavalable otherwise. Almost like another person to talk to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for months now and I cannot express how amazing it is. Definitely worth a membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Have it on 3 different devices and syncs well. I use it for all sorts from keeping record of animal training to holiday diary to personal development. Being able to easily access posts via calendar and/or tags is useful. I do with I could rename tags tho ... Maybe it is possible?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tidak ada opsi export csv"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome UX"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Able to journal and add pictures. Can sign in on any device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, haven't had a problem using it. I like having a journal always at my fingertips. I also like being able to attach documents, pictures from other sources."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use this everyday! I love that it's searchable in case I want to look up specifics of something that happened or somewhere I went later on, like a restaurant. Edit: it is HARD to export entries!!! I have entries dating back to 2017. I got a new phone and thought I could just sync everything from the cloud but only 2019+ entries synched. Had to sync in small batches - very tedious. Chat help on the website was responsive, which is nice. Still love the app functionality other than that though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this app! I left facebook as I realized the only thing I was enjoying about it was the memories feature...so now I use this app to store my memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep your thoughts for posterity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Paid for Lifetime Premium and can't fault it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would prefer better connectivity between platforms without them bleeding me dry with a monthly subscription, but I understand that they need an income to keep the service off the ground, so I don't fault them for that. The android premium service is certainly worth the one-off payment though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It doesn't have an expense tracker!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decent ap. Need purchase for premium features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It do not support pdf file, which is not fair"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and clean application for keeping a journal. I quite like the ability to also use it on the PC as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just me and my words. Exactly what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super love this app. Cant imagine how i can live without this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal is so therapitic. I have been trying to write a book for years. Journey Journal is helping me in gathering my thoughts and I can access it on my phone, tablet and laptop. I love that I can add pictures to my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been beneficial for me to make note of things as I 'journey' life's twists and turns. I use the free version and it's been good. I haven't seen the need to pay yet but if I reach a point where it will benefit me I will be willing to toss a couple $ at it. Since I don't use it during normal times it wouldn't be worth it to pay a monthly subscription. But it's perfect when trying to figure things out in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very simple to use, yet wonderful app as it has all the features needed! Using since 4 years and still happy to use!:-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best Journal app ever!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app works pretty well! Excellent job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best in it's category"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful to get hold of. Wont acknowledge a mistake which ended up in me paying £8 and then £28 for membership. Months I've been going round in circles. The app isn't that brilliant. I'd rather use a pen and paper. After all of this trouble I'm going to delete this app. Mega dissatisfaction.will never deal with again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's great for keeping yourself in check with your emotions throughout the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app, only thing I can think of that will make it better is if there was an option for a general dark theme. I know there is a night mode when writing the entry but an app-wide dark mode would be nice too. Would definitely recommend going premium. Best journaling app on android."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A brilliant app. Inspires me to write everyday. A great way to reflect on the day. It allows me to think about my goals and ambitions. Helps me to look back on my life and gain wisdom."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app love the calendar love it all I truly recommend this app to those who really wanna keep their privacy or want to vent about their day, this is truly a wonderful and very useful app to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the idea of this app and the premium features sounded like features I'd get a lot of use out of. With that, I decided I would subscribe to the premium (paid) edition of the app. Only to find out that I did not have the option to pay month to month. The only option is to pay annually. This would not be so bad -- if a free trial was offered and I could see if I liked the premium edition before having to pay it... for a year, up front. I am not usually one to complain but this was a bummer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal app I have ever come across."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy-to-use interface free web backup simple and effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Has password. They have fingerprint security. It's also easy to transfer your journal to a new device. I hope they would provide a way for descendents to gain access after I pass"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. If you would like to journal then this is highly recommended. Useable on phone and desktop. Reminders to keep the habit of daily input. You can change fonts add pictures locations etc Worth buying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free!!!!!!! Loaded with Ads. Wow!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easier to take notes in meetings on my tablet and then grab them via the webapp when on my PC. The ability to search all entries for keywords is really useful. The upgrade to the paid version is worth it, as it gives you the ability to format text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Enjoying coaching prompts of what to write about but lifetime premium unlocks some but not all coaching. Doesn't unlock the new year coach 😓 This was not clear when I paid - I wrongly thought it was the same as the membership but more upfront. I do like easy mood, location, weather and date tagging. Ability to add photos great too. Didn't like timed pressure to subscribe before checking it out much, and found the lifetime subscription likely to be much cheaper but was harder to find."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have never had an app that is so easy to use to journal. I love the way that it reminds you that you need to do it. The Gratitude reminders of which if I don't do it on this app I write them down the first thing when I get up out of the bed in the morning are great. They prompt you to remember and they also ask you questions. I am definitely going to purchase this app and I recommend it to all out there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App works great just wish I remembered to use it more 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Absolute scam, do not install. You will be charged $45.99 for a trial! I don't even use the app out of principal. I just want my money back, which seems to be impossible based on some of these reviews."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, I use it every day for poety"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to record life's special moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No way worth a subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice to be able to just jot a memory down with no hassle or fuss."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy and intuitive way to capture your life in words, pictures and video...awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary app in my experience. You can attach location, photo, video, mood, tag and many more to your records. You get charts, flashbacks and a map with the location of your records. It's just simply great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I NEED A REFUND! I did not mean to keep this app and never even opened it but i cannot see an info or contact website or number to call to request a refund and I cannot request refund through goodle play either because i guess i cancelled my supposed 'subscription' but now nowhere to request refund of $30 which is entirely too much to pay for an app like this but i didnt even get to use it so i cant say much regarding details of the app itself. I JUST NEED A REFUND ASAP! PLEASE CONTACT ME BACK!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app for tracking my health, my sleep patterns, food sensitivities, and just journaling. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Outstanding, this is such a good app, for taking notes about my day, and my mental health problems, would recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, easy to use, friendly reminders. Journalling helps me clarify my feelings before taking action. It's been great so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"5 stars ✨, if you help me to get the Coach thing completely turned off. It won't on my app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really loving this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for tracking your state of mind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app works well for me. I have just purchased the premium version, so we will see what all the features are."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app offers all the features you would expect. The app knows what day a picture was taken puts temp and has mood tracking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm new to running a journal, was old school, writing everything down... This is fantastic!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Password protected, easy to keep track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a few months now, and I really like it. It's easy to use and has quite a few features. The mobile version is very well developed and looks good, but the desktop version is not very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good journaling app. But after I save a journal, the indentation system keep printing bullet/numbering where I don't put them. It's been like this for a long time, whether in browser (Firefox, Chrome) or my phone (Android 8.1)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's always their when I need to write"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Strangely does not have the option for multiple journals (for different purposes or topics). Has 'mood charts' but does not offer the option to chart and track quantities of your choice. Forces you to opt in on a paid subscription which can't be cancelled via the app. Text editing options (layout, typography, mark-up) nonexistent. Can't import link previews from web links. Pretty much all these features are common in free or cheaper apps; not clear what you are paying for here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Easy to use. So far, I'm happy with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying this app. I wanted to start this year being a little more connected with myself and this app has helped with that. The prompts help on days that nothing comes to mind or of you want to focus on a particular topic. Love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little motivation and self love care."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Very easy to use. Good reminders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just read through all the critical reviews and from them I gather that they obviously have very poor customer service and continue to constantly ask you to upgrade. I get it. I downloaded the app and started to use it right away and loved it. So, I upgraded. I love that you can pick the font and size, you can use the web version (for when I am at a computer), you can pick the date you want to journal in, the journal prompts, and that you can have more than one entry on one day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it is very helpful,its very easy to use,its not cluttered with a whole bunch of things to go to,its simple and I really love it thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful and simple app. I wish there were more icons for bulleting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that I can include pictures"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app keep tracks of hours"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app... Would be good if you could integrate with Samsung health so my training would automatically add as an entry. Or integration with ifttt... But that's a nice to have 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Epic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to look bck to ur old memories 😅"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice journaling app. I only use it occasionally but have been using it for a very long time. Very straightforward. Good interface. Wish I could get the full version as a 1 time purchase rather than a subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had a motorcycle wreck and quite the brain injury several years ago. Remembering things is nice. Recording memories is one thing and retrieving them is quite another. This app is impressive on both fronts! I highly recommend it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, does exactly what I want, and for free! Would highly reccomend to anyone who wants to start journaling daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"convenient and easy way to capture my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great journal, but I would prefer more flexibility with tags"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Simple enough for me to write what's happening."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the journal I keep coming back to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A monthly fee for a digital journal... Come on.atleast be upfront about it, and don't hit me with a fee after I've already taken the time to set it up. That's not cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is brilliant because I can use it on my apple and android devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I have a secure place I can vent and write out how I feel. I don't have to worry if anyone will read it because it has an option to set up a password. I use it almost daily. It allows you to add photos, location and mood so you can track it and see how your month has been. Best app I have ever downloaded at least for me it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gosh this journal is amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best in the world"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps for journalling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so helpful in many ways"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"7 day trial only"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is awesome I am a Christian man I use it at church would like a way to do a grocery list but other than that it's great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Entertainment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app that I reinstalled on my phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So useful. I keep things in Journey that I need to refer to on a regular basis as will as my personal journal and poetry stuff. BTW- I have never upgraded, so I use the free version. It may not have all the nifty features and I do get a short sales pitch every time I login, but i just click ""No thanks"". I enjoy the bennies and don't have any of the headaches other people write about in their reviews."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using the paid version of this app for documentation for a LTB issue. It's great for pictures, date stamps, weather, location all the things you'd want from a journal / diary app in one package, all around diverse app. Amazing job to the creators."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Part of my everyday. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good journaling experience!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"These criminals are illigit. Sent emails over and over. Criminals app the $29.99 version ""editor's choice"" only let me set up the account and pay for it and never opened the premium annual version again. Sent lots of emails with lotsa info. Criminals were like a broken record, telling me to email them again requesting the wanted and warranted refund. Google Play ""couldn't"" do anything about it. Well for starters it makes me wonder who is greasing whose pocket. Editor or the developer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app. but need gmail sync. otherwise how the lost data or lost pw can be found ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the security Journey provided. Just kind of tired having to close the reminder especially when I'm in a hurry, but fortunately there's the widget that saves time for instant journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a very inspiring app keeping me connecting to my insight journaling. Great job !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been enjoying Journey for 4 years now and that in its self is remarkable as most apps never get this much attention. What I like, simple, easy on the eyes, the search and tag feature is very useful, ability to add images, weather, location to journal entries is a neat feature; I do however wish the backup and ability to print was just a bit more than it is, even as it is useful in its current state. I use my journey at least 5 times a week and the look into past notifications are cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for journalling! Everything you could ever need in a personal journal. Journey has been with me through the hard times and the good times and it's helped me through all of it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Three stars not because it's a bad app no it's amazing but three stars because you people had to go and change your timeout settings and now someone has been able to read most of my private thoughts just because a timeout of 0s didn't require fingerprint unless you close the app from the apps list. Please fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to the point. Gets the job done and well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that i can add pictures to the entry. Ive tried a few and this one is good. I wish i can voice record that would make it better. Having a calender helps too and location."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been the best tool to document my events and travels"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. I can use it either by writing, voicing or video."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I spend more time in this app in a good way, because I really like the online coaching and journal prompts. I only wish you had a way to make more than one notebook/journal or folder because I am always writing about more than one subject, my journal, my ancestry, my family history documents, my children, etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app all the way for all kind of people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My Buddy and Partner Forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, free version does plenty, love reading back over random thoughts from months and years ago. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I did not know there's a charge... Would of liked to try... But I read the reviews and I installed then Uninstalled... 😢"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect diary/journal app! Has free automatic backups to Google Drive. Also very easy and comfortable to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Приятное приложение. Ничего лишнего. Некоторые похожие приложения-дневники бывают перегружены всякими фишками, которые могут мешать главной цели - делиться своими мыслями."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Very Nice App And Very Usefull Long 4 Years im using this app 1 Of The Best App For me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I have started to write my thoughts and experiences but find writing on paper tiring and wasteful. I prefer writing digitally and this is so perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app helps me to express my deepest feelings and guarantees that it's safe and no one will get to read them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The most versatile journaling app than any other journaling apps I've know of.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Organized and integrated with Google. Support was helpful when I had syncing issues. I wish it could handle more/longer video entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple. Good for those who are minimalistic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever. The digital diary for all. Lot of features. safety wise it's best. More over best costumer support team. When some issues happened they responded back and resolved it so soon.. my advice, just download it. You won't regret.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I just started and I like it. It seems it has a lot of things to explore in application and in me with it. Interesting Journey ! Ask me in couple months...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Back up everything. This is what I need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keep track of your life and get the things that weigh you down out of your mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The simple design allows you to really flow with your thoughts. Cool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 star if it didn't nag you constantly to upgrade! Literally after every login and entry, it's do you want premium? No, OK how about annual membership? Special offer today only! (which is available repeatedly). Its as ""one time only"" as the DFS sale! I know it takes time and effort to make an app but when I decline the offers literally every day, get the message!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app for me as my memory is starting to go, and this helps to reassure me. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's not syncing. I am frustrated.. I am. Getting error b0501 EDIT they resolved the issue"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. Like, i absolutely love it. I can save my creative writings in it and not worry about using notes and then losing them. This app right here, i love it 👏🏽"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recommend this app all the time to people who want to start a daily practice of gratitude. Easy to use and fun to look back at old entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In memory Good records very organized"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for keeping a record of your daily thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tried it for weeks, thought this would make it easy to record thoughts and it is but only issue is after entering a journal entry the app does not return to home but rather closes out. Great for entering info quickly but reviewing journal entries is too difficult to be a functional replacement to default note app. Why not have a option to return to journal home page after entry.....it just closes out. Then you have to respond to see all entries.....so aggravating"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app is set up saying that the charge is 2.49 a month. But they charge it annually. When my 7 day trial passed I didnt think too much of it because I thought it is worth 2.49 to give this a 2nd chance. Though they charged the year amount and are not willing to honor a refund for the 11 months. The reason for 1 star is actually because there are other better apps that are 1 time fees (not subscription) It's good, but not for an annual cost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love this app. I have just suffered an Achilles tendon rupture and wanted to document my journey and recovery process. I may upgrade soon ...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Enjoy writting on Journey, it's really good but,had 1 request/suggestions to add Daily inspiration quotes to life time premium addon...Well,i appreciate everything but, please do think about the same..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps a clear record of time with a good number of ways to add to journal entries using photos, maps, file attachments of many types and a whole host of features that allow the diarist to tailor the journal to their own needs. Very interesting to begin a journal and attempt to keep it as often as possible, even if only visited occasionally over time it's surprising to see the story of the entries you made and forgot about completely! Highly recommended imho"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying it so far and like the benefits of keeping a journal. Key to starting the habit is not setting an expectation of length. Just write a few words a day and the entries will get more extensive in time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use with a lot of useful features which will help you understand the effect of the environment to your mood. I also love the media attachment feature. Like to suggest the developer to allow user to save the locations with name and let user select those saved locations rather than let use pick from the map, or allow both picking from map (GPS) and saved list would be very nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, because it renacts my thoughts in the reality of the moment. Giving me a mental visual of my thoughts and feelings. An things that I'm trying to do, as well as my goals and my dreams."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app describes itself as a path to a happier and healthier mind. When you first open the app, you get an aggressive hard sell where you are given 60 seconds to take advantage of a one-time offer which doesn't even tell you how much you are being asked to spend until you have given personal info. I mean, really? This might be the best app ever, but you destroyed my trust within 60 seconds. Great job devs!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is my therapy....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No entendi que fue lo que adquirí al desbloquear la app. De cualquier forma la estoy disfrutando. Gracias"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Before you can even try the app, it bombarded you with all sorts of deals to subscribe to. It csnt be a good app if it's purpose is to try and get money. At least give me a chance to try the app. Deleted with this rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App... Only change would be for the Preview screen that shows all the dates to show bold text as well instead of just showing inside the edit portion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent diary application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Never kept a journal before but this is a great way for me to one day go back and look at the process that God is taking me through."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent - have used this since 2017 and in a variety of countries. Stable cross-device functionality and simple easy interface. Well designed throughout. Recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app pesters you to upgrade. It's just not content that I have the free version, i simply must upgrade!!!!! Grrr. If it does it one more time I will delete it. So..... even when the developer replies to my review all they do is ask me to upgrade !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. I find it perfect to get into the habit of using a daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app indeed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I did not sign up for any subscription and it still charged me for a yearly subscription, dont waste your time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal I have tried a few and this one has all I need and more"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App works great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"journey is essential to my day. a source of inspiration. a place to store thoughts and ideas. a must have tool. thanks yall 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! I do love to write too in journals but this has helped me in so many ways. Thank you for creating this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice App to store precious times of Life.😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The offers are annoying, still popping up even after I bought lifetime license. Otherwise nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is so easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to put down my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful way to fill up my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this frequently, but dont get notifications until i open the app. Works perfectly and lifetime sub really is nice. Just the reminders to use it at the specified time i set would be nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary app I have ever used after trying out different apps. The interface and updates are quite nice especially the tags because this makes it even easier to organize the inputs. I paid the lifetime premium for both android and Windows and it was worth it! Truly recommend this. Keep up the great work :) Another function that is worth mentioning, which makes me love the app more, is the throwback entries. Nice to reminisce sometimes haha!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this journaling app. Simple in design yet rich is options. Well done"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the features available and the ability to lock the journal. User friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy it it's easy and free :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday and that is a first time!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the ease and privacy with which I can document my thoughts and ideas. And that I can do so both on my phone and the computer. Excellent app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yas"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good enjoyed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Well, when I saw there was a 7 day free trial before continuing, I didn't click the Continue Button. Instead I pressed the x thus removing the notification. I Then deleted the app. Does this cancel the free trial automatically ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy the app and am just using the free version. It would get 5 stars if it didn't constantly pop up with a barrage of ads to try and get you to pay. I understand encouraging people to sign up but having to close through all the pop ups on opening is a drag. Obviously if I declined the offer I'm not going to change my mind 4 seconds later. Otherwise great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi this app is really great but i have a problem. so i think the app had been updated automatically, and when i opened it yesterday i lost all my journal entries in the new update. It's as if it's just been installed. Please help those entries are important"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply fantadtic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Monthly subscription for a glorified notepad. Joke"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice for making journal/diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is really good. The interface, the quickness of jotting down a quick thought; it's all so fluid. Honestly, (for a mobile app) I can't think of much that is flawed. There's plenty of room to grow and expand. I'd like to see a ""list"" feature added for groceries, budgets, things of that nature. Other than that, great work!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Quis aproveitar a opção de 50% de desconto e me surpreendi ao ver que não é possível criar mais de um jornal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect diary, I can go back and read beautiful memories and also see the pictures from that particular moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. Your thoughts, feelings, everything you write is kept private. There's no ads, or at I least I never experienced any."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps for journaling. Very user friendly and easy to use, and simple in what it does. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You'll have your journal with you wherever you go, mobile or desktop. It is always synced, always backed up, and offers a beautiful layout and multitude of tools while remaining inherently simple all at once. Download Journey, even consider subscribing if you think you'll enjoy the additional features as I have. You won't do better than this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app collected membership fee without consent/warning. Absolute cheating Not satisfied with the reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"EDIT: I’ve taken off a star for 2 reasons. 1. The end of every month, I like to export a pdf with all the entries I’ve made that month. When I select the dates of a month (ex: 01.01-01.31), it exports a pdf that’s missing the last few days (ex: exports 01.01-01.28). To compensate, I overshoot my export (ex: 01-01-02-03) to get the desired selection exported. 2. I’ve gotten a few time hops of entries that were created last month, yet Journey thinks they were made last year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so worth it even on its free version! Really useful when you cannot consistently journal using actual paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Purchased in 2015. Has been a great app and gets better with each update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! A great way to input all my daily musings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app, that's easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for the spiritual journey I am on now!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am having great time with this help... i fell i am telling my stuff to someone by writing things down in this app... i would relly suggest this to everyone..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. The more I use it, the more features I find it has. The one time I did have an issue/question. Live support handled in less than a few minutes. This was and is a good investment that I will keep."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very simple, nice interface n layout , can add images n wht-nots"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just so easy to use. Can't wait to read my entries from a year ago!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"""trial"" is not free! As I installed the app a pop up shows up saying you have 7 days trial, but after approving, I was immidietly charged FULL PRICE of a year subscription. Add to that when the app loads you get a notification for 50% off but of course since I was already charged full price I'm not eligible. Then a 3rd popup shows on to prompt you to sign for premium content -- all of this before I even opened the app and got to try it!! Bad practice, I would like a refund"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fluid. Functional. Fabulous. Thank you! 🌸"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Immediately after download. Told me it was a trial. I immediately uninstalled. If you can't be upfront I don't want to know about it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it. I've been wanting to keep a journal...this is easy and convenient!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Tried 3 other journaling apps, this one was the best. Liked it so much I bought premium within a week. I'm actually journaling again! Love the pin code option. I wish it had the voice option, but maybe I just don't know how to use Google Assistant yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"What ever happened to FREE apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app to keep track of daily activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it Easy user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I had this app before and had to Uninstaller on my old phone due to space constraints. I got it back now on a new phone but can't seem to get my old account on it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very solid, easy to navigate. The UI doesn't get in the way of writing, and the sync feature works flawlessly so far. Being able to sync with the Mac app and also the iOS app is a major time-saver as well. Definitely a keeper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that it's as simple as a tap to make a time stamped entry with so many additional useful features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good, only thing is that it sometimes forgets which coach session (no idea what it is called 😂) I am doing so I have to start again"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is the best in it's class. All of the automatic notation makes daily snapshots a breeze. All you have to write is your thoughts, the app catches the time, location, weather, etc. However, it does absolutely bombard you with ""Go Premium"" popups. Even if you take them up on the offer, it still has OTHER pop-up offers, so when you finally fork over your money it doesn't even stop the damn popups."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful in recording my day to day activities with utmost ease i am using it to note Yoga asanas minute by minute. Excellen and useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good experience but pics sirf 4 upload hosakti h jo k ghalt h zyada pics ka opxn hna chahye"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I do love this app, however unfortunately I had to pay for the Premium membership twice which is a tad annoying. Having said that I do love journaling and adding photos🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself is fantastic, there could be some more options for mood tracking and better statistics. But what bothers me the most is the ads and upgrades that get thrown at you every second. I gladly buy your premium version, but for gods sake let me please first actually try the app. Plus, stop with those nonsense discount sale offers that literally have the same price as well as non discounts. Its just silly, If i like your app I will buy it. But out of protest i wont."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing App. I have been using it for a little while and it keeps on surprising me by making my life easy to keep notes. Thanks a lot to the developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not snappy, diary with planner will help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Versatile and private. Formatting and accessibility features sets it apart from other apps of the same type. Would be nice to have a template function within the app on the mobile. Very happy. Well done developers. I am sure you will keep on bringing even better features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I like the throwback reminders, nice to have a quick way to refresh your memory of the recent past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I do enjoy using this app. The interface is nice, clear and works very well. Many thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I like this app. I don't like being charged double what I paid for the first year without any notice.... How is this legal? Have cancelled subscription. What's to stop them charging a few hundred next time. This is a useful app. I don't mind paying. I do mind being fleeced and not informed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its very good.. Nice xperiance"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"BUYER BEWARE! Two App marketing is shady. Pop ups gave me a special, 19.9o instead of 39.90 for a year. But it said if I left the screen the offer was gone. I paid for a year. After pymt. A new screen said a ""LIFETIME"" of using journal was only 11.?? . Less features but all I needed. I emailed Two App, who refused to change me to lifetime status. I asked again, told to send a billing ticket. No answer, so I texted again. A new email says ""no answer?"" ""probably refused. Try again"""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice for taking our daily notes,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful. Neat UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great personal journaling app. Excellent formatting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"My experience was awful. They have two confusing demos, neither of which I wanted. I requested a refund after accidentally getting some subscription started and they made me email, fill out a form, email again, and then denied the refund. They intentionally jerked me around for 5 days. Expect terrible customer service, a confusing mess of an app, good luck trying to figure out how to not get charged $29.99 when you click ""no I don't want that."" They'll charge you anyway and waste your time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well made, and well thought out app. Took me a while to get the habit going, but I would encourage anyone to do some sort of Journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Invigorating thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i like this app a lot especially features like tags and attachments, but really want to be able to add more than one image at a time, when taking photos. instead of going back to the entry every time. also i wish the formatting had more features, with its own menu; also i want to see the formatting (eg italics) but i don't want to see the markup symbols. Updated 13/1, would like to rearrange the order of images (attachments), and rotate images (attachments) within the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to have this diary for notes in carrier path"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The option to record your voice is essential to me. This is the only app I've seen that can record, though that's only in the paid version. It has a lot of ads, but only for the app itself, and not while you are writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Tried to get me to sign up and pay before I even had a chance to try the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app! I use it to journal when I'm reading the Word of God, its awesome! Its unlimited how many entries I can input them in as well, alot of cool options, havent looked at all the things that they have to offer on the app, but it is great as well. I definitely suggest this app to use and even purchase. Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good but, stop pushing me to go to pro version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am going to try this again"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A user-friendly, reliable journalling app with a simple, clean interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love don't use it often as I should"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Can't sign in to my Google account it keeps saying no internet connection please fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great diary app. Been using it a long time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Wish the membership pop ups weren't so persistent. I just want the basic features for now. Maybe once I've gotten into a habit I might unlocked them but let me use it for a while so I can make.up my mind if I want the extra features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Keeps asking constantly for money/payment....why draw people onto this app if it's not free!! At least specify at the beginning before we install it !!! Save's the hassle"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible. There was no mention of price. But as soon as I downloaded the app, you scheduled 29.99 plus to come out of my checking account in seven days. I never tried the app. Uninstalled it asap and I better not get charged. Just be upfront and stop trying to scam people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The add + button should be available straight away. Only thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app very easy to use! Thankyou"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"A bit pointless"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Funny"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Totally worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was a great app, it motivates me, journaling in this app, to record my life moments or just simply writing my random thoughts. I love the world map function and can't wait to expand the map to further."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful place to store your thought and then revisit another say."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it, it's the first journal app that I stay motivated to use. Love the customization, being able to keep track of my highs and lows, I love seeing throwbacks and seeing how far I've come. My only complaint and why I can't give five stars is it will constantly bombard me with ads to buy the premium, but I already bought the premium and it still shows me ads for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is a companion for everyone. Without any doubt, it'd changed a person's old lifestyle to another level. Love it <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use! I use it to keep track of moments in my kids' growing up. Love that I can attach photos to my commentary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just started using the app but, so far, I really enjoy it. I love the options and versatility it offers the writer. I can add photos, locations, weather, etc... to my posts that really give them an upgrade. Five stars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I got this app about two years ago. Just to write down my thoughts and maybe what happend that day. It helped me differentiate the days so it didnt all just blend and I wouldnt forget important things that I was thinking or doing at that time. I recently got back into it and looking back on my ""journey"" from 2 years ago is extreamly surreal and intresting. WORTH GETTING AND WORTH THE MONEY"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great that it syncs with other devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Put it out front that you charge for this app. I like it but that is deceptive. Loving it loading it and then finding out that you are going to charge me. Not cool. I love the layout, but I felt a tad scammed. So even though I can afford it I wont be purchasing it for that reason."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exellent Journal... If I were an app developer I would have my intellectual properties from this monatized and route my money to holdings... If it were me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app a lot. Very easy to use, nice features. The one thing I wish it did allow was some sort if text emphasis....either bolding or italicizing would be nice. UPDATE 1/9/2020: Thanks for listening! Love the ability to add text emphasis and colors. Still 5 stars going strong!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've loved using this so far this year. It's really helped me keep on top of how my days have been going and I can't wait to look back on it all in the future. I also like that you can add photos to each day, it's a lovely little memory bank!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so helpful to have access to my entries & I love having them so secure. I pay for the upgrade and it is definitely worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journalism and also trains you how to journal 😃"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using Journey for a few months now and I'm very impressed cannot fault it in any way and I've been using it for 6 years now and it's amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Get ads after paying for lifetime. I don't have a problem with paying. Heck I pay patreon to all the developers who I use daily. Android and Linux. The huge difference is that I do not get ads after buying their software. I do not want or need the subscription. Which came about after I paid full price for this app. I had moved away from this app but like the GPS tagging. Considering moving again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Must recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App with most nag screens to update. Just don't offer a free version!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has really simplified my journal because before I could not always make entry when it was fresh making it difficult to keep accurate time and date for the entry. The app allows me to make entry as it occurred insuring accurate time and date for the event, thought or situation entered."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I could pour out my heart here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app seems well put together and nice but I've never seen such predatory (and poorly timed) conversion tactics in an app before. 60 seconds before an offer runs out on a sale for an app I'm just now using for the first time? A discount that's only available before dismissing it the first time--again after I've hardly used the app? C'mon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wow you gotta pay for it monthly? Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, Practical and Flexible for its purpose. Most important, Its simple and it works. It's exactly what i wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's really helpful. one thing need to be improve is managing tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not sure if I happy with it yet, keeps asking me to up grade, I've paid for a year and I paid for the (I did not remember name) but forever fee. It keeps asking me to up grade, it shows I'm a annual user but it needs to to remove any advertising even there own!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! The dark mode and the whole presentation is what sold me. The photo displayed at the top of each entey really appeals to me, since I am a photographer. I would recommend getting the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great app, but be careful before you buy. Buying the premium app on android does NOT allow premium on windows. You will have to buy that in ADDITION to the android app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was offered the full year for $8.99, then was charged $32.99. Canceling subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to write journal . Life journal. खूप खूप छान अॅप आहे . सोप्पे आणि सतिक ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Solid app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Fantastic App but wasted my money. The journalling portion is great. I signed in on both android and iOS and thought my account transferred. Boy was I wrong. I purchased the premium content on Android and then found out despite having the same account on both devices that my premium content would NOT transfer and they will NOT refund. Now I'm paying twice the amount for one device I only ever needed it on iOS and bought for Android now I will be paying twice. Developers should mention this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"3 stars because i cannot access fonts/colors without purchasing journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I am disappointed that even after using the subscription model there is no grammar check. Plus the lifetime subscription is only for mobile not for windows. They don't explicitly tell you that before buying. But the app is good overall. Thus the rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, both here and on my win10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Some bugs with the editor and video plus photo restrictions are negative. Everything else is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really really like this, gives me the option to add my mood as well as writing as much, or as little as I want. Ads are mildly annoying but easily rectified by purchasing it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App for keeping your info safe I am a lifetime member. It's worth every cent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you😀😁😂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Its very confusing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for keeping a life journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple. Easy to use. Use as a diary to vent or -for those who like to learn from their past- for recording the thought process behind key moments/decisions in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this. app alot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good but it really wants you to spend money so much it's annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is very reliable whether you are connected to the internet or not. In a day to day use, ..just type in any word you want to in the search box and it will pop the notes that were made by you not withstanding how long it is.There are no forgotten issues of not remembering what happened in your life as long you write them in this application!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great for me. Simple interface, equally easy on the website and the phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stupid app doesn't do what it says"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems good so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sweet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So far I like the app, it's perfect for what I need. However, I signed up for the free trial and I still get a message every time to upgrade! So what exactly is the free trial?! Am I still going to get these messages once I start paying?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The premium membership pop up messages are horrible. The rest is very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My everyday go- to app where I can release my thoughts! Easy to use, handy, simple. Download this app if You want to level up your journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy with the character space, I haven't been limited so far at least, and for the ease of use. I like the pop up reminders you can set. I like the ability to add entries into the past when you may have been too busy at the time to make an entry. I like that it is backed up safely, and the history transferable to new devices as needed. I like beimg able to add details like photos to the entries. I like the throwbacks to memories. Overall very happy with the app and would recommend it to others"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I need. Simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really helpful and very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like everything that I've discovered about this app. so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use...used it as a daily journal for my book"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary ever!!!! 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good layout and private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been 3 years with journey. I love it so much. I've tried plenty journal but this one works best for me. They got what i want. A journal where i can attached picture every entry. Just like you're posting on ig but its totally private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!! I've been journaling since I've been very young. I feel it's therapeutic. Now, I can journal anytime I want and have everything in one place, not several journals. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and good UI"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but now, they tell you that you should upgrade every time you open the app. Also, this app charges for the ""Night mode"" feature, something that comes for free with most apps that have the feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the reminders or simple.emoji to rate the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Where I keep log of daily happenings that i want to remember"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I wanted out an electronic journal. With use of hashtags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Like it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful app for remain memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, bought the lifetime membership !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using almost a year now. I love every part of it. I just started a membership because it is so great. Prices are worth it. I hate that the only one with prompts is monthly though :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple yet functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great journaling app that has all the options you could ask for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's what I've been looking for. Need SD card installation though. App starts taking up a lot of space after sometime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the app so I got the full version. The only disappointment is that you can't attach multiple different media's to a post. For example, if you want to add a voice recording , you can't add a picture, you have to choose between which one you want and I value both of these things highly. I would give 5 stars easily if that change could be made."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would love to see more options for activity and an integration with google photos!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perviously rated 4 stars due to not being able to change my icon. Once I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, my picture updated. It's a good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for more than two years now and i love it, i am a simple person and i love its simplicity. I wish they could add an option for title entry and folders though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very functional, gets what I need to done, and is very easily used"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Helps you with everything life has to tbrow at you. Excellent diary alone. So many great features. Definitely 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how well-made this app is. It motivates me to start journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The editing experience is very fluid and enjoyable. The content part of it, the ""Today"" section, is a little bit confusing. I find really useful the ""x years ago"" cards."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The only thing that's really lacking is the ability to create custom journal templates on mobile. I'd even pay extra monthly for this feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a really great clean and polished app, I love the google drive sync. If you don't purchase the premium version, prepare to be nagged a lot. The pricing is a little high for what it is, though I eventually caved and purchased it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been very helpful for jotting down quick blurbs of thoughts and emotions. I like that you can tag posts so you can find them later. Handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First time ive used something like this. but Seems good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it's really good and saves my entries. I know that if I have to switch a device that they will be in my new one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, had it for a few years on and off. Got me really productive during the times that I was consistent. I really dig that it was a one time purchase for premier and not an annual subscription. worth ever penny. Only gripe is that I can't group the types of journal entries any more. Maybe I am mistaken, but I believe I used to be color categorize and group each entry by Topic. Guide me to that information or re implement it and I will gladly bump this up to a 5 star rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so handy for jotting down thoughts and notes, full journal entries and saving bits and pieces from my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Having problem with the dark theme update in realme phone ,dark theme or night mood it is always on there is option to turn on or off night mood but it is locked because i don't have the subscription, i am not able to see what is written in my journals, i only able to see the emojis which i had used but not the text ,i had to edit the written journey ,for reading purpose 😐the brightness of the journal is too low ."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! I would give 5 stars if pre-defined templates were available in mobile like they are in the desktop app. I would also like to define my own templates. Keep up the great work, I think this is probably the best journaling app on the market now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is easy to use. gives daily access to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app on the app store for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great tool to remember past events with your own thoughts and feelings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and easy to use although Itvwould be nice to be able to add more than one image per day..... Or link it to an album or collection on Google or Flickr. . Bur really it's not a big thing...... the writing is, and it makes that pretty easy. I've tried to use various diary apps before but I think I'm gonna settle on this for quite a while Since my last review I haven't bee using it as much as I should. HOWEVER it's 2020 so making a big effort to ""restart"" a regular diary. Still looks the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I wanted an app to begin journalling and this looked perfect. However, the experience was irreparably tainted when, from the very start, it pushed me to subscribe. First at full price, then a very pushy (and slightly threatening) half price offer, I also noted that the half price offer did not come with a 7 day trial (cynical). I attempted to explore and make my first entry only to be prompted to subscribe 5 more times. At that point I felt this was too much for me and I uninstalled. Very sad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app was listed as free journal. Once downloaded and set up it said 7 day free trial. False claims are not well received."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app i like the way that ur thoughts are PIN protected Rather than a regular diary and amazing part of having a coach with annual subscription to prompt more journals and mood tracker and tags and add photos are my favs!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I want to love it... I really enjoy the layout of the app, and the ease of using it. However, I've owned the free version of three days now, and I've been trying to upgrade to the premium version and it won't allow me to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A must have diary or journal. Very neat, simple and light weight app. I give five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love this app a lot, so much that I've purchased a premium membership. Even so, syncing across different devices does not work and the paid membership doesn't translate over to other devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is helping me through dark times .. and it has become a daily routine to help clarify my thoughts and make me self aware without the cloud of emotions . I would recommend journalling to anyone period and this app is worth every cent of the subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I keep coming back to this app, and it keeps surprising me with just what I want and almost nothing I don't cluttering up the screen and functioning. Update: Almost four years on, and Journey has only gotten better. Streamlined, visually appealing UI, greatly improved cross-platform sync, and they have continued to honor the lifetime membership one-time IAP. Awesome job! Please, keep it up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Am really enjoying the ease of journalling using this app as well as the coach prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great I can write In my Language Again. 💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid User Review: Was great until the whole UI changed. Now experiencing all sorts of bugs. Losing journal entries and having to rewrite them. Editor is really terrible, hard to copy and paste, line spacing is broken, attached photos don't always work, and tag system is clunky. UPDATE: Text editor still broken. Copy and paste drops 3 spaces between lines, selecting text does not work well, moving cursor causes text editor to jump around making difficult to make simple entries. Do not bother."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's good but like Facebook cause my cause of writing comes with it and gets it's position out in the world that's it's not met. There is no personal life anymore on paper is invaded to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. I never buy apps but this is the only one that I actually paid premium for. But I don't get why i still get ads. I still love writing in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy Interface and Plenty of Features. Works Perfectly for me. I have subscribed for the year at the the offer price and use it on all platforms. Sync is seemless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good usefull app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been through several apps for writing daily schedules, making lists and for reminding myself of important things. I need a lot of help being organised and this app with a few others has helped to keep my life running smoothly. It's been vital that I can tag entries and organise what I'm writing with headings and text colours, for visual aid. Purchased the lifetime premium after a few months of using the app. No complaints!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"On the surface, this journal app is good. I was intrigued by the lifetime premium upgrade options (the constant ads for this were also annoying me) - so I purchased it. You would have thought spending £7.99 would remove ads from an app right? Wrong! I was now bombarded with ads for monthly/annual membership! The difference between membership and premium was never explained when purchasing premium, and I definitely would not spend additional ££'s per month/year for what is quite a simple journal app. I wrote to the support team and requested a refund but they have denied me one. Bad customer service, bad salesmanship. Total waste of time and money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use.🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"How do i pay for this app by using a google play card?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy having it for Bible verses and things I want to remember!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy with this app. Like that free version syncs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful application for me 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great cross platforms"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very useful and functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep your motivation up and happy thoughts on a line and unwind t9 be k8nd."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The App asks to upgrade even for making the text bold (formatting) No mode to capture handwritten notes (using a s-pen)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app making me reflect on my day to day life as well as look back to things that has happened to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. I like the sync feature..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have always enjoyed journaling ever since high school. I have been used to the good old paper and pencil which has its on benefits. However, the biggest con to me a paper and pencil is that it is difficult to preserve and easy to lose. Also, you cannot refer to it at last you are right next to it. This app allows me to journal anywhere and at any time knowing that all my work is in one place. Plus it has a ton of other great features oh, but you can read about that in the description."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Disappointingly bloated with features I don't want and have no use for. It's just my taste, but I want something more minimalist"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good but kinda pricey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super, Best app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app but too expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. This is the only app that I actually use to journal. The reminders are nice and I like the tags and being able to attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If there's something which can be a true companion and an awesome wardrobe for saving memories, it's JOURNEY !! Lucky me I purchased the Lifetime membership at a mind-blowing price. Enjoying the benefits to the core. 🤩🤩😍😍🤗🤗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😎Nice layout, cool functions, night mode, been using for a year. Would recommend.🔥 i also use it track some of my 🌊CodingPhase💎🍞 progress as well. Its very nice looking back at my journal journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal entry app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and has helped me immensely with journalling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Forcing users to pay to export our journal entries might just be illegal. This is our own data and we should have full control of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App... I desire that journey include option of re-mind /Alert of journey after year so i can re joy moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I been using Journey for almost 5 years now. I just love how simple it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Used this on my old mac, I bought a new mac and have tried to use it on that and is asking me to pay. No way to say sign in here instead. Not great as i am stuck now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have this app for years and it has never failed me. Great easy daily note keeper for personal or work. Mine tends to be both."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Wonderful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Doesn't tell u the app costs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is worth every penny! It really is beautiful and gorgeous. Love it very much. I was unable to resist buying the lifetime version of the app! I had tried various other apps in different devices, but could not find any other applications packing in such features as this one. Though people complain that the free version is bad, and nags you to purchase it constantly, if you are serious about journaling, then this is the app to get right now. It does have limits, but still worth it. Enjoy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Love the app. Soo easy Soo pure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that it sends me reminder to write in it😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I paid for the lifetime premium membership in order to use the audio recording feature. It works fine (although I'm limited to record only for 10 minutes), but I'm a bit disappointed in the design. It would look much better if the audio player is just one straight line instead of a big boring image of a musical note."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super easy to navigate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"(Paid version, Android device, no cloud) Simple to use. This app makes daily writing a breeze. Please add an ""auto save"" feature and allow me to edit the time for an entry. The location markers are clumsy to change. Please allow reordering of photos I attach to an entry. I enjoy all these features, just polish them a bit. P.S. Correction. Yes it does automatically save. Yes, I can edit the time and date for an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient way to journal! I love that it syncs with my phone and computer so I can access it anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always comes in handy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I really like the app, but the in app purchases are confusing and frustrating. Be sure to check and see that your getting the features you paid for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Been using it a very long tyme n love journaling. Thank you ♡♡♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"(Nice application but sometimes pictures taken by camera can not be saved ,also tags cant be deleted once created) this is solved , thank you . Still no dairy app is in competition with journey. It is simplest and very excellent moulded app. But i have one problem since 3, 4 years for that i have contacted journey team also . Tags which we have created can not be deleted . I am not talking about tags in notes . Tags in library can not be deleted .which is the only draw back of app. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Good app but keeps uninstalling premium than asks me to pay again. It's so annoying that I paid for a year to use this app and than it doesn't apply the premium. And than gives me ads to buy premium for less than I originally paid. It is so freaking annoying!!!!! I wish I could get my 39$ back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying the app! The ""throwback"" reminders are great for recalling where I've been! 💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing journalling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good journal app with very soothing smooth interface. Has premium services in a paid version as well. Provides backup for all entries. Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used a lot of journals. This one is the best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had the lifetime premium for years and love it. It has helped me in MANY different situations. It would be great if there was a ""quick add"" for mobile, as i log a lot of stops throughout the day. Also, ""frequently used tags"" would help, as I have tons of tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You have no one to talk to when I have an issue. I hate your app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!! Easy to use and navigate.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love ...love this app. The convenience of just writing my thoughts down by a click of a button."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Do want to investigate more about your app and dont mind to be a subscriber for its good. But it is a bit interesting that ur 50% off offer only available at first sign in, without giving a chance to new users to understand what they are going to purchase. Maybe this is a good app but the sales mechanisum is definitly a disaster. Please reconsider your way approaching new customers. Fyi - uninstalled already."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works as advertised. I'm satisfied."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I like being able to add pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app that I have ever seen. It is perfectly intuitive. I highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, so easy and pleasure to use and look back on the fun memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. It's not perfect. But, then, who is, right? :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like all the options Journey has such as the weather at the time of the entry and the location. I also like that I can sync it across my devices including my computer. I've had no problems with it at all and I use it frequently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Kinđa good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing down your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. The UI is very simple and beautiful however, some more features could be added for premium users like me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ashsome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love I have this app on both my iPhone and android tablet and it has been awesome. Let's not forget the desktop version! Highly recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, have yet to try out all the features, like looking pictures to days and getting reminders"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the thing that it's supposed to do . I'm happy with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great place to journal or do a nice stream of conciouness, or whatever you want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I dont need to pay for a journal or journaling. I can use one of the free ones. You dont know you have to pay for it til u set it all up. Then oh by the way you have to pay over 2 dollars to use it and they charge you annually. No thank you. You should charge upfront or say in your description that your going to charge an annual fee of $30.00."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great! I love this app for what it's for of course but more than that the simplicity! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app. I lost my device, but it was saved on the cloud. Very happy, I use it as a Journal, and there's nothing bad to say about it. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Good app, but extremely invasive/predatory ads on every single open of the app. Ive purchased the Windows version of the app so I can write comfortably, which is good. However the popups on the Android app are insane. The banner at the bottom is fine. 20191228: Just updating my review. I went and bought Lifetime Premium on the app so I can 'support' and go ad free. I STILL GET INVASIVE ADS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. STOP. I ALREADY PAID FOR WHAT I NEED. I ALSO BOUGHT WINDOWS JOURNEY APP"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app that has really enabled me to focus my thoughts and start keeping a record of my life. How many apps genuinely improve your life? Download it today and start improving yourself! 😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still new to the Journal keeping idea, but I really like this product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app and allows me to journal how I need to! Highly recommend! Also has a pun to get in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent its helps a lot in my life👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always a fun way to keep notes and timeline memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"good journal app to type whatever you feel like for that day it has alway run well unlike another one i have tried but I removed 2 stars and this is down to their flash sale/special offer etc every time it has come up with something along the line of hey join premium and get 50% off for the year. but once i click on it to see it only shows 40-46% depending on any given day once it was at 30% when it said 50%. Issue is still on going and have screen shots to prove it bit of false advertising."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty cool to keep a diary this way. Works well.. easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The ad for upgrade should be less often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've ever used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good job , but plz keep location recognise by Google map !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simple and intuitive. I could do without the subscription, but purchasing the premium would make it more robust."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, a wonderful way to record random thoughts and revelations and inspirationals that would otherwise be lost! I am loving this Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I joined recently and subscribed for a year. This app is a wonderful way to keep track of thoughts, feelings, events, and track mood. I enjoy the reminders, and am better at using the app than any other journal mechanism I have tried."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's ok but i don't use it. How do i cancel?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's just the little push I need to stick to my journaling everyday. I enjoy it's mood charting features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. Gives me the best platform to reflect upon life. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, highly functional"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I havent experienced anything negative. Been using short of a month."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After only a couple days off use I signed up. Great program."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app helps keep me up to date"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Making hash taged words into gigantic text is a bad idea. Please change it back or at least give us the option to undo so hash tags appear in normal font, thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Once you realize how powerful words are then and only then can you truly create your life. This is truly a Priceless gift!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent for daily journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have a premium membership but had to factory reset my phone & I don't remember the email address. Is there a customer service that can assist? I actually love Journey but I hate I lost so much information and I'm still bring billed 😭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice way to keep in touch with yourself. User friendly with great prompts and aides."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app to cherish your memory"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome little app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use it almost every day since 2016. It's so good. I keep my journals, my memories with photos... But the support for Indian languages like Malayalam and Hindi is very bad... Sometimes I can't get the exact word which I'm typing... But those words works fine in notes...!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! Very easy to use, I like the temperature and Geo tag to go along with my photos. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, even the free version is amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dont know what id do without journey now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, but can't seem to be able to upgrade to premium. Have been able to do so now, was a bank problem. Thanks for the response But we need additional text formatting features please eee! The only thing I can see is bold ,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for me to remember my reality show or my life as most people know what the things are happening to them in reality if they can do something like this in reality or something that I am going to be Able to do and I will never forget about anything else again but it seems to help me with this kind of thing I think it's important for me to do that Which means I can know what I mean disturbing to yesterday's day please don't want to be safe without any idea how to make the journey! It's great?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst app google ever recommended. Paid for annual subscription that ended up being worthless. Thanks for nothing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps things noted and synchronized for data back ups.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is really good, I like it. I miss the multi-media posts - sometimes you'd want to record something and add a photo for one post."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It gives you reminders when you have pics that may need to be added, without driving you crazy. It gives you options for almost anything you could need to keep a real journal. I actually do better with this than a real one. I can't say enough about it. I loved it so much, I signed up for the paid year subscription. Don't get me wrong, the free was awesome too. I used it for a few months before deciding to subscribe. You won't regret this download!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had the app for about 1 week and so far it's awesome. I was looking for a product that I could use on my MAC and my Android and this so far has worked great on both. Syncing is pretty darn quick once I save my entries. Since this is an e-journal it's great to add updates in the middle of the night without turning on the light and searching for a pen and a regular journal. It's really convenient when you want to document dreams. 👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Downloaded the app and paid the lifetime premium on my android phone. When i installed the app in the ipad pro, there's no problem with syncronization but it doesnt show that I purchased the premium. It prompts me to upgrate to premium instead. CAan you help fix this issue?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal anyone can have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ใช้ดีถูกใจมาก แต่ยังไม่รู้ว่าเก็บข้อมูลได้มากแค่ไหน"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Surely the best Journaling app I've ever used"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I hate in app ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome application , you must have this app for daily journaling. Great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I try to journal every day and having this app on my laptop and phone is very convenient. I love being able to add pictures and that is has a built in location report. My only complaints are that if you purchase the pro version (which I did) you only have that version on the device that you purchased it on. Also, the app will not rotate to lanscape on my cell phone, it always stays in portrait mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It gives u a virus"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Just began.....Hello 2020 I am ready to journal and grow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Solid journaling app. I've journaled a lot more since getting the app because it is so easy to use. They are a little pushy with their membership subscription, but the app and the service are really good. I definitely recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helping me keep track of my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So nice to be able to talk to myself in a secure environment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app.can sync online.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, has a night mode that is easy on the eyes. Love the prompts that come with coach in premium membership. The free stuff was good, but I love being able to add an entry via email. Makes life easier and is helping to keep me on track for some of my goals. Throwback feature is nice so I can see the improvements I have made."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, premium membership is worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it, i hope we can have more than one audio recording and video per entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek and attractive!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I already use it for three years. And today is the day where I can't help myself to purchase the lifetime version. I really love the app. An easy note taking app, cool interface, and great features. Many thanks to the developer. I would like to suggest you guys to provide more theme. Not only a mere colors but with icons and shape. You know what I mean right? Lol. Just love the app. Thanks journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"매우 만족스럽다."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to be productive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is well-designed, easy to use and to adapt to your own needs. The tags function is particularly useful. I also looked at the web app and note that you can't change the date there. Thank heavens you can do it on the mobile app - I'm always wanting to write entries for the day before."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, just wish the ads were less invasive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"giving 1 star for very irritating Upgrage to premium"" suggestions! every time they just want to upgrade to paid version!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary ever being using it for years its easy and awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app still needs time to mature and is probably best at fee paying level but even at basic level it has nmbr of awsum feature that make it stand head n shoulder above the rest that lve personally tried to date. Well done (and thnx) guyz! 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying writing in this app and the coaching is great to work from when you are feeling dull. 12/19/19 I am finding that while I still like to write in my various notebooks, when I really want to capture something that I will refer to later I grab my phone and capture it in Journey. Not does the flashback system work great to remind me of things, it is much easier to follow up on stuff because it is easier to find in here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, expressing my feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple. Easy to use. Just what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app 👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i hope you guys last forever!! and i do support u ❤🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A useful tool to record daily happenings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great simple app, like the tags feature so I can go back and review"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A recent update hasn't allowed me to export my entries in Windows or Android with dates in pdf or docx format. After submitting my concerns no fix has appeared. My rating of Journey has begun to plummet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Refund policy is terrible. To clarify, there is an in-app purchase option (which many have said constantly harasses if not used). I expected this would allow me to use the PC and web interfaces as well. After purchase, I found out you still have to buy some subscription to get access to those features. I simply wanted a refund, but their policy is no refunds. Beware."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful, easy to use. Membership carries great benefits."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great that it detects, with satisfactory precision, where you may be when writing. It's ideal to document your mind, ideas, daydreams, during your alone times - on a long flight, or wherever. You can scribble your next blog post and refine it later when it's time to share it with the world. I purchased this app during a long bus ride when I wanted to write something there and then and have never been disappointed since."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write it down once and never forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you🥰💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good. Map include"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app! It's gotten me in the habit of journaling and I've been having a great time with it. I love that you can attach a picture and it logs the temperature and location and mood. I feel like this is such a great way to reflect on the day in a positive way and to have something organized to look back on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Muy bonito aplicativo, me entrega lo que andaba buscando."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for keeping track of daily remodeling work that I've done, along with pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Extremely useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am a premium user and I think you need a Complete UI design transformation like the other dairy apps.the current UI is very old in style and boring.Though I have paid for this app I'm using another app just to experience it's UI ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. They do consistently try to upsale you too premium and it gets old having to close it out 10 times while using it. But it does close out easily enough so only one star is detracted for that. There are not a lot of free options but free is free and that part is functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Markdown and calendar entries are my favorite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Looked nice for while until they try charge you $29 month when it should be free for everyone who enjoy journals i pass"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Interface is friendly. Enjoy the coaching that is available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome. helps me keep track of my thoughts and changing plans without something more complex"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for awhile. It's a great way to write and journal on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app! No issues and it is fun and easy to journal on it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. No hiccups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I'm enjoying this app. No annoying ads and it does just what it's supposed to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not happy at all. The app does look good but did not want to keep it so uninstalled it and they still took money from me. It says I have a membership but did not sigh for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It's easy to use and I like how you can add in photos and videos. The only suggestion I would like to add is the choice to add in a title to the journal. Other than that, would recommend it to everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works for what I need it for. Simple design. Good journal. Update: Live it! With the new features, even better. 😊 12-15-19 Update: Still is the best. 👍💯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, been using for years and I can actually remember things from years ago when I re-read my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a great app. I wish team Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The jury is still out however I'm pretty sure like this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It look like a really great app accept that I real when I realized that you only get 7 days to try it out and then it cost $40 a year I can't afford $40 a year I realized a lot of hard work went into the app itself but that's way too much for most normal people to afford"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great journaling app. The best I've used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app is great! But I have a problem with signing in. I can't sign in on this app even though I have a stable connection. I tried to reinstall the app but that's still the problem. I badly need some assistance 😭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying the simplicity of the app. Hope it is syncs and can be viewed in many devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this diary app because it can attach video also but if picture can surround the article and not all show on the top, it will be good if one day we will need to print out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The new tag input system is highly impractical compared to the old one, which was more responsive and quicker to use. We should at least have the option to switch between them. I reverted to version 2.7.0c which has the old system, and also loads the ""new post"" page faster. Weather info occasionally doesn't load correctly, but that seems version-independent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is really good, but I do continuously get pop ups from the developers about stuff like 50% off premium even though I've already purchased premium. Would it be possible to not get these pop ups? It makes the premium experience feel a little less ""premium"""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic product. It has depth towards improving your journaling. I've been having fun documenting my trip."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Very well made app. Lots of features, easy to use. I'm giving 3 stars simply because of the constant annoying pop ups to upgrade to premium. I understand the devs have to eat too but I don't need or want anything that premium offers. Sometimes the squeaky wheel doesn't get greased it gets replaced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: The best digital diary that I've used so far–and I nearly tried every other digital diary available in the Play Store!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it as a diary and I can attach media to it (like pictures, downloaded songs, internet links etc,) I imagine you could use it in a similar way to put together a book, as I sometimes use it to jot down little verses that come to mind. I would recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, but they should reduce money 300rs for lifetime to make it accesible for evry 1, as we in developing countries can invest only this much on a app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good so far but given confusing messages about the cross platform functionality. The adverts suggest I need to pay yearly when so far I have cross platform functionality by paying the one time fee on Microsoft store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"-1 for constant pop ups. Otherwise love!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy using the not complicated concept presented to me by Journey diary.. I love being able to write thoughts in my head when I want, where I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No problems whatsoever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app, but the constant advertisements urging you to upgrade to premium get old fast. It overall discourages me from using the app simply because I know I'll be bombarded the second I open it. I understand that a lot of hard work by a lot of talented people went into making this app, and I'd like to support them, but purchasing an app just isn't an option for some users. These ads don't make me want to upgrade, in fact they encourage me to uninstall the app altogether."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use interface. Excellent for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great tool for travelling.i have the unpaid version so I have to limit it to the four best photos for the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Easy to quickly add journal entries. My only gripe is they would stop asking me to subscribe because I already purchased the lifetime version! No need to pay monthly for something you already paid for!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Buyers beware: If you purchase Lifetime Premium, you will STILL get asked periodically through popups to purchase a membership. Even if you CLICK CANCEL THE AD COMES BACK in a few days. It doesn't matter if you can click cancel. It's not good customer experience to get asked to pay more when you have already paid. They need to do market research to know this is NOT a good experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling, something I always wanted to do but never found the motivation to complete. Journey has made motivation easy through ease, elegance, and availability. December 2019 and still going strong. Journey is an integral part of my journey. Powerful tool and companion. Thanks much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to join and i love this app!♥♥♥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, been using it for 2 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've used several jounaling apps over the years, and Journey has proved to be the best of the lot. But it has become frustrating. It now synches between iOS and Android, but the task bar on the Android app on my Chromebook works only intermittently and for a few seconds. Linking photos is very hit-or-miss at best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's helped me start journaling which I've been wanting to do forever now! The coaches are great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My best diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easiest diary/journal that I've used. Auto dates and pics and locations help track info from fitness tracking to my holidays."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey has actually helped me return to my love for writing. I'm very pleased with the user-friendly, clean and simple format, and various options to personalize entries. I'd definitely recommend this app to others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I feel this is really an awesome app. I write all things which comes to my mind and this is my goals diary.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Niceee 69 420"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Syncs well. Just trying the android version as i only view with a phone on the go. Purchased ipad version and using it for taking journals. Thanks dev team for this great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. I've tried many different journaling apps. I've bought many different special journaling books and other notebooks for journaling. My journaling effort usually last through a couple entries. Then it fell by the wayside. This app is very functional and easy to use. I like the layout and it's an attractive page. I'm now journaling daily if not several times daily. Wish it was free, but the yearly subscription fee is less than what I've spent on all the other things combined"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"happy to recommend this journaling app for anyone. Can work across my ipad and my chromebook or anytime I have access to a browser. I use this everyday now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the security features, the themes, and the membership alliws for more fun stuff. There's also a lifetime membership, which I will take advantage on my next pay period. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey. It keeps me logging my life and it's great, that it works on multiple platforms as that seems futureproof. One thing that annoys me is the pop-ups regarding buying premium. *EDIT* Upping my initial review from 4 -> 5 stars as the company behind was quick to respond and therefore I feel confident that things will be even better going forward. Great product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely to look back at my trips handy really helps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for doing journal entries. I like that it is not tied down to a specific device. I can make entries on any device. I like being able to add pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It has helped me to build a Journaling habit and I use it daily. I recently had a problem adding images (my issue) and they responded really quickly and helped me to sort it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Disappointed when I had to pay to be able to use this app! So the developer sent me a message (which you can fully read) Journey does offer a Free version which can be accessed without any payments/memberships. Most features can be used for free. Okay so I give a try and it's cool but let me tell you before you go downoading this app and start using it and you'll get in the moment of typpng away your thoughts, well unfortunately you run out of characters so technically not Free. Just saying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app was virtually useless. I thought I was downloading a free version but got charged $29.99 even though I never used it more than once. Companies like this count on you being too busy to notice when seven days are up and refuse to refund money for something you aren't using. Buyer beware. Edit: Apparently you don't understand Google automatically authorizes these things whether I want them to or not. That's why you should refund people's money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't usually pay for apps..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app since 2015 and I love it. I have the free version which is excellent for my private journals...I can upgrade if I want to unlock more functions. My data transferred easily when I got a new phone. Easy to use. Journey inspires me to write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so much. Simple tools with maximum benefits."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Was never a diary keeper till i found this app, love it and great to look back on. Tags make it easy to find events and lost memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A skeptic about using a keyboard to journal, but after only a few days I am finding it tremendously helpful. I enjoy adding thoughts at various times and also reviewing past blogs. The free journaling prompts I signed up for keep me focused and on track through the day too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for journaling !!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Unable to connect to Google account, just get an indefinite spinning circle. Before this was quite good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Worked in app on my phone and was very impressed. Wanted to then be able to use it on my PC so I bought the lifetime offer that kept being offered. Now when I try use on my PC I find out that the lifetime offer only works across one platform (android in my case) and that if I want to be able capture my journal entries via my pc where its obviously much easier to write I have to pay extra. Stick with the free version in my mind as paying for crappy extras is not worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app makes it easy and effortless to journal. With talk to text I literally just talk to my phone most of the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great cross platform app. Use it on my Note 10 and Surface Pro. Love the features and above all cloud sync"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really used to like this app. but, then, lost all entries. Support said I needed to enable the online storage, I did. I just transferred data and apps to a new phone, it shows no journal entries, pictures, all record's of past vacations with the new grand children, gone. I contacted support again, no answer, use at your own peril..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app not only is a journal. It's a reminder of where you've been. It reminds me when I have a previous entry from a year ago. Shows me the mindset I was in and how I've changed it. This app helps you keep an eye on your perspective. If you use it regularly, it can be a great asset to getting your mind on paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great free app, ads are not too obtrusive, overall a very good application for journaling your life, highly recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app overall, but there are some things i'd like to see changed. For one, if you do not save what you're currently working on and the lock screen comes on your entry will disappear. Also, the formatting doesn't stay consistent when moving to new paragraphs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this for a year. It's so easy to journal with tons of features and I've never run into ANY problems!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and good for diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal and writing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I think the app is useful, which led me to pay to upgrade more than a year ago. However, as I didn't use the paid features, I didn't want to renew the subscription. I forgotten that the subscription is auto renewal. When I received the renewal billing, I immediately asked to cancel the renewal and for refund. This happened more than a week ago and I have yet to receive my refund. Not a good experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app, would like more formatting options (text size for example, not just the headline sizes)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, with lots of features. Recommended++ and well worth the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good and simple!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this and I use it all of the time!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app i like it so far!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can't start this app on my Android"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gurpreet billa"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. It helps me to journal via type or speech. I use it to document trips, adding pics or a video, location, etc. I think that the only real area I would like to see improved is the ability to add more than 10 pics or one video. Yes, I do make more than one entry but I would be nicer to have one entry than many. Otherwise, I am satisfied."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Quick and simple journal for work or life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have the free version. I used to write emotional things in my notes on my phone, but I wanted a place that I could lock with a passcode and that wouldn't disappear if I get a new phone. I like that it's online, I can tag entries, note my emotions, & it's relaxed. I don't feel pressured to post everyday, and there's no prompts. But when I need it, it's there. I can enter old entries from other apps and date them from the original date. I really like this app for my electronic journaling needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So nice to put down my words and add pictures too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Boy it's a good app, recently discovered video option, filming myself all over the place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. well built. no glitches or problems."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm the type of person who loves physical journals and has about a million. I always said I wouldn't be able to use an app but omg! I love this thing. It has a password option which I love. And it's so convenient being able to write wherever you are when the inspiration hits. Definitely the best journaling app I have found so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is my first time bullet journalling. I like the app so far. I got the lifetime subscription, I found the price maybe a little bit steep but I will think of it less so if they continue developing and adding new features. I enjoy the integration with Google fit though I wish there was an option to have Google fit data entered automatically. I would also like a feature where I could integrate the app into Outlook calendar to at least have calendar titles automatically entered."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is the perfect app for journaling supported by audios and videos. But the account creating is a little inconvenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this on the PC for some time now and recently got the app. I love this journalling app. Not much else to say really. Highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It just works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A happy journalist."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it even more now with the update. Upgrading it to premium was worth it :) Edit: 3 years later and it is still amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app will automatically register you as a paid account after the trial period. Cancelling is difficult to do. Wished I didn't install this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday. Love it! Reliable and simple. Search function makes it much more useful than a paper diary ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally, a solution for all your journaling needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reminder daily to jot ur thoughts Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best for keeping diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent inter face and the cross sync is a winner for me!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ads are annoying. Always comes up when i open the app. Rest its good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps me stay motivated and focused."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It has kept me on track with my journaling and even has the ability to give you daily questions to ponder, depending on what you want coaching on. Worth buying lifetime!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an app that works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A straightforward, no-frills journal app which I use daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful organiser"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it so far but I wish there was a title to be added for each entry. Update: 4th Dec 2019: I have been using the premium version of the app for a long time. I love it a lot. There is a lot to love here. The excellent features , the looks and being able to sync through all devices are all great perks. This is the best app to use for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, but there's a lot of ads unless you shell out $10 for a lifetime membership which *is* worth it compared to other apps like Evernote, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent alternative to DayOne especially those who are Android/Windows fan. I enjoy the customizations, the coaches and the different platforms I can post a journal entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"im very impressed your apps are always great and beautiful. thank you for making them❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, one of the first apps that I install whenever I upgrade my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I didn't think it was worth it. I ordered a journal like this before. I paid $50. for a journal i couldn't get my money back for before the trial was over.I never used it. When i tried later,I never could gain access to it, nor could I ever contact the company. I do like the Christmas journal prompts. They brought back good memories. Unfortunately, it also brought up some sad ones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Phone froze and know I'm not able to cancel not happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for save my day memories ❤️♥️♥️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Found the app quite easy to navigate and update. Private to which I like. A little on your face, some times too many prompts. However I like the app and will continue to use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for penning down your thoughts and self reflection at the end of the day. Great way to organise your feelings and thoughts, especially if u love organising ( many features.)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing I write story all the time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have to pay to use it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best cross platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy Journey. It's simple and clean. I like the reminders and the flashbacks! I wish there were ways to integrate with more apps to help auto journal some things but maybe in the future!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good companion.Nice job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to track daily activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried lots of journaling apps in the past years and I can confidently say that this is the best! I started using free version but I loved it so much, I decided to get lifetime premium. Overall look and feel ✔️ Complete functionalities ✔️ Calendar view ✔️ Photos / Media view ✔️ Atlas (location mapping) view ✔️ Stats analysis ✔️ Sorting (by mood, tags, location) ✔️ Good search engine (search keywords in entries) ✔️ A minor complaint would be: uploaded photos go out of order (in same entry)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I used this for about 5 years now and have a ton of memories. And I bought the lifetime membership. But, there is no way for my to transfer my data to another account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great tool! Allows for flexibility with image uploads, URLs, ability to sync, daily writing reminder prompts, and integrations.♥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really is a great app. It's one of the best journal's I've ever used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I was really hoping I could at least take a look at the app and it's flow before it tried to sell me everything. The black Friday/cyber Monday event was a deal breaker. ""Buy this now! Can't look at our product or leave this sale page, because of you do no sale for you!"" No thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome, great features, best log out there. Use to record goals and milestones in my acrobatic journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Monthly fee? No way. One time charge would have been accepted but on a monthly fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome app. I highly recommended this as digital diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Helps in the development of a good journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I think you should allow user to create their own template for writing daily diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. I have always wanted to do some journalling but have always been inconsistent with entries as my journal might be away from me at the time I want it. This app has made it so much easier for me to journal as I always have my phone on me. I really like the features of this app too, I tried other journalling apps but this one is for keeps. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how clean and simple it is. My favourite feature is the tag system. I tried other journal apps and this one is the one I use now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has really been a life saver for me. Best place to vent is to yourself for real. No judgment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They are obsessed with asking you for money and then more money. Although they professed that you can use their app for free, you will get harassed with ads to pay for the same app. My suggestion is before downloading this app, read through some of the criticisms as I did. Almost all the negative criticisms concerned users not getting refunds and complaints about wanting more and more money even after users paid. I don't like apps that are created by very greedy people so I uninstalled it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This isnt the typical app. Although there are features that you have to pay for, you still get the full experience. THIS IS AMAZING. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It is not free. Although it claims.3 days in 29.99"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app to store my emotions!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems pretty useful so far as a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Free n Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Clean and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for last 30 days. An absolutely amazing way to note your thoughts. I highly recommend it to anyone who want to journal or maintain a diary online."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the prompts!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journey app, I've tried a few and ended up buying this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far awesome .......!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the first journal app that I've actually used and really enjoy. I've made a pact with myself to journal every day. When I've gone back to review my entries, making decisions based on my notes, became much easier having them to review."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Says what it does and does what it says well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always nice to write down my thoughts and come back to them. They even saved my information so when I got a new phone I didnt loose anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, desktop version needs to be cheaper so that there is a fully integrated offering."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the journey app, currently on lifetime premium account. A pity the premium account does not apply to all device, you will have to purchase it on your phone and PC in order to have the same features. The benefits of member does not differ much from premium account. The only added benefit is access to all different platforms. Hope to see more features for membership before I subscribe to it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good. I've got some minor gripes with the UI and I wish there was a real night mode (for OLED not just darker colors), but mostly, I like it. It does what I need. I bought the lifetime premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app I use it all the time!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I used this app for about 6 years but now it shows too much discount,trial,purchase related ads and useless Notifications. It made me feel much irritated tbh. So I transferred all my notes and not going to use this app. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Applause on to all developers mate. Love your app mate, will keep using it for all notes too.. Know that I try all new as they come available too.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great offline journal app that syncs with the cloud! And upgrading to Lifetime Premium isn't that bad if you can catch a deal. The app itself is very calming and minimal in design. But the one thing I dislike is when I double-tap a word that's near the bottom of the screen, it sometimes auto-scrolls up and I end up highlighting the wrong word. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it's super annoying. Other than that, great app from my Singaporean neighbors!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Google dictate for everything so it's super easy for me to add the journal. I love using this for experiences that I don't want to share out to Facebook but that I do want to remember :-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How many times are you going to ask me to get the paid app? And you guys seriously put basic dark mode among other simple features like audio notes behind a pay wall ? Nah screw that, I might just get the full featured app from sites other than play store and use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVED IT"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. You can use it seamlessly across different platforms, upload photos, include timestamps and locations. Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent, i do my journal entries in daily basis. It is just awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😊💖😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, does exactly what I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best I've tried and 8 have tried several. The fact i can sync it with my laptop is awesome. Can jot in it in the daytime then add on my laptop when I get home is exactly what I needed. Cheers guys..... I'm a happy chappy....Update and nearly 4 months later I have subscribed to Premium and that is not something I normally do. Makes some tough days do-able as I can log in and rant, regularly. Gold star guys, I am not easily pleased but this makes me smile x"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great to write about the past of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"initiative to use front the head start. keep it up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been nice to have a place to record my thoughts. Program works good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Misleading subscription! Step 1: start free trial. Step 2: pop up for discounted lifetime premium. (£8.49) Step 3: yearly membership £28.49 which surely after paying for a lifetime membership would cancel the free trial? So now I'm £36.98 worse off. I'm not sure if they understand the difference between lifetime and yearly... If I paid for a lifetime membership why would I want a yearly membership as well? Contacted customer support. I will amend my review if I hear back from them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The best journal app out there, the sync is by fare the great. My only complain is about monthly fees, I prefer a single pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really helps me keep upto date. Like I was logged out for months but when I logged in, everything I typed from June and opened recently 4 months later was there! I'm very glad to have this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful Journal!! It's cloud save has helped me maintain my writings for years now. Plenty of features like tags, search, mood, and pics/videos up load makes it awesome. I definitely recommend this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Like the throwbacks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for lifetime on 3 different devices (Android, PC, Mac). Still you hound me to subscribe monthly. I wish I'd never forked over my money to you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great easy app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it ♥"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Once I started to use it, there was a pop-up within App with a short-term promotion offer with a 50% off the annual subscription (15.99 EUR instead of standard 31.99 EUR). I subscribed to it. Then, a few days later, I was charged once again for the full amount of 31.99 EUR! Upon contacting their CS and filling out the refund form, it has still not been addressed in over 2 weeks. Have not heard back either.. Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed and feeling taken advantage of! Stay away!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it! best journal app 💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app almost had me commit to use it everyday, but for one fatal flaw. The text editor didn't auto save if you closed the app to return to the text editor later. I lost three bomb ass pieces of original writing that way. I uninstalled Journey after the third. There stars. Otherwise a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. It gets the job done!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, does the job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think Journey has given me a very good experience in reflecting my day. What I like is I can access it everywhere, since I use multiple platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Use for food log and daily journal. Love being able to tag people and events. Recommend this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good like that you can get daily prompts that remind you to write. Enjoy the writing prompts available. Easy to navigate and clean simple format. Annoying how they keep trying to advertise for the membership version even when I have purchased the life time version. I get that you need to have ads to make more money but every other day trying to get me to upgrade is a bit much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So many awesome features. One of the best journal apps I've used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app everyday. Please don't change."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Caveat. I am the world's second worst Journal keeper. I say that in the hope that, somewhere out there, there is someone who is worse than me at keeping a regular journal. That said, with Journey, this is probably the closest that I've ever come in terms of keeping a regular journal. The fact that it works across my Android devices, that I can use it through a browser, and that it has an app available for Linux, makes it the app that I use, and continue to use. Excellent work, Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy it, but it is confusing the difference between annual fee vs one time life membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app more than I thought I would. Really helps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Functionality is pretty good but they've upped the frequency of the 'upgrade' ads. I now get one or more full screen ads for every single action I take. This means the user experience really doesn't flow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I used it for more than a year. I was able to mark important dates and events in my life and somehow, this encouraged me to write more. I installed it again here in my new phone. However, I was not able to sync the data immediately and I forgot the pincode! I'm so sad, I didnt't want to lose my entries. I would be willing to avail premium if that's how can i retrieve everything from my old phone. I know its totally my fault , but is there a way? :((("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic! Need some innovation on colors used in the app though!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is the first time I've ever tried a journal app or diary app and I have to say it is absolutely excellent it has really helped me this week to get things off my mind that were bottled up inside and it's a good therapy for myself and I would highly recommend it for anyone because we all have struggles in life and this is something that can help you with those moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app to keep track of your past"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and feature loaded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For a person who loves writing journal, this is the best deal! Looking forward on having more look & feel customizations appropriate for creative humans.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best way to journal and include a few photos ever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like this product easy to use. Althoufh I wish it had a microphone icon so I can journal while driving."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful journal app for me. Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good go-to place for my thoughts. I have switched phones a few times and the info always reappears. I feel like this is a secure platform for anything I write. I recently upgraded to the premium version. I have really enjoyed the writing prompts and it gets me back into my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've used, and I've tried several. I don't burn through as many Moleskine notebooks and Bullet Journals now. Lots of great features, but my favorites are tagging and especially multi-device/multi-platform syncing. I even export journals from my meditation app into Journey. Also, I'm thankful that the subscription model is offered rather than forced on premium users. Lifetime purchase was a wonderful decision."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Found it so easy to remember to jot things down as its on my phone. I get daily prompts aswell. It's been fab for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the type of journalling app that you won't be tired of using for long."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"EASY TO USE. BEST JOURNALING APP I'VE USED SO FAR."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Little things could make it better but I'll keep using until I find a better one for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a fantastic app. Easy to use and definitely makes it easier to track your thoughts. The tags are a great way to organize things as well for easy reference."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Freaking great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but forgot my passcode! How can I recover this?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use and quick as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i signed up for a free 7 day trial but cannot find a way to cancel the free trial. not happy at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied with this app, easy to keep a daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Scam, stay away. Trial makes you commit your payment details. I tried to cancel during my trial and recieved no reply. Miraculously when the payment automatically went through I emailed again and was told they don't issue refunds. I hate scammers like this and doubt the legitamacy of these reviews too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it, but I am kind of concerned about my privacy. Is it possible for someone like an employee who works in two app studio to see my entry without my permission? I am using it for like 2 years straight and I wrote my whole personal life in this app. It scares me to think that someone might be able to steal my entries. Other than that, this is the best diary app ever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"the free mode has a lot of great options. but it obnoxiously pushes the paid options CONSTANTLY."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Beautiful, simple interface, powerful features. Great tool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have another journal app with guided questions for baby memories, and I just transfer the questions to this app, which is way better. I love being able to attach a video. The best part is the export option, because I am so worried about all the baby info getting lost! Love all the details I can add, too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much. Internet. Apple. Android. It doesn't matter it's always there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect. Needs landscape support so people like me can use a larger keyboard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The free version exists only to advertise the updated version. Very annoyed at getting constant reminders and pop ups about giving the app money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic and safe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Smooth GUI and Very helpful support. Thanks Ellen!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that I can be myself and no one else has to know. My journal is always with me, I like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. Buuut, I don't want to continually have to Rate the app every other 10 entries, especially after purchasing Premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app.. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ads for paying users is bs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i just loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is amazing, perfect way to hold all your memories, thoughts and emotions to read later without worrying about anyone else getting to them ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It like the interface and it's basically the app I'd have designed myself for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Wear OS app isn't very useful, can't add entries only view existing ones and viewing is buggy as it doesn't render the html content of journal entries so they get filled with html tags. Phone app is great though. Update: To be clear, this is not the Chrome app with the HTML bug, it's the Wear OS app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I write in it everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A convenient and useful journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Functional but formatting options leave a bit to be desired. Extremely pushy about upgrading to paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to get back to the memories.. digital diary 💯 loved it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bhut achi App he.....very good and helpful. Thanx"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i struggled a bit with my two email addresses and this app. I've had to remove my one account from my phone for my purchase to reflect. that's a bit sucky as that's my primary email, but the app seems to be worth it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too complicated and the decent features are paid for monthly... Daylio is much simpler and only has a one time fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's pretty neat to always be able to Empire memories of an event that just happened for me to reflect back on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super helpful - allows open end daily task recording that meets my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying my journaling experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great across all platforms (pc, android and apple) the only I cant figure out is how to password protect journey on my pc other than that it has motivated me to keep track of my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really have a nice UI and gret features for a free program! I'm so in love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very informative and inspiring!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My new diary n I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the idea of this app and how simple it is to write, keep a timestamp, and organize tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app..allows you to get it all out and be on your phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. It's cheap and you can have a great time even if you don't spend anything. ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great one. Help me to journal and make notes about life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Has changed my life. The best app on Google play for your mental health. Your thoughts matter. <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! The ability to create videos as entries is an amazing tool. The journal prompts are a nice touch, I'm doing the self-confidence building prompt. It has been fun exploring these ideas everyday, going back watching videos and seeing photos. 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for 4 years now and a proud premium memeber. There is one suggestion please if you can add some soothing deep music that plays in a background while one write entry. It would be so awesome. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for recording moments, notes, ideas. Pages can be taged as one or multiple tags for collections and easy reference. Easy platform with extras if wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use! Keeps me grounded on journaling. I wish there is notification to remind me to write, or share past memories when I'm near a place or something. The app does get a little annoying where it keeps prompting you to enter your passcode (maybe set it to 30 min of inactivity)?Otherwise still love the simple and clear UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Good idea, but forces me to type text, where I prefer to use my pen and write by hand. Why else would I use a tablet for?-."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I had used this app some years back when it had cute fox image templates. Please get it back. Love it otherwise - aesthetically very pleasing :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal. Has some extra costs if you want all options, but the free mode is plenty good for most users. I don't have the money for the premium or lifetime options, but there are a lot of cool add-ons which is great if you use several apps for similar tasks. I used to use the journal dailoo . Basically for the rate your day from with emotes 😢😒🤨🙂🤩. Then journey added the feature and I dropped the other app. Hopefully the trend keeps going and I can get down to 1 or 2 apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the app. It has everything I need. I Wish we could add additional journals for traveling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for 4 years now. It is the best journal app out there! 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i enjoy it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The layout is simple and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I have installed the Journey app on all of my devices, use the cloud interface if I am on a browser - it is wonderfully accessible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for a few years. I love it. I love how I can journal on my phone, laptop, etc and it syncs across all. I love that I can add pictures to my entries and I LOVE the search option to find certain entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome diary app. I use it for my Spanish diary and it works like a charm. Nice feature set and it never crashes or eats my posts like others sometimes do. Good job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an easy-to-use writing tool. It's a good way to track date, time, and location of an entry. You can attach photos and audio recordings to the entry. It allows formatting with bold, italics, etc. I use it to note any thought and observation. I want to write more and this is a good way to get used to writing. The tool lets me focus on writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing Journaling app! I've been using it for few years now. I love that I can type my little journal notes in Markdown. *But I'd love it more if it supported Org mode too!*"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app Motivation al"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a very good journaling app. I've tried ten or fifteen different apps and this is the one i ended up with. I even paid for the premium version because I like it so much. There still isn't any way to automatically important all my old Facebook posts into the app, even with the suggested Zapier, but I don't think any of the other apps do that either."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite place to collect and save ideas and thoughts. If we don't write them down we loose them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful and simple diary/ journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled instantly as it requires access to my Google acc. Google the risks. Not only that it's expensive. Also, all your private info you put on here is STORED BY THEM AS THEIR PROPERTY!!! NO THANKYOU!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice, helps store your trips and travels through photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal! I have tried dicferent ones and when i found this one and liked it i didnt mind to pay for a membership to get the special features it offer. I love it! You can add fotos and videos to your entries, as well as tags, location, mood, outside temperature, dark/night mode, which i love, and you can lock it to keep preeing eyes from getting in your swcrets. It also have other very useful features like monthly coaching, among other amazing features. I think is the perfect diary!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love Journey for daily notes, journal/diary, recipes and much more. Tagging each journal to be able to find past entries is great and editing entries is a breeze and adding your mood is great to. Each entry can include your location based on GPS. I've never had any issues. A++ app. Using Pro version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Forgotten my pass code! Help 😂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I bought the add ons and monthly subscription. I'm not sure if they are the same thing. I like the background wallpaper and the themes. I have android could you consider allowing writing in more than 1 color and different backgrounds. I like to write in script. Actually if you would allow the font I have on my system that would take care of the font issue. Thanks for your time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far! I can put family daily memories down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought the Premium version of Journey three years ago when it was available as a Chrome app. I have been using it ever since on my Win10 laptop. Now I bought a new laptop, installed their current app on the same Win10, and my Premium membership is gone. Support says it is because this is now a desktop app instead of a for chrome version, so I have to buy it again, can get 30% discount, but still have to pay 70% for somethig I have already paid for. Really disappointed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty easy to use. You can set up reminders in it, which is very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It create positive vibes in your day to start with a Journal. Using this app helped me to get back on track. Learning good habits and exploring myself with interesting statistics. User Interface can be improved but good for now. Enjoying the app. Very much thanks to developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Deceitful!! So when you download this app, you only get a 7 day free trial, then it automatically tries to upgrade you to the pro version... NOWHERE in the app description does it mention this is a 7 day free trial app! Installed without knowing that, and IMMEDIATELY UNINSTALLED!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the interface very simple and functional and makes entering stuff a breeze. Something I really don't like though: when you are reading an entry and change apps and come back, it doesn't ask for the password. Haven't tried any of the premium functionalities yet, but boy are the ads for premium and ""50% off expiring as soon as you close this pop up"" deals in your face and annoying! The pricing scheme is unnecessarily confusing. Please just make a grid with what's included or not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For someone who loves to write, Journey is a best friend :) love using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I use it in my spiritual journey. Thank you so much. I downloaded the basic app and after using if for a couple of days I bought the full version. I think it's the best out there. Soi give you 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using this tool 💚"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Easy to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is wonderful! I'm using it to log my journey through jiu jitsu. You can add photos to entries, makes it easier to recall the day. Theres also reminders, I have one set 2 hours after my jiu jitsu class so I have time to shower and review everything that happened during class. Highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A year after my four-star review, I'm still with this app, even purchased the upgrade. So, with the ability to customize and selection of coaches, it's earned that 5th star. Original review: The only thing preventing me from giving this app five stars is that I can't make text bold or italic in the free version. Otherwise, its elegant functionality surpasses that of competitors. ~ Write On"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too many prompts to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found this as a really good alternative to journalling on FB. Some place I can keep my memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Terrible. I started a trial and was not interested in this app. When my trial was up, it automatically charged me for a year and I never even put a card number in. They would not give me a refund. I do not use this app except for a grocery list."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this journal app which I have been using daily for over 3 months now. I like to add one photograph every day to go with my entry and I'm looking forward to looking back at memories from a year ago etc once I have got to that stage. One thing that attracted me to this journal app compared to a lot of the others was the atlas feature which automatically tags where you are in the world when you write your entry which you can then see in map view later"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased lifetime premium, but because I have multiple Google accounts on my android phone, Journey keeps asking me to upgrade again, as if I never purchased it. I emailed support and they told me I have to just unsync all my other accounts, which is not a realistic solution when I have multiple work accounts on my phone. When I asked for an alternative solution, they never responded. I am a loyal app user who even purchased lifetime premium for my laptop too, so this is disappointing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tricked me into downloading then revealed that you have to buy it and pay a membership fee which is completely ridiculous I'm not going to pay for something I could just writing in a journal in real life it's amazing the things people will come up to squeeze every laat cent they can out of ""consumers"""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was limited on the free version on how many photos and videos you could upload but now I've got the paid version it was updated straight away, gave me the access straight away, still a bit annoying to be able to upload 10 photos per entry but I suppose it's to encourage you to journal a couple times a day unless you use a coach. The coaches a bit hard to get on with s it's clear it's an American app, some of the life coaches are a bit too self helpy as well but I'm trying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love Journey. I simply wish there was a way to group my journal entries into categories or folders. That way I can have all my ""thoughts on art"" entries in one place, my ""life thoughts"" entries in another and my ""daily entries"" in a third place, all easily accessible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst customer service from any app support team I have ever dealt with. Have been trying to submit a refund, and have been told to refill a form out three times in a row. Each time I haven't got any response back and when enquired, they told me to just do it again and hope for the best. Worst support team ever for a bad app. Don't download. Edit - 11/11/19 - Sent an email and got nothing back. I am very annoyed with the way this situation has been handled. Will be taking this further."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience! I changed phones and it still has all my data! I would recommend it for anyone who wants a permanent solution for a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Love the app but for some reason entries keep dissappearing. That's the only reason I haven't paid for premium. Very frustrating!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. I enjoy using it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this app only to find that the screen will NOT rotate to ""Landscape"" to expand the keyboard for easy typing. Very difficult to type an entry on the tiny keyboard. They really need to fix that. I emailed them for a refund and they have yet to respond. Edit: They just REFUSED to refund me because I gave a 1 star review. Is that even legal?? Jeromy said ""We do not tolerate this behaviour!"" WTH? Well according to these reviews you've never refuned anyone. Sorry but these ppl are a scam!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool app works for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Dont get me wrong it was great until i accidentally deleted it... i tried to log back in but all it showed was the wifi symbol crossed out. Then i tried to sign up new with a new account and it showed the same thing. Its now with all my accounts on my phone so i cant even use the app! Help >:("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very quick and easy to jot my thoughts at the moment into the app. Works smoothly across my android apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like it but... There are a few things I dont like. I like the adding attachment option but it seems like you can only add one. I like recording my thoughts so only having the ability to add one attachment is a deterrent. When recording it seems I can only 10mins. Which sucks unless you can have multiple attachments THE ONE BIG CONCERN I HAVE IS WHEN I WENT TO THE WEB OPTIONS AND THEN CLOSE THE APP AND THEN OPENED IT THE WEB OPTION WAS UP. IT NEVER ASKED FOR A PASSWORD OR WENT BACK TO THE APP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Very easy to use and you can have it on the web, your phone and as a desktop app. It helps me process my thoughts and clarify my own life purpose and goals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"landscape mode not available when screen rotation on"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app , love the throwback feature. Wish you could save videos and photos together but it's great to have a photo/feature at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsm😍❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a simple and easy to use journal app with a clean ui. One can make daily entries in it quite easily and it automatically captures date of entry, location and weather at the time of making the entry. It can also be used to capture longer entries about things that matters. All in all it is one of the best diary apps i have used. Prompts to upgrade can be a little intimidating and shouldn't be so frequent. I might actually upgrade if it prompts me less frequently with an honest offer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"To buggy when trying to select text! Cannot move cursor without the page jumping all over the place! And I wasted $10 on this terrible app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journaling app there is. Period. I've been using this for several years now and it just keeps getting better! I love the ability to sync between devices. I love the new formatting options (can we get horizontal line for mobile too??) I love the user interface. It's well designed. Intuitive. Clean. A journaling app for adults. Keep up the outstanding work developers. I have a paid subscription and it's worth every cent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app for writing down my thoughts and copying things for my record."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using Journey. You can password protect your entries, you can input pictures, you can set reminders, if you're someone who wants, or needs, to write more often but you keep forgetting. I have been very pleased with my experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Daily awesome joy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"LOVE the app. Would give 5 stars if I weren't bombarded with nagging upgrade screens every time I open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use - nice Themes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice way to catch my private thoughts, dreams and resolutions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an awsome journal its fun doind this in the morning getting routine back in my life is challenging . But awsome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great is you use it.... Still up to you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love how I can really make this my own!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sends push notifications for sales..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. I like the reminders and throwback notifications"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very convenient for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I haven't even begun to use every feature available in this journaling system. There are so many wonderful tools."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far, helping me to get the Journaling habit 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best digital diary there is...!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I complained about the desktop app earlier with html and was advised on where to download a link which will not repeat that again. This is an edited review after giving two points previously. Thanks to the admin"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app for jotting down things at the end of the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Too much useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for diary notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, makes it easy to input quick entries or longer ones with as much detail as you would ever want. Locations, pictures, emotion tags whatever I want, it's been great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Best of this kind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is better than I could have expected. It is visually appealing and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would give it 5 if I was not interrupted so much with promotions and stuff even after I purchased the lifetime premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I enjoyed this diary and after some time away doing something different than journaling when my dad died, I tried to go back and get my information. I had to deal with their awful customer service and it took days. Come to find out, at some point they moved to a google login only. So all of my journal entries from the past, before they forced google, are now gone. It is so dissapointing and they were zero help in recovering years worth of journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is all good for me, that is it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app but a bit disappointed that after I signed up for an annual subscription for £12 (got 50% 'special offer)', I then discovered that Lifetime Access is only £8.49! Would love to know how I can change this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Make sure to sync your journal incase you forget password"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks so much. So easy to use but really effective. Quick note or more detailed reflection, whatever your mood, however little time you have. Great. Update Oct19 continues to be carefully improved and refined. Still exceptionally good in how neatly and effectively it works including photos, notes, attachments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Something is too much! Let me experience more 1st. Sometime less is more^^"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have stopped journaling for a long while and only recently gotten back after moving to new phone set and get prompted. Still nice clean app to use and let's see if I can keep journaling longer this time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient, accessible, organized"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amzing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Favorite journal app. Great for times on the road."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Eay to use, makes me want to open it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just started trying this app. I love how it saves in case I forget to. This is a real blessing since I forget sometimes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks for working my feedback add color in text one more thing please add text size in tool.thank you.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it! easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very nice designed app. Easy to use, but also stylish."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bought the paid version.. love the interface and most of the features...enjoying using the app !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app I enjoy it very much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome, better than DayOne"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I lost my whole past journals. I love to collect the past memories ❤️ but i lost my whole data. You lost the trust."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy writing in this app. Better than posting about my life in social media. I can keep track of my life in this manner."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app to use regularly. This helps me to share thoughts and pictures to remember my memories everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it for one year. It's the best journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for a few years now and for a good portion of my relationship. It's nice to look back and see all the entries. Some were written with tears in my eyes other my smile unbreakable. I really enjoy this app I plan to keep using for a good while some day I might even go for the premium option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is useful but the premium adds disturb me a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful application!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Epic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Every time I take a photo the app is like 'OMG DO YOU WANT TO PUT THAT IN THE DIARY AND WRITE ABOUT IT' ... No it's a bus time table for god sake... Other than that the app has served its purpose I am using for keeping a journal as I go vegan and it's a pretty straightforward easy to use app does what it says ont tin cracking!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't even test out app without attacks to pay. As soon as you open the app you receive a bombardment of demands that you subscribe. I counted FIVE separate attempts to take my money, all of which threaten you when you dismiss them, before I could even see what the app does! Greedy money grubbing harassment won't win you any fans."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app for journaling or maintaining a diary. Feature rich and bug free. So smooth and secure to use. Best part is that it's backed up on cloud so i can access my entries anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, lots of functions if you want it, but not bloated. Please stop with the ads. I already have Premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is there a way to import my diary from Excel?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Instantly uninstalled when I get a pop up with every button click to subscribe. I can buy a plain old journal for 2 bucks every year, why pay every month? Also when of the other reviews was about how bad they harass with ads to subscribe and they told the guy to subscribe. How pathetic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This APP pretty good to let you record your own story or moment !! so I am really suggest this APP!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient access wherever you take your phone!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Una maravilla, me encanta cómo te da mucha libertad a la hora de escribir y también te da un pequeño sistema de etiquetas con el que ordenar todo lo que uno escribe. Puedes anexar varias fotos a una entrada, puedes ver tu humor del último mes basado en las entradas que escribiste, y puedes escribir tanto en PC como en teléfono. Una maravilla."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I have one in all my phones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love that I can use this across multiple platforms and that it organizes it all in one place. I have always journaled and this makes it very convenient for me to share my thoughts and to continue that process in a digital format. Love that I can add pictures and even sound bites to capture this journey of life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app! Now if I can only remember how to change my profile photo."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have some habbit of writting poetry but at the time when a rhyme strikes in my mind i dont have pen and paper ,i satarted searching for app and as journey put that search to end ......I M LOVING IT"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Extremely persistent ads to get you to upgrade. There's also apparently a ""limited time"" sale going on, all the time. 🙄"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a user-friendly app for keeping your daily journal. It has search option that I really like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best apps for everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app in my opinion. I love the clean design and features and the throwbacks make me feel more connected with my life. The search function is great too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"अप्रतीम"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Downloaded, went through the registration rigmarole to find this is only free for 7 days then you have to pay per month with no mention in product description. No thanks. Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I use this app daily. The developers did a good job. But please add more features for free users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Okay...Loving this app a lot...I'm using this it's been almost 2years....but as I don't have any credit or debit card,I'm unable to get the premium pack but I kinda need that☹️☹️☹️😣 Why there's not any other way to get premium pack!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how easy the app is to use and that I can add pictures! I also like that I can back it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Free is only a trial version. Trial is only for 7 days. But they don't tell you that til you've already installed the app and did the whole login process. Uninstalling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I rarely rate apps but this is exceptional. Using for at least 1 yr and every time I look through old entries I get that feeling of my memories being conserved And no ads what do you expect more these days Beautiful environment for writing 🤠"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. Helped me find my inner voice again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, even I love it more than dayone , great addd the coaching tool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant, updates include all variety of needs. (Update) Have been using the app for around 4 years now and must say this is the only app I never want to uninstall, ever. The sync is perfect, the new features that get added are very helpful and it's just simple and very aesthetically pleasing. Hands down the best app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Top"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was subscribed automatically for membership without my consent. After trying to contact them to find out how to get a refund. There was no response. TERRIBLE! Now I have paid for it and dont even get to enjoy the privileges for membership account after unsubscribing it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Seems to be what I'd hoped. The ads for upgrading are unrelenting so unless you want to spend$$ to pay for a version, get use to it. I'll keep looking for something else."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far the best journal app I've used. Everything is very convenient and easy to use :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It's so convenient and easy to use. I've always wanted to keep up with a diary, but hate handwriting things. This has helped me so much this past year. They offer a premium option with extra stuff, which costs. I haven't purchased it, but would like to in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Be wary of the trials. Great app to help me journal. But I ended up paying a lot of money for something I didn't want and don't like because I couldn't figure out how to cancel to trial. I tried the relationship one. It's not even helpful questions. The main part of the app is wonderful though!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have installed the app, bought the Lifetime Premium, and it works in the app. But when i opened my account in web I'm back to the free version. Please fix this first. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hope theres a tick box. 😍😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, great for recording all of my thoughts and daily happenings.👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I put in things like dogs shots and yard spraying to mention a couple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Upon providing my Google Account permissions, I was offered a trial premium account, which I declined. I was welcomed and then there was a ""fire sale"" notification, complete with 60 second countdown timer, to get me to purchase a one year subscription. I only just installed the app, how is anyone supposed to know if it is right for them at this point? I immediately closed the app and uninstalled it because of these kind of tactics are wrong."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Unable to install this. I did shoot an email to the support team and they did read it but I never got a response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Two words. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It keeps my story from being lost from access consciousness"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Works across different platform which is clearly a great feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and user friendly. I just love it! Gives me the motivation to write down my goals and seeing the progress"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"If only we have to pay one for life, it will be good app ever. I just don't accustomed to pay every month year. Sorry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so great and will be great for my life to create memories and seeing myself getting better on a daily basis. Can't wait to get throwback from this. Purchased the lifetime premium which I think is absolutely worth the price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Very user friendly and I liked it so much I upgraded!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'll keep you updated as I learn. 👍🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love how this app has helped me keep track of how God has been speaking to me in my life. I like fact that I can take or up load pictures that remind me of his presence during a hard time or just look over blessing in the past days. But most of all I enjoy the ability to sync with my PC or phone. That my journal is always with me. Just like God is. Thanks for making such a great app and for allowing God to bless me and others in such a great way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Clunky. Crashes a lot. Expensive for what it is. Support is poor. Don't waste time investing in this. I'm copying my few entries into my calender then deleting it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to use. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience so far, I imported a ton of journal entries from another app. Definitely recommend this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tried to get me to pay 15 dollars for a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app. -my pleasure. I just upgraded to pro. :) I hope you also have dictionary or even just synonym just so we can pin-point what we truly feel. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the interface and sync between Mac desktop and Android handset."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gud"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a very helpful app and let u type as much as u want"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Text formatting features are missing like Bold, Italic, Underlined & strike through... Please add them ASAP.... Without those the long texts look dull and uninteresting to read. EDIT: Thanks for adding these features. It is by far the best journaling app I've came across."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Be careful about annual subscription. I wanted to cancel my subscription and you cannot do it via the app OR the website. No problem, I'll contact customer support. ""You have to do it via the online store where you purchased the app"" This is ridiculous! I should have control over where/when I cancel the app. Now I have to cancel my Visa card just to get rid of one payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly and well organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful app, not there to enforce anything in your life but rather a tool to support you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I think this is a great app. I just have to start utilizing it more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"At the time I tried the app I had no idea a fee was involved. Especially if it did not show up on my phone for the first month. Didn't matter to Google. I'm not Chinese. Also GOOGLE I DO NOT WANT RENEWAL. I UNINSTALLED. I consider it fraudulent. I just want to make sure it is cancelled. I think it may be easier to get an individual written letter from each Senator than to be sure you have an app canceled. It is one MAJOR REASON I don't buy hardly any. Play Store doesn't give an option in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The journal prompts are great. I just wish I could do two of the prompt journeys at once, ie gratitude AND fall."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beginer user, but loving the app so far. ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app ever. It'll make my psychiatrist proud."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good. I use it less than my actual journal, like way less, but when I do use it it's good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app to record my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty good app for journaling. Good interface on mobile, web could be a bit better. -1 star because even after I paid for lifetime I still get popups trying to upsell the subscription. Please give the option to disable those after lifetime payment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and a good layout"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. I use it everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it, it has all what I want for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A lovely journal, the free version is marvelous, and the one time pay one is a good price, and high quality"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this daily to record what's happened that day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, allows us to add video and pictures to our journal and identify trends by using tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful easy to uae."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just an easy to use and so useful app... All my trips are recorded with pictures and notes. If you have internet it automatically adds temp, and location so you don't have to worry about it. Also you can edit on the phone or online on a website so easy to add on the go and edit at home. ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My faith in the Journey app has been restored. I posted a concern and Jeromy from customer care responded and fixed the issue within 24 hours. That swift reply illustrates true professionalism and strong customer service! Thank you Jeromy. E. L."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I like that it's password locked and the journal prompts are fun. No ads too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Disclosure, I pay for the premium version, but it's gorgeous. $3 a month, I use this app more than daily, it's just awesome. Very streamlined, very beautiful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Open the app for the first time, there is a *one time offer* to buy premium plan at lesser price on first screen. At least let me try out the app before considering the premium version. Disappointing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app.. handy to use.... You can write Anytime..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"More than just useful. It can be your daily log, a reminder, your quick note etc. Loved using it. Impressed with its features. A great app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Won't download. Want to get a yoohoo mail account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. I am one of the early users so got lifetime paid at a great price but now the price is ridiculous. Further I really wish for a feature to have some more data on the entries. And to be able to scroll past in the months. Currently you can't scroll back to more than 6 months."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Easy to use. Syncs across devices with no issues. Has become a regular part of my routine for 2+ years. Downgraded the Stars. Can no longer figure out how to export more than one entry at a time. You used to be able to select a date range..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing for tracking my day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decent diary app. Some aspects are a bit cumbersome, but overall it is very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal. Lots of ads to upgrade but that's okay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Simple n elegant"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's healthy 😁 to vent 😂 safely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use with great features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: It's getting better now. But I have one issue though, I exported all my entries (which was a total of 161) because I had to reset my phone. And when I got back the app and imported back the entries, several of the entries are gone missing. I saw that it was only 151 left, and I know there are no other ways to get them back. I would like to know if I did something wrong? So I won't make the same mistakes again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Could be more useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still haven't found a perfect journal app but this is the closest I have found. Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"attachments. for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice for writing your daily activities, expressing your thoughts and feelings that you can't share with anyone else's."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome good way to keep track of things"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Очень классное приложение."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, just not interested in new age techniques"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I made the switch from Day One and I haven't regretted moving all my entries. I love the flexibility of Journey - I can use the website, desktop app and offcourse the Android app. Great use of Material Design and Rock solid in terms of stability."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app by far. I can journal, store photos (memories) and more. I love it. I am able to upload my photos right to the app, delete them from my phone amd have them forever. When you have over 10k photos on your phone its helpfull forsure. So glad i found this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a best one I love this app My photo my videos and all my stuffs are safe it's an amaizing app download it you never regret"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have always found this app helpful 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i like so much this app. It gives me all things i need from a journaling app such as the ability to access using any devices, photos attachment, and etc. It is also easy to used. I plan to upgrade to premium one day to unlock all features they offer but if you just need to write a journal that can be accessed online anywhere in the world, the free version is more than enough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So far, so good(when I can take the tyme to noodle with this APP -- JOURNEY and its JOURNEY.CLOUD version -- to figure it out/learn how to most simply and effectively use it/them). For the most part, it seems to be exactly as it's described; I'm seriously considering the PAID VERSION(I just need to get to know the FREE VERSION better before I decide to make the LEAP to PAID). The HELP available in the FREE/TRIAL version is limited(thusly prolonging my ""trial"" of it). Rating it 3-☆s for now. ~♤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still a great app to use. Syncs perfectly with all other platforms and doesn't have any issues. Looks good too. I wouldn't mind a few more features like recording emotions and rating the day for example. Editing this review a couple of years later and nothing has been added. Please update this app so it's competitive against the other apps available!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Me ha encantado desde la primera vez, me ha ayudado mucho, una bonita interfaz, con diferentes opciones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is great - no lie there. What isn't cool is how they present the difference between ""premium"" and ""membership"" options for purchase. I have zero problems paying for something I like, simply be clear as to the differences between what I am purchasing vs not. Outside of that - it's pretty cool. The ""tracking emotion"" functionality is a little wonky and needs tweaking (and yes, I'll email the devteam the feedback) - excellent overall."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, does it all👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Spam"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Useless support and removed any support for all text expanders with mark down. Contacted support again and confirmed that text expanders are no longer supported. Do not purchase at this point, there are better apps out there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best application. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Always crashing on my chromebook. Not sure if it's the new updates but it hasn't worked in a few months"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm a subscriber and I'm loving the new update with colored text and highlighting. Something that could be improved is having tags in a group where we can choose multiple tags at once instead of 1 by 1, this gets tedious. I like the dark theme but a black amoled theme would be even more awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoyed this app to the point I upgraded to the highest membership there is. It's easy to use, I like the format, and it's a great way to keep track of my daily life. We get so busy these days that we tend to forget the things that impacted our days, but this app makes it possible to reflect back on all of that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and convinient application that let you log anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun and helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, been using it for three years now"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I like this app for the most part except for two very annoying flaws. There is no support for landscape mode in the app and when I save an entry on the Android app, the formatting is all weird when I view it on the windows desktop app. Please fix these issues and Journey would easily deserve 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app, find it useful. Does frequently try to get you to upgrade, but it is free after all so it's hardly a fair complaint."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A must download."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really good to record everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I never realized before the benefits of keeping a journal and I miss it if I don't keep it up. I've tried several others and Journey is absolutely the best and always my "" go to journal"" now. It's reliable, has everything I need and I never worry about losing any entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"7 days trial then paid, not warning in advance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, just discovered, free to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to write without a voice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has helped me do so many things I thought I couldn't do. I use it for goals and stuff. I only use the basic settings but that is all I really need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, one of the best for keeping track of writing. There are many tool they have included that make it very user friendly.!! Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app to document new car maintenance!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek and useful to register you day-to-day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of my favorite apps! It's the perfect journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app I use it to detail main things i do on a day to day basis. Great to add appointments pics location etc & easy to use. Very useful if you want to recall previous appointment dates or any related info you have logged. Its hard to remember things i done last week/month etc but using this app is a great memory tool. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mare than what I need. Good thoughts implemented"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has to be the best out of similar apps not intrusive at all I give it a 10*"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its quick and easy and always with you because it's on your phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not beautiful. The visited city will be replaced by a huge useless square instead of a simple cross"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The jounaling app I love, fluid interface, easy to use, clean UI. Has throwbacks moments, and track my jurney."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been extremely helpful for me in taking notes and keeping my thoughts organized."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to write about your life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to vent emotions into a tangible medium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good journal app,u can use this to keep track of daily activities, the minus is everytime u open it,the app prompt u to pay,u can choose not to pay for subscription but its just annoying app keeps prompting u to pay once in a while. Suggestion: remove the prompt screen to pay for subscription,if user like the app enough,they can manually go to setting and choose to upgrade and pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I downloaded 5 different journalling apps and I settled on this one because of it's ease of use and functionality. I particularly like the coaching section (although I think this could use more content) and the journalling prompt, which has encouraged me to write something every day. I liked this app so much that I committed to the membership and even though I think the price is a bit high, it has been a good investment so far. It's so easy to use that I find I'm writing all kind of nonsense in there which is great for a person like me who has too many thoughts in their head. I like the tagging system, although this could be made easier if you could bulk tag your entries from the main page if you a)forgot to tag your entry, b)created a new tagging system. The only minor annoyance is that there is a max 90 second timeout and after each entry you need to re-enter a passcode which seems unnecessary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"""Tags"" are a great feature. Good for tracking thoughts, ideas, to do's, etc. Professional and easy to navigate. The atlas is a kick ass feature. Uploading photos is fun. The throwback entries that pop up on my notifications is the best! I highly recommend this app. I have paid version, well worth it. Thumbs up!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the Great app I ever used. Just wants an option to categories the events or notes. Although there are tags but sometimes needs folders to categories the events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I find myself being a lot more present in how i feel because Im quickly and easily making notes all day and taking snapshots of little things. Highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Feels like writing a real diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loves it Im loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Absolutely no reason NOT to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy and fun to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing, premium us cheap AF. It's like perfect if u don't like a diary but want to record ur experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"A GREAT Journaling app... but, but has a lousy search. I have been journaling since 1993 and have thousands of entries... I was able to transfer them from Palm to Android. I am using JOURNEY on Android now. It is a good app, but the search functionality is terrible... Please, please, update with boolean search, nested searches, saved searches. The SQLite database that is included with every version of Android supports full-text indexing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used this app with no problems for a year and would've given 4-5 stars. After the last update I could no longer sign in with my passcode. Loading the app only gives me the option to make an entirely new account through Google. I no longer have access to my own work (an entire year of writing is GONE without a trace). Do not trust this app with anything even mildly important. Learned that the hard way!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app very user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Joumy:Diary,Motivationl_"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use thoughts and moments catcher."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for nosy cousins lol"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful apps to keep track of our life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I hope it can be customized for a better look."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is really a good App, where you can add not only your journey, but also include your photos and videos that are important to you. The suggested phrases help a lot, because some days we need inspiration to start writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app , never give it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Truly a phenomenal journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am constantly being asked to upgrade to the premium, which I do not need. All this pop up are annoying and create a bad user experience for me. Recognize that you have people that won't upgrade and let them use the app in peace!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice, user friendly and simplistic journal app. I also like the colors, for some reason it makes me feel calm."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!! Perfect on the go app to journal or keep notes close at hand. I've used it for more than a year now and still use it each day. Thanks!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the fact it keeps track of were I'm at when I'm journaling, that's one of the main reasons I keep this app. I'm still exploring this app as I developed the habit of daily journaling, so I will have more to say on it later, but so far I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely great! Recent updates added great features making it the absolut best journal app, I believe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"*BEWARE* I got charged the annual fee even though i purchased the lifetime membership before the trial ended. This is very dodgy practice. Update: after spending months trying to get my money back, they have to still not reimbursed me. I'm deleting the app. Don't download, they will deceive you. Update2: your 'misunderstands' is not putting money back into my account. Fix your underhanded processes!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app looks good but ......The app tried to force me to pay the subscription. It wouldnt even open the free trial. Lame. Uninstalled!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice wish more stuff was free though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like it. i can keep track of my state of mind and my ideas...progress"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to document what goes on during your day. You can look back and see what you have done... or didn't do that you thought you did and/or wanted to do! Great for daily accountability in addition to my ""to do"" app. I seem to put more detail into this journal as opposed to having things in ""bullet"" format in my ""to do"" app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I like that I can back it up to a file."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I am really enjoying this app and the application it has in my life. This app is allowing me to accomplish my goal of using my smart phone to be more productive and less of a distraction on social media. This app allows me to appreciate my own life more"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for several years now and it is so worth it. I especially enjoy the daily throwbacks, the serach feature, the abilty to attach audio and pics.I have it on my phone ,tab,comp and the ease of journaling is awesome. It is truly worthwhile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hey, There is no problem in the app but I am having trouble to see the mood emotions as this is soo tiny. Can you please make it little big so that I can see everydays moods easily in home page?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Keeps me coming back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is a lifesaver. I write in it every single day and sometimes 5 or 6 times a day. Of course its my dailey diary but also my shopping lists or notes to remember and my rough drafts to make edits. I can use it to go back and remember dates. There are no frills that distract me from my goal... By far the most useful app I've ever downloaded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's become totally spammy and infurating. Need my money back only these companies make it as difficult as humanely possible to even make that happen and use all sorts of psychological bs to make you regret your choice to ever do something as stupid as buying an app in the first place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Encouraging and enjoyable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you are looking for a digital journal, this is a great choice. It's well organized and easy to use. It also allows for additional details to be added to journal entries, including photos, location, and weather. My favorite feature is that it syncs across all of my devices, making it readily accessible wherever I am. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"In our everyday life, there is more than 1 activities. So we also wants to add them in journey. So we need auto-completion for the activities so that we can quickly add them. Here is an example :- WHERE 🏡 MyHome 🏨Hotel 🏖️ ShortTour 🌍 Travel 🏕️OtherPlace WORK 📊MyBusiness 🏢 Office 🕺OffDay/Leave TODAY 🏃Busy 💆‍♂️Relaxing 🥁Event 👥WithFriends 🏥Sick/Hospital ENTERTAINMENT 🎵Music 🎬Movies 📱MobileGaming ▶️Youtube 📺TV ACTIVITIES 🚶MorningWalk 🏋️Gym 🛍️Shopping 🏙️Hangout 🎁Gift"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app's design is really clear and pleasant, and writing entries is simple and easy. I like the metadata options - adding mood, automatic location, tags. It's really nice to view past entries on a map - gives a really nice nostalgic feel. Two issues. First, no RTL text support in editor and viewer (EDIT 10/15/19: fixed, thank you!). Second, when detecting new photos on the device and suggesting to write a new entry, there's no way to exclude folders from monitoring."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I liked the app so far. I even bought the premium upgrade. Then I bought a new phone... I wanted my entries from my old phone transferred to my new phone. But it's not possible because the app doesn't connect to my Google account. Obviously it did connect to my Google account without a problem to receive my purchase. This is really annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It does what I need it to as a place to put my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Grateful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice. Easy to use. Works great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful for archiving journal entries be they typed or scribbled IRL. I plan on getting the premium version eventually for the export feature. Membership seems far less worth it for the subscription price"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Straightforward and intuitive to use. I've tried a lot of different journal/diary apps - this is the only one that I've kept coming back to to write in. Worth the investment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Did Marie Nuchols get her refund? I have Journey on three devices but they aren't being kept in sync. Update: Journey support was quick to respond though I was slow to get back to the problem. One of my tablets was not logged into Google Drive. Logging in solved the sync problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Functional and does the job. I haven't been using it regularly to rate it 5."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very easy to use and I love the fact that I can add many pictures. I got the first year at half price, but I'm not sure I can afford the yearly subscription at $25. I have been trying to keep a diary since I was 11 years old and maybe this app will help me succeed! I love that I can attach many different kinds of attachments or even take a picture on the Fly. It's nice that I can set locations that I frequent. I also love the color scheme but would like to see choices on that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"way too pushy on upgrades"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great features and good UI. Bought the lifetime premium for dark mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, but I get tired of the push for purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Lovely and useful app. I would've given it five stars but unfortunately, I cannot seem to restore my Lifetime Premium purchase when I switched to a new phone, and it's creating quite a lot of inconveniences. I've already sent an email to no avail. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a joy to use, very light interface and quick to add a daily entry with no issues. Definitely worth every penny."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Right to left support came back, but now the app stopped asking for passcode at all. Also, I can't access my account on the website, for heaven alone knows what reason."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journaling App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The using experience is very good. Will use this app more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too much upgrade request pops up...its quite irritating"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update. Thank you!!!; It worked 😊😊🤸🤸 This app really helps me out my feelings in perspective whenever and wherever I am."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please give us night mode in normal version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for more than a year, nothing to complain, all works very well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great and perfect app, totally worth buying. You can write about anything here, from your life goals or spontaneous thoughts and sort them by labels. Lots of features too for you to explore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect as a diary and for writing therapy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only ""Free"" for a few days."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. Using it as a journal of my 60th year, with pics of all my antics and bucket list adventures now I'm retired. It serves as a memory jogger and eventually a book solely for my family to laugh at in the future. I've purchased the upgraded version as I wanted to attach more pics and audio along with the sync and download options. Well worth it in my view and I like to support useful and clever app developments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have no words, Its just right and good for me I use it everyday to jott down!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Please make the mood emoji more big. Its too much small"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Staying true to my Stoic goals and virtues. Feels good to meditate and reflect regularly. Quality app for the purpose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really nice! I love the convenience of having a journal on my phone and it's features are simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"5 stars so far. Using for daily journal but also entering 40 years worth of letters because I can't keep lugging around and can't bear to toss out. Will give a final rating when I've finished and print to pdf as a backup. Love the search function. Paid for the app; definitely worth the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for about four years now and I absolutely love it! I have had several issues with bugs and such in the past but the developers were always fast with their support. I have been using the paid version and the only thing I miss now is the ability to add photos and videos in one post and the ability to sort the photos when adding them to a post."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it...!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I'm an avid journal writer and can use this anytime of the day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for a few years now. I've tried at least 10 other journaling apps. I like the location tag on thus one, and it's simplicity is nice. Evernote used to be my favorite until they put an upload limit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use journal, with a reminder so I am sure to write in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent app for keeping a journal. Good experience with support. It has a few things that can be improved, for example: I could only enable the Coach feature by changing the Android system language to English"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Beware. Lifetime Member but I had to delete this app because of serious privacy issues. This app is exposing user information to Facebook by including tracking code for Facebook Analytics and Facebook Places. This means app usage and user location is being exposed to a company known to exploit this type of sensitive data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So nice to have this journal at my fingertips whenever the mood strikes! Love that you can use larger font sizes and give a status update on mood as well. Way to go!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Constantly harrasses you to upgrade to the premium version. You cannot open the app or write an entry without an upgrade popup. There is a gray bar across the bottom that gives you access to upgrade, this should suffice. Harrassment doesn't work. If this isn't changed soon, I'll be uninstalling the app. I'm not interested in seeing 5 or 6 ads everytime I write an entry! The basic does what i need it to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very pleased with this app. Makes journeling so convenients & always within my reach!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me get and start in the habit of ed pursuing myself with the written word."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app that's easy to use. I pay for monthly full use and it is so worth it! So far I haven't found anything I dislike. I love that anytime, anywhere I can just write my thoughts, day to day stuff etc. I think the daily inspirational quotes are great and I like that you can write your thoughts about it. Probably the only thing (and I don't think it's specifically to do with app) is the location - my map looks like I live at 5 different houses on my street!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Updated Updated opinion: overall the app is good and does what it says, the ui is clean and easy to use with ability to add pictures and selecting location. and the developer answers to messages so thats nice too. AND they fixed RTL issues so now i can say the app is almost perfect. Very good job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks its working now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a while love it. It has all the features I needed for easy daily journaling. love the interface as well very clean and neat ✨💎"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Kindly fix the right to left writing direction. It use do work just fine in the older versions of the App but it stopped working in recent updates and it's really frustrating. Please fix Edit: it works perfectly now thanks for addressing the issue. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Trustworthy and worth the purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful app. Instant buy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Web version times out, not saving entries. The app is a colorful notepad, useless without the sync with the web version. There are free apps that do a better job as a standalone journal. Support is frightening and I don't mean it as a Halloween pun. No refund option. Edit in response to Two App Studio reply: Please, please learn what time out means and yes, you did receive an email from me. Your support was unclear what ""time out"" means. I had to provide a Webster description and although I did send a second email along with the review on Google Play, the email returned back with ""we are not available right now"" but I can see you are rather available for negative reviews. Edit #2: Support suggested disabling firewall and anti-virus to use the web version properly without timeouts.. (other journaling apps available for Android/PC function just fine with firewall/anti-virus on). No, thank you! Huge red flag right there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not liking the ad pop ups, but they are few & far between. Otherwise, great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I decided on this app because I was limiting my social media time and wanted something I could still write things in that my kids say and just a daily thing to keep track of my life. I wanted one where I could add photos too. Honestly, that was my favorite part of Facebook...being able to document things. So, this app has been fantastic at letting me just write things down whenever they pop in my head and it allows me to do it where it's just for me and I don't have to get on social media."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is app is seamless, beautiful and does EXACTLY what it says it is gonna do. Do you need more?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've really enjoyed my use of this app, I payed for the Pro and think the additional features are definitely worth the money. I've been writing in Journey for almost 5 years, and don't foresee a time when I wouldn't continue narrating my journal of life, using this as the mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"U can log in with google account. Fancy interface, diary placed chronically with different tags if u want. Very easy to use. Best diary app ever!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app and has got ne keeping a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely solid app. Extremely useful for organizing your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It's great for daily tracking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This it's the best note-taking app I've come across. I usually don't do subscriptions, but this app has been worth every penny."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Downloaded this app to try out and as soon as I opened it it was trying to get me to pay for a subscription. I get that it has in-app purchases but I don't agree with paid subscriptions being pushed on users before they've even had a chance to try it out. I also don't agree with ongoing subscriptions for what is essentially a digital diary. EDIT: EVEN IN THE RESPONSE TO THIS THEY'RE PUSHING ME TO PAY THEM. I get that a lot of work went into it but I'm not going to pay monthly for a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this app! Journey has been invaluable in helping me move forward on my journey of becoming the best me I can be!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Minus one star for the super annoying membership upgrade ad. Update (10/10/19): - Do something about the intrusive ads, please. They interrupt me as I type an entry. - Minus 2 stars now coz of the way the ads are displayed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep records or journal with photos and custom tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love the layout and keeps me journaling consistently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great! Helps me with spiritual and emotional discipline!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Diary all of them 😍😍😍💘💘💞💞"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Too many pop ups, I get you need to make money, but every time I open the app is a bit much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Most of what I like is it's flexibility"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice day to day activities keeping app. Using it for a year now. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has so far been the best journal app I have used for Android . Never crashes or loses any of my data. Daily reminders are great to help start the habit of journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great alternative to Facebook for keeping and remembering pictures, with throwback photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app. It's sophisticated and comfortable. Feels like a real diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have got a question. I am trying to journal in my own language which is Farsi or you call it Persian. We write from right to left. However, I am not able to change text direction. Is it there any way to do that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app !!! I like syncronising , adding weather, photos and video. Easy to find previous entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app for your memorable moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to remind yourself to be grateful with words and pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. No clutter."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep details of everything I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like it myself"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best Journaling apps out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved this app, until it mysteriously disappeared off my tablet, taking the previous month's entries with it. I had even repeatedly verified that my entries were in the cloud, but now they're gone and customer support refuses to get back to me, after repeated attempts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I used it to track my dreams and it's extremely easy to navigate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is what i need it's really cool?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Would like to see the online version work as smoothly & simply as the mobile version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for years. It makes appreciating my progress easier. I am able to see my journey (no pun intended) in a way I couldn't before. It is easier than a hand written journal and is excellent for a safe space to store photos that I hold close to me or impacted me in ways I needed further processing. As cheesy as it may sound- Journey is always there, free, and accessible to safely and confidently vent/process/document my experiences. Don't pass this up. You deserve to know you 💜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just an easy journaling app, nothing to fluffy but just right"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice minimal app for journaling. Not aggressive with the notifications so I keep it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am very dissatisfied with this app. The prompts from the coach are subpart at best. I have requested a refund and have submitted several requests for a refund. I was contacted and told that I would only be contacted if my refund is approved. I would like an email if my refund is not approved stating why it was not approved. As of now I believe that this company is fraudulent due to their refund policy and the run around that I have received."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy this app, and I like how some of the data analysis works. I just wish they weren't so pushy about ""upgrades"" since I am already a ""lifetime premium"" member. Just let me use the service. Stop trying to extract money out of me for features I'm not interested in using."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Eau to use, does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gives you all u want"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Useful. But am wondering how can I export it for backup. Not certain whether there is such option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal to have. Reminders and what you did! Can attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Its not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app I don't want to stop writing In it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No problems yet I love it haven't bought the total package yet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very happy with the app, been using daily for nearly two years and has been frustration free. I would like there to be a way to save location names which I can easily reuse each day, because the GPS is not always accurate (or at least a way to change location on multiple entries at once to save time). Also, printing multiple days to PDF can be temperamental - the days at the end of my selected range are not always included. Other than these minor things it's perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app and have paid for premium. I like it very much. I'm just wondering why there have been so many updates recently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is really helpful to get my willies out and can't trust to tell my co-workers. It's been a good tool for reflection and has helped me get through bad depressive episodes, and toxic relationships. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this journal app. it takes a little while to learn how to use some of the features but when I learn I'm glad and it's helpful. I also hope though that it can save my password I refused the offer yesterday but I hope I can get it back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been looking for a diary app to replace Windows Journal that is now a security risk. What I found was this app which is sooo much better! It allows me to use my phone or laptop and provides other unique features Ex: passcode with fingerprint feature, import, cloud, auto temp, location, tags to group like writings, easy to include photos and a throwback feature plus much more. Thank You ""Two App Studio""! I added the ability to enter my diary on my laptop & phone. Another GREAT FEATURE!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Theraputic and non profit"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Devs, you need to stop this practice of obnoxious notifications. It really is annoying. UPDATE: even with notifications turned off via Android settings, this app still obnoxiously sends unwanted pop-ups while you're using other apps (in my case, while watching YouTube videos). This almost behaves like malware. Removed the app and reported."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"stores my favourite memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful for those who wants to express theirs daily activities and feelings. It's helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far so good, its still early on and havent utilized all the functions but I really like it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful for keeping track on one's life. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Im writing for my doctorates and it's very organized!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app but they need to figure out their notifications. If I journal on the desktop version, I still get an app notification saying ""long time no see"". It's a disjointed cross device experience. Also, getting a notification after I take a photo on my phone, asking to add it to Journey is an overreach. No, not every photo I take I want to upload to journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having a private place to put my life down in a secret place . Thank you Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Works as advertised, but the Android app has weird text editor bugs. For example, if you have several paragraphs, position the cursor at the beginning of the second paragraph, then hit the backspace key. The cursor will jump a character. Another example, when editing an existing journal entry, you have to swipe down three times before it will actually let you scroll the text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice Layout, Features, Seems More Secure. You can feel it. Like no packets of information is being transmitted out of your phone into the airwaves. That whatever is on your phone, stays, & cloud activated. Otherwise, i would write in a composition notebook and send it to a publishing company, page by page. Thanks for putting this out there. Keep developing, try a word document software. One feature i wouls add is the choice to display a picture on the journal entry itself, instead of attached"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app might be the most friendly diary out there. Journaling really does help you become a better person, and thank God for this app. Might avail for the in app purchases soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I got charged for app and I don't even have it installed anymore!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very intuitive app with journaling reminder. The daily prompt is great. I now journal daily. I love the sync to google drive and with all my devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Everytime I open the app there is an screen telling me to upgrade. And when I click close there is an ad bottom on the screen that you cant even close."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal app on Android"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I just want to know if it possible to purchase this program by monthly subscription instead of the annual subscription? This seems to be the app for me, but I'd rather pay by the month. I like the convenience of being to pay for what I actually use when I use it. If I'm not engaging with the program for 2 or 3 months or more, that's just money wasted in my opinion. I've attempted to chat online w/someone, however, the hours of operation are kinda wonkey, and no one has responded as of yet. Has anyone been successful in communicating with the developers of this app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great except for the fact that if I'm gonna play audio memos when the screen times out the audio stops playing even navigating to a different app stops audio from playing. This is a basic feature. Please allow background audio playback."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary and personal journal app ever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the Journey app. It's a great alternative to DayOne, which I think most people seem to think is the only journaling app out there. However Journey has so many features that makes journaling a breeze."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They do not provide refunds even when requested within 48h of purchase as per their policy. Not only that, but they also do not provide a reason for rejecting the refund. Their customer service is terrible and they do not follow through on their policies."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have massive TBI, severe memory issues. Use daily for memory aid. 0"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"All good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy, solid. I use the microphone record feature to dictate ideas to myself"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A 5 STAR"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app I can access via all my gadgets, even emal. It logs location also and shows a map of the places you have been. It gives daily reminder so if busy you don't forget. Not many fonts to choose from but a few. Would be nice to have more text options ie colour change, underline. (but that's just me lol 😂)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In depth and a pleasure to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy way to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, user friendly, lots of useful features. Be cautious however as memberships and lifetime premium accounts can be a bit confusing at first, but it makes sense in the end."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use Pretty interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Full star if only i can attach pdf or other document file.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used this app for a few years now, but I have to say the current incarnation is a retrograde step. I am used to entering markdown codes as I type and seeing them rendered when I save. Now i have to jump through hoops to get the codes recognised and then they get hidden so I can't edit them. There is an option to enter them using buttons which is great, and the live preview is great **but** don't make it harder to edit. Then in night mode the spell checker shows no words so is unusable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple but powerful diary app. Moved over from Daylio and appreciate the cross platform syncing features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Waiting for multiple journal update and I can only see a limited portion of my gallery when I try to add pictures. Once these are fixed I'll give 5 Stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly and good user interface. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Purchased Premium features are lost after updates due to multiplicity of accounts registered with Google play store, but they can be restored by correctly following the help procedure mentioned within the app. But why can't the app remember the email used in previous setup to avoid this exercise? If that was taken care, I would have given 5-stars to the app. Till then 4-stars are enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent interface. Can attach pics & files. Sync across devices. Many other excellent features. Wishlist - ability to enter information upon opening an established day and not having to tap the write icon everytime. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it because you can sync it across all devices. Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My new mission is using this daily. Wish me luck!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"While most things are in place. Can't put my finger exactly but there is scope for improvment in the design. Partly while listing the entries what you highlight.. Having an optional heading for each article will make a big difference."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"There is a smol issue, whenever I copy/cut and then paste stuff during editing, after the paste, my virtual keyboard closes automatically instead of remaining open. The app also adds additional empty lines between lines of words while copy and pasting chunks of text. Huawei Mate 20 used. Edit on 30/9/19: emailed Journey staff regarding the earlier problem about not being able to swipe up and down for 1-2s after trying to edit a journal, no reply. Edit on 2/10/2019: still no reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal / diary app for Android. So flexible, constant updates, works across multiple platforms and is super solid. Well worth the yearly subs. If you're serious about journaling and documenting your life, textually, pictorally, audibly or using all 3 in one entry, then this is absolutely the best option. Love it.... And thanks to the Devs for this amazing app. ☺"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a fantastic app. I use it every day to record the memorable moment of my day. I love the way you can attach a photo to your text entry. I also like the way I can back up all my journey entries to my laptop. A great app. The support service via email and chat is also fantastic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed, a place to jot down daily journaling. More functions than I use; perhaps one day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favourite app for keeping record of what I do or I think at a certain moment in life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it it's orginzeable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app for keeping day to day stuff. Does everything I need and does it well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had so many many issues with it and i reported them but i didn't got a Reply Worst Customer Care For Premium Members People please Switch to ""Journal It"" It has way more features than Journey App and They Even Have A Facebook Group where They help u, and even u can suggest them what to add And your every comment is been seen and liked or replied by the developer of that app... ""Journal It"" Is Way More Better Than Any App On Play Store Journey -Worst Customer Support ( To Premium Members)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have this app just sitting on my phone not only unable to be used because a pin is needed when i never created one. I cancelled my subcription for this app & was still charged for the annual cost I emailed minutes after for a refund. Got no response. It overdrew my bank account so i paid $35 on top of the app cost I never wanted to pay I emailed about being unable to use this app I PAID FOR after cancelling because a pin # I DID NOT create. So this app just sits on my phone useless & paid for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A really useful app that gives you an easy way to record your thoughts when you want or need to, just try it👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best out there in play store. But I will really appreciate if the limit of 10 photos per entry were to increase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"One form of the desktop app seemed to have been discontinued -- I still have many entries in my local app on Mac (from last year Sep-Oct) that are sitting there. I hope one day they can be uploaded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Muito bom"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed! Easy to use and great features. Love that it can connect to drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is good for journaling in general , but make an option to allow for creating seperate journals for various purposes. And the activities associated with moods is not really useful ,allow users to add custom activities so as to get useful insights in mood tracking and also adding custom moods will also be appreciated."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good interface. Hreat way to create bullet list's and wright down thoughs as they happen. Photo capture is a nice feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish i could give this more than 5 stars. After buying the lifetime subscription i fell in love with this app. The tags make it easy to journal and note on several topics and times of day. Also a huge fan of dark theme."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me keep track of my depression. Typing the reactions of my loved ones and their feelings when I decided that I wanted to end it. Journey helped me realize how important my life is. I can type my happiest to my sadest moments and it keeps those toughts private. In a way I can vent without fear of making anyone feel worried. I liked it so much that I purchased the subscription too. This app's been a blessing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for the full access which didn't provide me with the things I expected. This app is very poorly put together. I contacted them to ask for a refund and STILL haven't heard back from them. I DO NOT recommend. If zero stars was an option, thats what this app would get!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've started adding pictures every day. Love the looking back on previous years every day. I've started going back and putting in entries from my old written journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recently tried the free version of Journey and within two weeks I had purchased a year-long subscription. Now, 2 months later, the only regret I have is not trying Journey sooner. It is, wothout any doubt, a top 5-star app as of 10/2019. I very much hope it will continue to deserve 5 stars, which, imho, for a phone/tablet app like Journey, means the dev team needs to improve current features, add features the current users have asked for, and keep the current user's data safe & secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the voice to text option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"APlikasi yang enak untuk menulis jurnal. Saya masih menggunakan versi gratisnya, tapi beberapa kali mendapatkan tawaran diskon sampai jadi Rp 70 ribuan. Tapi belum saya gunakan, nanti saja kalau sudah akan transfer data, yang mana membutuhkan akun premium untuk melakukannya. Update 29 September 2019 Masih bagus, dan sering dapat tawaran diskon 40%. Sangat menggoda."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my goto journal app. Very user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A year ago when I reviewed this, I asked if there would be a easier way to format my font. A couple months later, they implemented it! Right now, it's a pretty awesome app! You can't get it any easier to be encouraged to journal and self reflect. You can include reminders, add photos and geotag locations. Without this app, I probably would have journaled once a month. But with this, I am encouraged to journal almost every day! At the end of the year, I usually like to export my journal entries in PDF and save them. (However, the exported journal entries when it comes to photos isn't that well structured. It's pretty messy.) Not a deal breaker, but might be if you're trying to print them. Overall, I like this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the way it works. The only problem is that i need to purchase again if i want to use Journey in the desktop version. 9/10 Stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutlely the best! Would reccomened it to anyone anytime! 🖤XOXO🖤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wish you could have more than one journal type coach."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Update, will upgrade for sure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like. Don't ever change it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really appreciate this app. It becomes the place where I can spill all of my thoughts, feelings, and dreams."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have purchased this product and I very happy with it..! 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't get fooled into paying for this junk. It's a basic text editor. WARNING Don't make the mistake I did and pay the annual subscription on the extended STARTUP! I emailed them within 2 minutes explaining the accident and that I want to at least try it first THEY WILL NOT REFUND ANYONE. I got an email conveniently after the Google T&Cs expired saying they'd rather say no and settle later in court, it's a bad attitude to have and should not be tolerated or encouraged by using this application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, simple , easy interface and the ads are not pushy, good job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am from Nepal and can't upgrade the app to premium because payments at Google Play is blocked in Nepal. Can you please help me to upgrade the app? The current limited version is not that useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great. I read the privacy policy. You take some information from us. Can you read the text which we write in the app. Where is the backup storage for the texts. Thank you. Edit: Who decided to put a hideless button at the buttom of the page for upgrading. I don't want to see this button in main page. I don't want to upgrade for now. If I change my decision, I can look setting of app. The button doesn't need to wait me to change my idea at the bottom of the page."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great to have a place that I can write down my thoughts so I can revisit it later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for my holiday journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice way to save and remember things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Offers nothing special you can't get in other apps, except they want you to pay a subscription... for a journal... No."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So, if I buy the premium am I still going to get annoying notifications? Update : Love this app. Support was very helpful with a problem I was having downloading backup to my New phone. Now I have eliminated all other note apps and diary apps. Everything is right here in Journey. It's the best. No glitches."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its quite fun to use this, its simple and nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is really convenient and beautifully designed. I've used it for quite a while and I love it. My only problem is with the Premium advertisement. On one screen, it says that there's a 40% discount offer that ends in some hours, on the next one, it's 20% discount offer that ends tomorrow. It may say 'Once this card is dismissed, the offer will expire' but you'll get the same card, like, three times a day. I understand you guys need to make money, but this really does make a bad impression."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's so easy to use. I dont use it every day, but I always come back to it. I've tried other journal apps, but this is definitely the best I've found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Purchased Premium for Reason. Great App. Journal Writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Edit: The app is pretty useful, looks nice and offers everything you need to keep your journal/diary up to date. I had originally a problem with this app. It didn't accept the membership I paid for and pestered me to pay for it again and again. Restore purchase didn't make any difference and Play Store showed subscription active. Well, I am now on my new device and the membership works. No idea why it didn't work on my old phone, but on this one it's ok, hence the added stars in its rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The format makes it easy for me to actually journal in real time. Adding pictures and words across devices like a text message for my future self. I don't use the coaches but if I lose motivation it is helpful to know about"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this up, very nice and convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great way to keep records. Changed phone twice. Everything was carried over smoothly. Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've gotten the opportunity to get the more premium version of this app thanks to a sale and it was so worth it. After using it for a while it dawned on me that I got this for a steal as the features are so worth it on mobile! Definitely my number one journaling app and also good for just casual note taking thanks to tagging of entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I hope to do list can be added in future update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Like many other apps you have to pay for long term"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I think this is a great app however you can't attach files like PDF's or Office documents to your entry so it won't work for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has transformed my journaling habits for the better! The design is clean and beautiful, and I don't have to worry about losing journal entries ever! The throwback feature is super neat too, I can see and read about how far I've come in my own journey of life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I don't remember subscribing to this service, have not used it and when I tried to cancel it, it charged my sister's card. I did not intend to renew the subscription since I didn't even recognize the application. Somehow my sister accidentally merged her account with mine. I was trying to remove her card from my account and it CHARGED her card instead. The charge JUST came through, causing massive turmoil. CAN YOU PLEASE CANCEL IMMEDIATELY AND REFUND HER MONEY?? PLEASE?? We're both on fixed income and cannot afford this. Please, please, please help me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well for me. I appreciate both the automatic dating and the ability to change the date and time of an entry. I would really like to have the ability to add and customize other rating scales - if you don't want to use 'mood' you're kind of stuck. Being able to export the data from those scales would be helpful, too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and efficent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really appreciate Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I never had time to use it. But I was told that you were going to love it. So here's to my beginning. Let us start now. I'll be back with my honest opinion 😉😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app to write about special moment of our lives..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this for quick notes with Astronomy and bird watching.Wish it had a Linux version. I'm any case it is definitely worth the price. EDIT: Shortly after I posted this I discovered the Linux version and purchased it. Now I keep it synced with the phone app and use it to transcribe notes from the field to my primary journaling environment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Easy to use!! Blessing for my book!! ;-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Makes normal journalling and photo journaling a breeze."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great experience of using this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and records what 8 want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Works as advertised. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. I USE IT EVERY DAY"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free, feels like a cheat when you don't state your intentions upfront."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple app. Intuitive interface. Tools extra for each entry. So far I liked it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is awsome! So many handy tools and options. If you have multiple devices you always have access to your data is always available on your device(s)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome.... Best way to keep memories...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great, straight forward App. The free version is adequate - some of the formatting options are only available in the pay app...yet it doesn't take away from it in any significant way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best..just best....GREAT INTERFACE , what great efforts have been gone in to making this AWESOME app...✌️👍🙏.....keep creating such wonderful apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great as a journal. Your latest entiries come up so you can open any one or easily scroll down for previous entries. Hit the plus sign and start writing for today. Easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app to note day today routine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has postive impart in my life, as well very resourceful as well as good new habit and hobby to take on board in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far very good. Google FIT link doesn't seem to be picking up any data. ????."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought the app thinking they are offering so much. But after paying the one time charge. They are asking for more money monthly. There is no difference between pro or not. I tried contacting them cause they have a policy to ask for a refund in 48 hours but i asked for the refund in just 15 mins after paying money. No reply from there side till now. Go for Diaro. Its way better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"sadly the app gets a 1 star for being greedy. i bought this app a while back and should get my premium ""unlocking everything"". but not anymore. they now have a monthly membership giving all the same stuff i have plus more. i paid thinking i would get everything the app offers for life because thats how they made it sound. sadly thats not the case. Edit: obviously you didn't read what I said. This is not a developer issue."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. It seems like it's this updated journal but there are many free journals on here that are better. I removed my review once because the seller said that was the only way to receive a refund but since they are not refunding anything I would like to help others save $. Find a free app or purchase a composition book and look up prompts on Pinterest. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal with private features. I like that it tells you where you were too, helps with recalling a moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have learned to like the app. Wished it allowed for you to add more pictures!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall the function of this app is great, the flexibility and in-app transition are smooth, premium version totally worth it, keep up the good work guys!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I would really like to know if there is a word count limit on this app beacuse ever since the update in august its been super slow for me and ive emailed you guys on how slow it was before but nobody got back to me on it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good to be your everyday diary 🙃"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Seems there still is a risk that Google would read my diary stored in the Google drive if they choose to do evil. Ideally only encrypted message should be stored in Google drive, and the encryption key should be stored in journey's server. The performance cost of encryption/decryption on the edge is worthy to pay to protect such sensitive information as a user's diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for this lifetime membership and I can't even sign in using my Google account any more.. Its rubbish and if I new how to get a refund I most definitely would"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too detailed for my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. What else can I say? This app is awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have to tell somebody my mind. I cannot tell everybody my mind, because everyone has a mind and they want to listen to them. I listen to them. I tell my mind to journey as I wish. I sometimes talk my mind. I have my 'journey app' both in my android and iOs device. I tell my mind as I please. Well designed and my appreciation to the team ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite app everrr!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very well-done app. A great way to keep a journal and track thoughts and mood."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I mostly use it for shopping list but it does a good job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cheated, without any notice deducted my money Rs. 2550 from my credit card through google play"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works great, fast, easy to use and sync to Google drive for storage of the Journal. For the security minded person, this app is open to pillaging by anyone including government accessing the content. There should be an end to end encryption feature that prevent the app developers, contractors and government agencies from accessing the content of the Journal. After all, this is personal writings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App is only a diary not a bullet journal as it is in the search. Can't do anything but regular diary entries NOT even sub journal like a weekly and under that have things for the week, and daily for daily, can't print to pdf. I do like they are Christian and will change rating and use when app is updated and has more options in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love everything about this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I wanted,used every day,luv it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, use it all the time easy to use. I love that I can either do a video, audio or just type my entry. Highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never failed me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just did my first journal entry and I found this very easy and simple to use I will probably upgrade to the full version if it keeps going so well. Owning an iPad as well I wanted to use that version just for convenience over using the phone. Shame it's only for those who have iOS 11 upwards. So I'm having to use the cloud version but this doesn't give me the full access of the app version. So two stars deducted for falling into Apples trap over non current tech."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"constant ads everytime you open app, pushing you to purchase every single time, annoying as hell when trying to capture a moment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Why is the app not syncibg with my email"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app! Easy to use and easy to share what J have written"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being able to put down thoughts and memories with photos and date-time stamps with geolocate. All great features, but best of all is that you can export and use these thoughts to pen your autobiography."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant just perfect companion for my ""go-to-sync-across-device-and-platform"" journal. Just wished I got this app way back since 2001. Must have got my most comprehensive life journal up till this moment. Anyway, big ups to dev. Keep up the good work. Worth upgrading for lifetime addon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App is okay for journalling, not great I wish that I could have a couple of different, separate, journals. The tags do an okay job but not great Also the typing doesn't have as many options as I'd like and regularly has glitches (like when I go to move some typing from one place to another and it selects more than I had selected and moves random things around)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing! I love how I can include pictures with my diary entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful & useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for almost two years and its truly the best. Upgraded after a few months of use and its worth every penny. Super easy to use, past notes/photos are all easily accessible and I can upload or change themes quickly. Its wonderful to be able to see notes and pics you uploaded from a year or two ago so easily. You can literally see the trajectory of your work or personal life. Its awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The most annoying call to actions in terms of trying to pursue you to get premium account. Literally every launch of the app, sometimes even more during one launch"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it as a journal of random thoughts from engineering to ramblings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was writing a long story for a future film of a dream I had and the app suddenly closed. I lost my entire story thanks a lot journey F U for not having recovery options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lots of useful features, especially in the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so much I purchased app. Never any problems with it. It a live Scrape Book that never fades away, has a throw back moment from year to date events and is always backed up from old phone, Tablet or computer to new tech. Once you use it you can't go without it. I just love it💋"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, powerful to leverage!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App does what I expect it to do and developers are continously improving the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to enter data and easy to find. Also like that it can use biometrics to secure. Just wish the save function was a little less obscure than a checkmark, but that's just my opinion. Once figured out, it works fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The details and description of this app do NOT include the VERY important fact that you can only use this app free for 1 week. Extremely disappointed and uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app. There are options of a monthly and yearly membership. I joined monthly but did not realise I had to actively cancel yearly, even though I chose monthly. It then charged me for yearly with no way of getting my money back. So I am $45 out of pocket for an app I will not use. I want my money back!! Buyer beware!!!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great space to be mindful of my day. I love that I can add photos and webpage/YouTube links."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It's been great for journaling. The reminders are a great encouragement."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Отличное приложение для ведения дневника."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you for the nice app. Thanks a lot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fun, can edit entries in many ways"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it just felt a bit forceful to upgrade. But I think it's worth the price. My favorite feature is the night mode and throw backs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful and a joy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Earlier it was good...i changed my mobile and lost all my memorable notes eventough i synced them...didnt expect it from Journey..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't install at all. I had this app at a five star rating last year and within the past few months, they'd been really pushing the premium subscription. When I had to reinstall it, they forced me to sign up for a free trial to install it at all, when for the year I used it prior to this, it was free. Today I woke up and they took most of my paycheck to pay for a subscription I never had to have before. It's whatever. A refund would be nice but judging by the other reviews on here, I know better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect journal. Couldn't ask for more"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app. I and keep track of my goals and type down my private thoughts. Also I track my bill to my grocery list"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dear developer team, Pl add a feature for a kind of WISH LIST."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keep my memory in mobile and desktop devices effectively"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good, but a day ahead every morning reminder"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be great if the design look like a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How did this app get an editor's award? The encryption scheme is offensively moronic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App has a nice interface and synchronization works flawlessly. However the main reason I bought it was the companion Chrome app, which has then been replaced with a very simplistic web version, which does not even let me change the entry date from the current date. I know there is a PC version but no way I'm going to pay a subscription to access to my own data in GDrive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent diary! I love it! I love that the devs are always featuring new functions and ways to motivate us to write, which is an excellent exercise! The premium is totally worth it. Very goodlooking and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful for every day use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I want in a journaling app! Would love to know if there is an easy way to eventually compile all entries in order in a pdf format? Ideally with capabilities for editing, or perhaps editing happens before the pdf stage"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!!!🥰🥰🥰"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Don't ever remove this app from play store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is a great app especially if you haven't done journaling before. It's simple and you can set up reminders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for night mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please make a YouTube video !! It would be awesome !! ♥️😊 The throwback section is awesome. It helps me remember the learnings of my life in the previous years. Please also add a random throwback entry. It would benefit in learning from life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"handy to use also for business and planing your daily/weekly life.. other words it is great in my opinion .. many uses besides a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"other than the constant popups for their premium service its alright! hot tip: if I did want the premium service 1 popup per day would do! not a popup every single time I open the app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favourite journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very well built app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've paid for Premium Lifetime. But every time they make an update, I get knocked off to no membership. I have tried the restore button but nothing happens. I have uninstalled the app and reinstall it and it works but it takes about an hour to sync my 4500 or so entries. I'm not going to uninstall and reinstall it again. They should fix this problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app - I use it to record my children's milestones and to record special days/holidays etc as well as the mundane things that make being a parent so wonderful. I only wish I'd used it since my firstborn was born. I especially love the 'tag' feature - helps me to easily find past posts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for my needs... Would like to save repeat daily activities to have easy save for future activities..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been working reliably across my devices for daily entries of diary, activities, etc. I purchased the ""Life Time premium"" version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for documenting all kinds of things in your life. I use it for documenting vacations, random pictures, even organizing my home. I take pictures of things I love and write a note about them and then give them away. It gives me emotional freedom from the baggage of all the stuff I've had for so many years!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I need my money back took 3o dollars out my account and how do I find the order purchasing number"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good diary app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that it is simple and straight forward."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app to keep everyday on track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I want to love this app more, but can't stand their constant quest to make you spend more money. First I paid to upgrade to premium on my phone so there would be no ads, but if you want to access your entries anywhere else then you need to buy LIFETIME premium which is an additional charge. Or pay a monthly membership, which they are always trying to push on you every time that you use the app. The online version doesn't work and has stopped being supported, so it has little value."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Didn't know this app can sync with other phones & pads, very cool. Free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Lost and can't restore my ""lifetime"" premium even after trying the steps suggested by support and now they won't reply. Lol. *Now they replied and want me to change my review before they help. Nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for journaling. Get the upgrade too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The free version is good enough for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for recording my journal sessions, complete with photos. I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a nice simple no pressure journal. The prompts are really awesome, and I like the feature that allows me to add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been on journal for 4 years now and it's been an amazing experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, been using it for years. I tag all sorts of different entries. It's so intuitive but has everything youd need in a journal app. Almost all of my writing goes through this app first. Thanks for creating it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've come across so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how easy to use it is and how many options you have to add to your journal entries. Really enjoying this app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is very perfect in its journey in delivering experience to its users. We wish journey of free users remain unaffected(wrf to present). Such a beautiful and minimal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems like a great app. The UI is intuitive enough and it seems to sync well across devices. I don't use it enough for the membership or premium features to be worth it to me (even though they are very reasonably priced). I would have given 5 stars except that it's so annoying that every time I open the app, it gives me some deal that I have to dismiss for upgrading to premium or starting a membership. Very annoying. I've even considered paying, just so I don't have to see those popups."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Super, great app, specially the premium version. Only suggestion for now: 1 MAKE THE TAG NAMES EDITABLE. As far as I see, it is not possible to modify a Tag's name, and this is a MUST. 2 Make it also possible to export the entire data base, not only checked tags. If not for the above, I'd give it starts. I'll be waiting for you changes... Good job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to record your special moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"(2016) - This is a must have app!! Kudos to the developers 2019 review - still a great app. bought a new phone and i think i bought it twice! haha"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved this app for its markdown support. But now, I can't export as markdown! I'm not sure if I'll continue using it or not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've uninstalled this. I don't mind discreet ads but every time I log on it is asking me to. upgrade. Too annoying to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love the tagging of location and the mood icon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A nice app to write your life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the journalling. Finally something easy i can stick to for streaming thoughts and feelings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Make it so we could use password instead of just 4 digit pin to make it more secure. Also even though it's locked, it still shows the content when I press recent apps. That is not good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and looks great 👍 i decided to pay for full features as it's worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well and can even dictate to it. Just found that the entry date can also be modified (for the stuff you forgot). Liking this app even more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"To costly to buy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't post my life on social media but it would be nice to journal memories to look back on them or pass them on. This seems perfect for that. I think its worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has really helped me to vent out my feelings. It is easier to use than actual pen and paper since it is in my phone. Thumbs up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far the best Journal app,its so convienient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Still learning, wondering if i can have separate journals. And now, it says i am inputting the wrong passcode, where do i reset it? help!! Update! I love this journal! I advocate its use and the developers are friendly, helpful and witty!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really enjoy Journey and I've been using it for about a couple of years now. It's aesthetically pleasing and soothing and the latest editor features are fantastic. What I don't like about it are the costs for accessing the different platforms. When I first started using Journey, I unlocked premium membership for the Android app only to find out that I had to pay for the Chrome app, which I did. Recently, I learned that if I want to use the web version, then I have to pay again. It's unfair."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a pretty good app, i like it very much. Well done developers, it's a fabulous piece of work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty thorough journey easy to use I like it a lot This is really a fantastic app it has a lot of add on and it's nice to keep a log on what you doing everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this diary and I hope the price drops down much more 🤭🤭"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the only journey app I use. It does what it does, no complaints and like its useful features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job and does it well!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this app for 2 days and so far it's a wonderful experience, especially with the additional features like the Gratitude Journal and others that I have not even used yet. I'll do a further review after a month or two. I'm finding this very useful to coordinate with my calendar. The journal is excellent. Love the picture and video features. Also time&temp. Can assess&review my progress. I'm transferring text messages which record significant comments which might otherwise be forgotten."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Poor for me. A lot of self-advertisement in the app, absolutely unfunctional web-version, and they are here to propose desktop-version, for additional money, of course. They want to monetize the product so much, that they created different plans, ""aggressively"" promoting the app, saying now or never when proposing to buy it. Such attitude to customers is inappropriate, as for me. I've bought lifetime license, not realizing the complex character of tariffs. (Downgraded, the answer is unrelevant)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been incredible taking inventory of my life and journey with this amazing App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love everything except for when it comes to printing an entry with pictures. If I have more than one picture attached, it prints them jumbo size and results in multiple pages printed where everything could fit on one page if it was more customizable. Would love to print every day for our family book, so please fix or let me know how to if I am missing something. Thanks !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Having used Jotterpad, I know these folks make good software and the premium was worth it for cross platform sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Invasive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"this app is really amazing. I have lifetime membership on it. the only and only worst thing is when is comes to export and you want to save all of your tags you have only two possibility SELECT NONE or SELECT ALL 100s OF THEM ONE BY ONE. and this really sucks. that is why I am giving it 1 star otherwise it ia worth more then 5 star."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was through this product that I've learnt to keep Journal. No fuss you can just get on with it. The more i use it the more i like it. Oh i wish i wasn't so lazy ! Still i make an effort every few days and reading the entries from some years before reminds me how valuable these things are."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is awesome app. I like to dedicate the journal at one app instead of using the note app. It is beacause less distracting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its been two years since i started with journey and the more i use it the more I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Really annoying to use without paying. Watch out, they don't make it explicitly clear that LIFETIME PREMIUM and MONTHLY MEMBERSHIP are totally different, not just different payment models. Very disappointing to be denied features that the website says I have access to, but the support and app does not. Really poor customer service as well. ""Sorry you didn't read all the detailed information on our other pages."" Thanks guys."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good app, I recomend it to anyone who want to improve yourself or just write down your feelings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Apps is good, but still cannot sync with desktop"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"31/07 nothing new & no new changes. Want to buy but cant justify. So after putting in all my future commitments/events in the app every time I open it it shows the last thing I entered. So December it the first thing i see & I have to scroll all the way down & throu everything just to get to today. This is very annoying & boring, I may just return to calendar. So glad I put off paying lifetime premium. Which sadly a lot depends on having. 04/09 paid for it nothing changed still scrolling forever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Doesn't sign in to Gmail from OnePlus 6. I had this app for sometime. Used it on my Xiaomi Note 3 and worked seamlessly.. had stored my memories. Now when changed my phone, it doesn't sync to gmail and everything is gone!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I can understand the need to push in-app purchases. But if you have a free version, do not make it impossible to use it without so many upgrade reminders. It simply starts to get really annoying. If your premium features are not enough for a user to upgrade and you need to annoy them, maybe you need to rethink what is free and what is not. Users, if you are looking for a free app, this is NOT for you. Uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always my go to for personal reflection"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I definitely love this app. It allows me to keep everything in one place it. Allows me to save and email my entries. And a periodically run sales so I ended up buying the unlimited lifetime pass for like 8 bucks. I can post photos and even keep a photo journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is overall good, although there is space for improvement. 2 things that I find important 1; there should've been an option to write a title on every new entry, this way on the preview you would only see the title instead of the first 3 lines of the things you wrote. And 2; when locking, it sometimes doesn't require a password after you exit and re-join(i have timer set to 0) and also if I swipe to the recently used apps, i can clearly read everything because the app doesn't blur it out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is what you make of it. You get out of it what you put into it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"No doubt this is a fantastic app. Except for the price after the 7-day trial. If it was just the $2.50 per month, that would be one thing. But after the trial, you are required to pay that much a month, billed once annually. So if you are planning to stick with this, make sure you're ready to throw down about $30 after the trial. Middle-class and lower-class folk can't afford this, and I'm just mentioning it because that's millions of people y'all are cutting out of enjoying this app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like that its simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is so useful in helping me organise my experiences and reflections on my journey. One of my favourite apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to start writing a diary.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works great on my Samsung tablet. I have the app on my computer, but had to pay extra to input on multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is the best but slill I'm giving 4 out of 5 because the premium verson is so expensive for an student and avarage people. Plz make more fucntion unlock.... Just like the wallpaper...and font style... 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"HOW CAN I DELETE MY ACCOUNT?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love the app, paid 8 bucks for a lifetime subscription then I look today and saw they took out 29.99 dollars. Dont be me wrong 30 bucks isnt a lot but when you have no job, 30 bucks is a lot. I want to cry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app but would love it completely if I could occasionally print. Looking forward to that day. (Response to answered comment: I meant to say export to Word for further writing and THEN print. Is that in the works?)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Inspires me to put even a short sentence, or a quote I came across, a photo or deeper reflections which I wouldn't save otherwise! It is a powerful tool on my Life Journey. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this journey simple but very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app, you can add pictures, and it auto loads to the cloud so it won't get lost"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Keep a journal now everyday. Great place to keep track of life. Easy to use, good functionality."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app! Cute design and great functionality."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Пользуюсь год. Нравится функия Возврат в прошлое. НЕ нравится то, что к заметке можно прикрепить или фото или видео. Нельзя и то и то. Также не нравится ограниякние в 10 фото на заметку. Но всё равно 5 звезд. Ну может четыре с половиной :-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Looks really great. However, you can only add one photo at a time and the app is really pushing you to buy the premium version with its ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great place to put down my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app to store everyday events. The only problem is passcode. The correct passcode logs you in automatically without the need of pressing the tick. Someone could easily try combinations of random passcodes without pressing tick and eventually the correct passcode will log him in. All in all its a good app but easy to hack."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Upgrade offer is a total scam I have paid them to get the 50% off for upgrade, but not upgraded at all. I asked them to give me what they claim I can get with the money or refund, but after waiting for a week, no refund at all, and no upgrade either. Very disappointed with their customer service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has a lot of functionality. One of the great features is that if you create an entry and attach a photo, it will prompt you if you want to change the entry timestamp to that of the photo. What a great idea! I am a tour bus driver and I take a lot of photos but rarely have time to create a journal entry until later. Problem solved with this feature! Also has great editing tools."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A truly enjoable app. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Though a wonderful app but off lately it is not allowing me to share the entry, which is annoying as i would like my thoughts to be shared"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seamless journal entries. Easy to attach photo/video or even start an entry from a photo you just took by ""sharing"" with the journey app. Optional ""coaching"" feature has a variety of themes and sends a daily prompt, e.g. gratitude journal. Worth the upgrade cost. Very fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much I bought the premium version! Have tried several journaling apps but this one is amazing and perfect for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Uninstall means cancel 7-day trial? Or there are extra steps I need to take?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bought the lifetime version and couldn't be happier. I am keeping a journal of my kids growing up and love that I can export it, add videos and pictures and location tag my posts. Now I will never have to guess how old they were when they took their first steps!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use, really good with the talk to text thing,I'm hoping that there's some things that I can do with this app that I haven't discovered if it works out we'll go back and do five."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and keep record."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"new update don't save the content. almost half of the content gets auto deleted. it is irritating to write same thing again. developer please solve this major flaw in new version as quickly as possible. Edit- problem solved. Thank you. It is working smoothly now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app was trying to upsell too much. Even before I could jot down my first entry it had shown me two different offer for paid features. It also created a fake urgency with a clock ticking against one of the offer. Seriously!? 🙄 Let users use your app once before asking them to pay."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple of use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Mobile app always ask to subscribe to premium when i open the app, annoying and distracting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, but two things. It is constantly asking me to upgrade, even though I already did in Dec. 2018 to the $29.99/yr one with all the frills. Yet, I'm not receiving everything I paid for. This is disappointing because I really like this app. Now I have to question whether those things actually come with the app since I am getting some things but not the others. Should have known since I still receive sales ads from Journey everytime I log on? I'm willing to update rating if resolved!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use, love the navigation which is a bit like a blog."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool app.. i use it everyday for recording my thoughts & what's happening.. also i like throw back feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app which I have been using to write a daily journal entry. My only issue is with one of the more recent updates. When I add paragraphs to the entry and look at it on my computer, it shows the 

& 
as if it's directly copying the HTML code over. I'm not sure if this is a simple coding bug or whatever, but it makes the appearance on the computer look extremely messy. Hope this gets fixed soon, love the app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not very pleased right now. I downloaded this app and tried it, realized I really didnt have time for all of this and uninstalled it. 3 weeks later, I check my bank account balance and I'm overdraft because of this app. There were 3 attempts to take this money I didnt authorize and no where does it say to pay. On the 3rd time it went through. Why?? It seems to me that this has happened to other people! Please refund the $30 charge and the $30 for overdraft!! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app!!! Not only can you write about your day or anything that's going on, but you can put your memories in it. So you can look back at both the good and the bad. The photo part is the best. I can go and add photos from either my vacation, funny things that has happened or hobbies that I follow. My only complaint is when you are making an entry with multiple photos, (which you can only add 10 in at a time) you can't add ""comments"" to each photo. You can only write them in the entry, which is a bummer because certain photos have stuff that you would want to write something specifically under it. The other thing is, for your entries you can only sort them by the date. I wonder if there is a way that maybe we can put either a ""bookmark"" or save option to be able to see them in a file on another tab. For instance, if you are posting pictures/entries about a hobby you follow you can go right to the ""folder"" and see all of them right there. Other than that, I highly recommended this app to anyone who would like to have the best journal/memory maker!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nica app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app. Love being able to click on the calendar and see what I've done in the past. Very helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app does not support landscape mode?! a u srs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is fantastic I love this thank journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"No email when you sign up detailing your actually only on a 7 day trial and if you don't cancel before that 7 days you will automatically be charged for a 1 year subscriitption. I had no knowledge of this until I noticed a payment from my bank. Of course because i did not cancel they are now saying I cannot have a refund. Worst customer service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is an excellent journalling app which makes daily tracking life's journey simple and easy to do. It syncs across devices very well and has an engaging interface. Very pleased to have discovered this app and look forward to using it for many years to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey! I love the way it syncs to my other devices. It's just a very simple way to write about my day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The Best App for Journaling! I cant imagine anything better than this app! I love the simplicity, easy interface, customization, no annoying ads whatsoever (I bought premium out-the-gate so I'm not sure about the free side), and the pay once and have it forever unless you chose to buy a $2 membership for addons that arent nessesity but can be a nicety depending on your purpose/goals using the app. I've used this app everyday for the past year and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome, except after 1000 words, in one entry, it gets really laggy? & Sometimes glitchy, maybe needs to use more memory or ram to deal with my big rightings? Please fix, as i use this everyday, for my wrightings, & wrighting long texts, i have to wait minuets for it to catch up, so i can see whats riten? Please fix🍀 thanks for the awesome platform though🍀✌️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is a lot of fun and I enjoy it very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I tried another journey app, and in the end , I decide this app is the best for me! I just hope the development add ""hastag"" feature. It is quit hard to track down what I do without hastag feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really THE best journal app out there!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Used to really like this app when I first started using it 4 years back. The ads didn't use to be so intrusive, which makes it annoying whenever I want to use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, non intrusive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a free day to day log of everything I put in it! Works nicely and is expandable at a low cost. I haven't bothred with the cost part yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All you could want in a simple journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job i want. I reccomend putting in the extra few dollars to get the permanent perks. Whenever I have goals or desires i write them down to make them into reality. To keep myself in check. Super convenient and simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not very user friendly initially, constantly trying to get you to sign up for a paid monthly subscription billed annually without really giving you a chance to try it out and see if it's worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used apt of journaling apps. This one is the best! It's simple, so when you have a quick thought, or you're tired and about to sleep It's super easy to use. I love the features that premium gave me and they are ones I actually want to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Paid for premium app. Focused only on audio journals that would sync to my google drive and also do voice-to-text. Making the audio file was easy. First one saved and was retrievable on my device, but didn't sync to cloud. Made three more tests. They didn't save on my device or my cloud, and so weren't retrievable. Help thru the app didn't address retrieval or syncing. No chat help on weekends. Couldn't find google info or youtube videos with how-to for retrieval or syncing. For voice journaling, it is not"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This a great way to keep memories of day to day life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love it! Coffee °¬°"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I love being able to have attachments. Great way to jounal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yap.. It's true. I write regularly in my journal. And you now what? It's great! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, I wish it had a quick mood tracker. Edit- But I am disappointed it doesnt sync with my Google fit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am so happy I found this new version of Journey.However, I was using the old version for Google Chrome and started having problems when I added an update from my phone and saw that the data displayed on the Chrome version had random letters at the beginning and end of my words. Also, I had taken advantage quite a while ago of the Lifetime Membership offer for the old version but sadly lost that when I got this new version from August 2019 and had to pay once again ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for noting down my thoughts, im travelling at the moment so this is a perfect journal for me that doesnt take up any extra space im my bag! I like that it backs up all your journal entries aswell, perfect for my needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy having a customizable journal with coaching and formatting optional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great with Windows"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. Love it! You can get as much as you want from it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Decent app, tho you can do the same thing with Evernote or Keep without the constant pop-ups asking you to buy things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app. It helps me stay focused."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best free app i ever seen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Truly a great app, i love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the only app that I have purchased and have uninstalled the others. It is user friendly, allows you to modify the entry date if an earlier attachment is used. You can also edit earlier entries... Suggest to please add more fonts👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well with great options and performs reliably. God Bless Your success and the Team. Thank You."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I payed for the liferime premium but couldn't do alot of the stuff that was on the app i wasnt going to pay twice for something that i was going to use the help my anxiety and depression."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's such a shame there are so many pop up ads. And the pricing doesn't make any sense. I've tried providing feedback in the app but no changes have been made. It's getting to the point where I'm considering deleting it and finding an alternative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good, minimalistic app four your personal journal. Has all i need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally I manage to keep a journal continuously, thanks in part to this tool as well. Customer support is excellent (Jeromy)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Friends be VERY VERY mindful of this shameless almost predatory, yet legal attempt, to sneak you into your 7 day trial.im not the only one that's bothered by this. Look for the X in the right hand corner to decline. Developers have this beautiful calm loving feel to this, and then they pull this cheap, greasy trick. It contrasts heavily with your entire presentation. It's an insult,and makes it harder to decide on using this. I'll continue w/Evernote for now Otherwise,this is truly 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good experience. Im using journey to save all kinds of data. I really hope it's safe .idk"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Looking forward to doing more with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hy Developers, I love your application Journey Its my favorite app for writing my articles in urdu, but from recent updates i cant write urdu language properly in this app. It starts writing from left to right which is wrong. We write urdu from right to left please solve this problem...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Application constantly offers to buy ""premium"" despite the fact that I was choosing ""I reject this offer"" many times. It's super annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Learning."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So on fleek and does what it does well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write words down and can read them back again. It's not rocket science but does what it says on the tin"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep on track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works great. Love the interface and it's options. I think it's a bit pricey for a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of best note diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have memory impairment and this app really helps. I love that I can take a quick pic and post a little blurb about it and see those lined up at the end of the day. In a quickly readable format, no less. Well worth the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful on many levels. I track my weight. I also jot down observations, thoughts, feelings, and transfer them to my travel stories on Facebook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app; it's user friendly and very neat. Everything works smoothly for me and I've had it for a year. I've never been charged with anything. However I haven't tried to go Pro and it seems like many people have had an issue with this. I haven't had the need for going Pro but should it arise in the future, I would be hesitant to pay because of the negative reviews here. How are you planning to solve the problem? If I pay to go Lifetime Pro, I want to have access to every feature and not be charged with anything again. I understand that you have to cancel your subscription within the 7 day trial period, but that doesn't seem to work either..?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Didn't do what it advertised. Thought it was a routine app, but could only find a place to add journal entries. If there was a scheduling part it was not obvious. Not easy to use. But fantastic idea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome journaling app. Go pro. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"per month payment option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A useful app for writing diary every day. I like the way they sync data between my phone and my pc. Rating 5 stars 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wow! Great app for journaling eith lots of unique,useful features like handy, wellplaced links to your calendar, media, mood keeper and you can even geo-tag locations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app works as advertised, lots of features, highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Customer support staff is awesome. Ellen is the kind lady she helps you throughout. Really a best experience. Overwhelmed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"blah blah of corse u have to pay for so sick off these kind of apps tell aleast befor u down load deleted yup"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Eady to use. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi! can anyone help me? how can I retrieve my entries that I lost? app crashes and when I open it.. Everything was erased! i tried syncing but all it gave me back are entries back on 2016! someone. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it keeps saying I can cancel anytime, then why wont it let me cancel?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am using this app for almost a year now, I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who would like to keep track of thier memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Premium user. It feels like it is constantly reminding you to use it. The app will even interrupt maps while it's giving directions. So dangerous! I wish I never paid for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a little strange subscription implementation but i love the app anyways."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good way to document my journey in life and to have a way to express myself rather than on social media where people are just looking for someone to pounce on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app. Been using it for several years every day with no issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A simple and nice way of recording your journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank-you for quick response.add grid view make it more beautiful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please help! I got a new phone and 4+ years of entries are GONE(!!??) Ihad premium account but my transferred AP keeps asking me to sign in as a new user..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I want to upgrade but through paytm but this option is not there. please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great app but the push to make you buy it is out of control. Had to stop using it which is a shame."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is everything it says it is. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been journaling for years on paper, and took some time to try different apps before committing myself to an electronic solution. I settled on Journey for its simplicity - and because it synchronises so well via Google Drive. The app has other features that I don't use (maybe some day, perhaps?) But it has proved flexible and reliable - and that's what I wanted. Revisiting this review after using the app for several years, I still think it's marvellous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User interface is very friendly. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm trying to cancel my account dont want it and can't afford it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hi.. Just wanna ask.. how to cancel this app so that I won't be charged? Thank you.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple fuss free app for journaling!:) i feel happy using this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"you get your normal journaling experience here and even more but I gave 2 stars because 1. the ""free trial"" is tricky. By clicking it it got me subscribed to the annual membership, which I didn't want. I contacted them for refund but damn it's been so long. All they did ask me to do was cancel subscription in Google store but where's the refund? 2. I found a simpler app that can track both moods and diaries and even to do lists where I don't need to type a lot of things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I write in Journey Daily. It has helped me to grow! I would encourage everyone to give Journaling a try! This app is the best I have found for this purpose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"too much pop up..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic journal. Quick for looking up previous entries. love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it's easy to access as it's on my phone and I can write inspiration in the moment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy this journal but I wish it wasn't a subscription. I don't wanna have to pay every year to keep my memories. Also it makes me feel like the company can tap into my account and read or share my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's only a 7 days trial. 👎"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I ENJOYED APP FREE TRIAL, SO MUCH SO THAT I PAID THE HIGHEST MEMBERSHIP PRICE FOR MY PREMIUM MEMBERSHIP. I IMMEDIATELY REGRET THIS. I FEEL I'VE BEEN SCAMMED!! PLEASE HELP!! i think it was $29.99 for my ""LIFETIME PREMIUM"" membership. It won't let me use Any features!! When i go to settings, it gives options to buy all lesser memberships and says PURCHASED in bold on mine. below it says ""restore purchase"", yet when i click it, nothing happens. all add-ons say error! help! thank you!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the idea. am not sold that these journaling efforts will remaim. permanent as with pen an books. Am also frustrated that the voice-to-text feature doesnt appear to be available. I do like the occassional pop ups, looking back at old entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So its August 15th right now I canceled my membership as of today. a message was prompted stating it would be canceled on August 16th at the end of the billing cycle. (which is the end of the free trail) please provide some clarity as to if it is actually canceled on time (which it should be seeing how it is August 15th right now) or if I'm going to end up charged which would be utterly insane."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helps me express myself daily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for archiving life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too pushy to pay for Premium. Its annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very nice app. it also stores data online so you can access it anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"peraonal haha"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but imo it really needs 'favourite places'. The thing is that I want to save my exact location in each entry. Autodetection makes mistakes, manual selection is very slow, so it could be much easier and faster to create a list of locations (maybe even with custom names) and at the entry creation screen just to select my location. That way there's also no need neither in GPS, nor in Internet connection, which saves battery. Will you consider this feature? UPD: Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't often write reviews but this one is truly stellar. Very intuitive and actually geared toward a journaling experience, a role that most notes/memo apps don't fill"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's been 3 days I'm using this app. So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best dedicated journal I've used so far with a very user friendly and aesthetic interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself is great. But, the insistent reminders to get premium parts is annoying. Every time you log in and every time you write up your diary. Why? Once should be enough. I'm not senile yet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy this app it allows for an easy journalling experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used to like the Throwback feature. But now it's going back 30 and 31 days. I don't like that at all. I might turn off that notification because of it. Take off that short time span or let us choose how far to go back. Thanks! This is very easy to use and edit. Import pics or take them and your time and location are updated if you wish. It's secure too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i requested refund within 24 hours. but no response telling me if its succesful or not. just known theres another cheaper option after i bought the membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Misleading. The app is NOT FREE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It doesn't have many free features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm not a good journal person, this app is so perfect for me to document our travels and now our new beautiful grandbaby! love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm using this app for almost 3 years but now it's time to move on. in previous feedback I suggested that you should give custom font support as Urdu needs custom fonts but after update it's not even possible to write Urdu as writing direction has been changed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was hesitant to pay for the membership, but I like this app a lot. I use it for a Mood Chart and being able to tag entries and see what tags lead to what moods has been very helpful. I also use the microphone a lot to record visualizations from the DBT workbook, listen to them, and journal about it. I ALSO use it as a foodlog and attach photos of my food over the day to the entries. Overall, the app is well-designed and clean. I've recommended it to all my friends."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"sux cuz it's a 7 day trial. they require a credit card."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"im getting tired of the advertisements and upsells, but a solid cross device option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"free until you get into the app. Then all of the sudden you have to pay to do anything but basic journaling. the prompts and all that comes with a payment. 😬 Just so everyone is aware before they waste the time downloading it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Decent enough apps to do all basic notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I actually really like the coach which has 8 different programs you works through like: learning how to journal, gratitude journal, weakly actions, etc. But I think it's a quite over priced considering you don't get any color options & only 6 font options. Yes you get B/I/U & you can indent, add bullets, numbers, or check list. For some reason there's temp on here. Do not get the trial & forget to cancel within the time frame! These guys do not do refunds PERIOD NO EXCEPTIONS!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use . expensive to upgrade ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wants to access my Google acct & when I denied, the app pretty much just stopped. Am uninstalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Do not install this app, I repeat DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! Google's Editor's Choice used to mean something, now it just seems they sell their badge to any developer who pays for it. Awful customer service, fraudulent company. Save yourself the drama, there are better honest options out there. You've been warned!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice, simple journal. I like using it to look back at my days. I really like the throwback fearure you get with membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and the design is cute..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"hmm well this app is abit shite to be honest. I purchased the lifetime premium which doesn't actually unlock the ""membership"" and its asking me for more money to unlock everything even though I paid for premium! seems people are having a similar issue. So read reviews before installing. premium is not premium and apparently buying premium doesn't make you a ""member"" I dont know how to cancel my purchase of this rubbish. so I feel like I have been conned. I think I'll stick to pen and paper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this journal app. it is pretty easy to figure out & use. I love the fact that you can save pictures to your journal entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app especially because it lets you do video recording so I can keep track of my tho7ghtghts 💚💚💚💚 #soxluv"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app needs to have pen support. I have a pixelbook and a note phone i want to just write using the pen with. other than that the app is grrat but could be better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The problem I face alot with this app is around security. Many time I will open the app, and it doesn't ask for passcode or fingerprint. It may open to my last entry. Especially if its one of my recent apps. The only thing to do is kill it completely from memory, and then open. i also have played with the timout options, but that doesn't seem to help. Otherwise 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app please don't take away the geolocation I love that too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I am pretty sure I bought a membership, but everytime you open this app there is a sale going on and they want you to buy it before it ends. This is hardly a sale if it happens so frequently. It is so annoying and ruins the experience of using Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!! Really helped with mindfulness and daily reflection. The basic version is perfect and does exactly what i need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm done with the all advertising and upselling. Jumping ship."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"sooo goood"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"My complaint is I signed up for 7 days free to try the app and despite sending multiple emails to cancel (per their cancellation policy ) 2 days after my trial began, they still charged me and have yet to respond to my request. I recommend you do not try the free trial if you are on the fence about using the app because you will get charged."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i have a lifetime sub. i like it, but the updates have made it a bit harder to navigate. but im old.so take it for what its worth."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very well structured app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been my frequent companion. the hability to record pphotos and locations helps improve the experience When I revisit what I wrote."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this simple and useful journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm a long time diaro user and want to use text formatting in my entries. Have been trying this app for few days, it's way better than Diaro. Only things I miss 1} Highlighting of search term in the search results which was always there in Diaro and so convenient 2} Ability to reorder the images in an entry I mailed the developers who replied that these are not available. I hope this can be added sometime in future. Would buy the premium purchase if search highlighting can be added."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using Journey for 2 years. I normally lose interest but this app I still use. I have switch phones twice since, and the transition was seamless. Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm enjoying the fact that writing in Journey iseasier for me than hauling out my paper journal. I'm not enjoying the obtrusiveness ofthe constant nagging to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A really nice and useful app. Great way to keep organized, record events, dates etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It does everything i want it to. The lifetime access is a great deal. I was able to exchange phones, and easily log into my existing account with all my journal logs. I enjoy seeing the logs from the past and I'm sure I'll enjoy seeing them when I'm really old to help remember all the great memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love to use it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how I can record how I am feeling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"awsome app for daily dairy writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellnt app somedays I have nothing to say but Journey lets me put up the memes and pictures that get me through the day. with my favorite sayings and the pictures speak volumes when my words can't"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"glad I read the reviews first."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app very much ad free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app is pretty amazing the layout for some reason is so relaxing and makes it so easy to write entries. I use it on both my pc and phone. I want to give 5 stars but I cant until some features from other apps are added like having uo to 20 photos and allowing gif image(s) to be in the mix of regular photos and being able to post multiple gifs. Also a huge problem for Android is trying to post memos, the posts dont accept the default voice recorder file type which is .m4a!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A really good journaling app it has a decent set of features built into it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would be better with statistics graph from ALL time used, not mere 1 year max. Also could add detail to stats graph: not mere entries per month, but per day or second, AND by words or letters per time unit!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A beautiful and exceptionally well designed and executed journaling app. It's truly everything I need and want in a journaling app. Pie in the sky would be some sort of personal timeline feature with photo and text highlights."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek design and perfect UX. I like the horizontal post switching that other similar apps does not provide."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Error B0501"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app is wonderful. being able to have a place to just let my thoughts and feelings go from the day is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"the position of tag is so stupid，i have to switch my hand to get it, can you just change it back?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, it totally meets my needs. The prompts helps remind me to journal daily and keep good account of my life's journey. I love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A really good journal app. I'm not one for writing, but it's really convenient to speak into my phone and have it right down my thoughts. I love the motivational coach as well. It really helps you jumpstart your thoughts and feelings or emotions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this app does the expected job. I don't like Goggle being involved use my datas in there, ktherwise, pretty good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I live the app, but I'm trying to figure out how to cancel the free trial before it charges me the $30. I would like to purchase the premium but I'm afraid it'll charge me the $30 plus the price for the premium. how does that work???"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"if you're looking for an app that does guided journaling or prompts you gradually in the direction of making life changes, this is not the app you're looking for. while there may be daily prompts as an option to inspire some writing, I have not found them to be meaningful or well thought out prompts. after a couple weeks of use I realized there are other places I can write my thoughts and store some memories for cheaper or free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is arguably, the best app for writing your Diary!! EDIT - I hate myself for updating it so late... But now, with the latest update, This is UNarguably, the best app for writing your diary/journal, your thoughts, and basically, for writing your whole heart out!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Misleading in app purchases and some of the worst customer service you'll find anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing!!! been using for two years and I'm totally in love with it :)!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am a purchased user of this app but disappointed due to no text high light facility with desired color text... please add this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it doesn't work, I can't even open it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for journaling. good reminders and notifications and ways to track mood and activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish when I opened my journal entries, the pictures were right there with the text. (EDIT: Pictures are now there! I love this app so much!!! Still waiting for 5 stars until it supports handwriting) Overall though, I really love how quick it is to open the app and get to Journaling. I love the simplicity there. It has a really nice modern aesthetic too. BEST JOURNALING APP. I never pay for apps, but this one is worth it for its ease of use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. It actually works as described ... which is rather refreshing. Using it on Verizon LG G7."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app well enough for text - and it is a journaling app so that's fair, but it's support for multimedia content is fairly weak. You can add photos and small videos as attachments but you cannot embed them which feels like a big shortcoming in today's multimedia driven world."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A perfect way to jouneral and keep safe from nosey roseys! Also to look back on my thoughts and or see my train of thought in thr past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good as a personal diary, I would pay outright, but not a subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Always adding features, I like it! As a feature request: on the Media tab it would be great if the photos had the date overlay and maybe even the title. With just all the pictures displayed it just looks my phone picture gallery with no organisation. That would really put this app over the top for me! Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Why was google map place picker removed? It was one of my favorite features and now it's one hell of a pain in the ass to locate where I had been in at the end of the day. Will it back? UPDATE: Developers answered and they removed the feature since Google charged a hefty price for the feature. Still gonna miss it tho"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is reminding me how much I enjoy journaling. It helps me to think things through and respond appropriately to those around me. It is good for the soul."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this. Does exactly what i need it to do. I suffer from depression and anxiety and this is fantastic for getting thoughts out of my head. It's easy to access across all my devices and private for when i need it to be. Can not recommend this enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for quite awhile now as a great way to vent and all out journal in a tottally secure way. Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy UI and helpful w. O adv"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am really enjoying this app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Won't respond to me, told me to email them numerous times and I have but they just keep ignoring me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I honestly love how you guys completely change your stories around in some of the reviews replied back. I also love how you want to tack on a charge for lifetime members for them to use the coaching part of your app. Then I also seen first you said the android and iOS systems are different and need to repurchase but in a different review saying buy one membership to use this on all platforms. You guys are completely all over the place"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm able put all my thoughts down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this ❤️ App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app is good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love functionality! easy to use but beyond useful, seriously!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"JOURNEY CRASHES ONCE THE SEARCH BOTTON IS CLICKED MI CC9 MIUI 10."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am finding this app a really helpful way to record my thoughts every day. I have also found the sharing option helpful, as I can keep a diary while on holiday and let my family know what I am up to. Keeping a diary is also a useful way to improve my writing skills. I haven't used any other diary apps, but this one seems to fulfill all my needs so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After reading Marie Nuchols review, I promptly uninstalled the app!Just by the reply to Marie's review from the customer services, it's like they're saying'Its your own fault, should of remembered'...so we will take your money.A whole years worth of premium subscription! That would of took a significant chunk out of my finances if happened to myself. So have some EMPATHY...we all forget occasionally to cancel subscriptions.To take a yrs premium Subscription off the lady, come on! Brutal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey for about a year now, didn't really use it much for some months then came back to it and with the addition of a lot of new features that I'm still testing out it is a really handy app for journaling your 'Journey'. Recommend that you give it a go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free, false advertisements. sucks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fabolous"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its an awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"where do i see the word count though?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yippee!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app, want to attach more than 4 photo."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"However it happened, I feel tricked in to purchasing the lifetime version as I thought ""all advanced features"" were included. They are not. Cant create log by email, no app access, I'll leave it up to them to explaing everything else you don't get with the lifetime subscription. Cool app for what its worth. 2 star review stands because of what I stated above."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"On my journey to more happiness, I decided to start journaling. This has been a helpful quick tool that is helping me become more aware of myself. There are ""courses"" I can't remember all of them but they give you daily prompts to consider and write about. It works perfectly with my meditation. I truly love this app so far. Happy journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I will not pay cash money for this app or allow them to have access to all my information"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Finally! What I've been looking for!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"was really impressed with how easy it was go get started.. but adding location to an entry is a premium option? lol. won't even consider trying the free version now. uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a great app, and i love that it is backed up by the cloud."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its a really convenient free journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite diary 💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love, love this app and depend on it. Twice in the last year I had to replace my phone, but thanks to the cloud backup my life story was not lost. Phew! I also use the browser version when necessary. And I so appreciate the new features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's very easy to wright and no unnecessary things was there gud one// After update with current version there is problems in Tamil fonts, letters and sentences updated automatically even I disable the auto update in my key board it's annoying while writing. fix it soon..... I'll change my rating. making more annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great Journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Upon making a refund request within the allowable time frame I was told: ""If you did not receive a reply, it is most likely your request has been rejected. Unfortunately, as a help desk operator I am not authorised to handle payments and refunds. I can only suggest that you fill up the refund form again and hopefully they will look over it again and re-consider.   Alternatively, you could also approach Google for a refund request.""   Scumbags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i am satisfied with this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so many ad :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app sync is broken. Editing on two devices can result in data loss. The latest edit is replacing the entry, even if it's based on already outdated version.  From the billing: ""My team has notified us about your review. Please remove the remove before we can process your refund. As mentioned by our team, the sync was design as intended.""  Ok, keep my money. Pay the money to the developers to fix the bug in ""design as intended"". They know how to - I've explained it to them.  I'm sorry I've trusted Google's editor's choice badge. There are much superior options on the market. Cheeper and so much more capable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I BELIEVE THAT WRITING IS VERY CATHARTIC AND HELPS ME TO FOCUS ON MY GOALS THAT I CHOOSE TO OBTAIN BY MYSELF. ONCE I WORK TO GET THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO HAVE AND TAKE MY VACATION CRUISE I KNOW THAT I WILL HAVE A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ACHIEVEMENT. I RECENTLY RECEIVED MY PASS PORT SO THAT I CAN TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO EUROPE AND SPAIN."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"You won't regret it this is one of the best apps I've ever found in my life!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfection!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm highly disappointed I bought the lifetime premium and changed my phones and signed in only to be told to upgrade again to access Google fit.why?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy and full featured"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant diary, can attach more photos now which is great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The Android app works fine but the mac and windows desktop app is terrible. When I write a few lines the cursor starts to appear more and more far to the right from the word I'm actually typing. I couldn't put the cursor back unless I start a new paragraph. This is a core function: writing plain text... but it fails. Please fix it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really love the app, give positive vibe! uodate: the app is beautiful and i love the remjnder feature. membership works well and i like the coach feature. i wish you can add more coach programs. but totally worth the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am loving it. I have never been good at journaling, either don't know what to write, or more often forget and then stop. This app keeps me on track, helps me with prompts so that I am now journaling most days. if I was to ask for one thing, it would be to give a full member, the ability to open more than one cosching prompt at a time. I would like to have both the prayer coach, and the relationship coach available in the 'today' section. After all I have paid full membership & lifetime premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been a wonderful app! It's simple, nice to use, yet roubst. It works just anywhere and has a very beautiful layout on my device. I managed to set reminders every day so to build my writing habits. Loving it!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm rewriting my review. the developer was nice enough to correct me and point a one time payment option. did that and am now using the app for an upcoming trip."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app won't merge with my GMail account, you get to watch a circle spin for about 10 minutes if you want to wait that long, and then some more. Failing to sync and use as is, you get welcomed with a '7 day free trial'... where is this mentioned, apart from 'in app purchases'?! No thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I just got this app and it seems really good so far. I love how I am able to add gifs, which doesn't seem to be the case with other apps. However, I find the constant ads very annoying and there seems to be way too much that is considered additional with membership. I will continue to try this app out; however, if it comes down to payment I would sooner go to the dollar store and go back to old fashioned pen and paper, especially because I have read other reviews on their customer service."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app, I didn't think I would use it but I do. It has a great interface it's easy to use. I love it. Not only that but for some reason I have never been able to use speech to text it just never comes out right it's always wrong but in this application for some reason it gets it right every single time without fail. thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Well I had purchased the onetime payment for unlimited membership. But some reason it says I am on a yearly subscription. I never agreed to a subscription. If the one time payment wasn't enough developers should let me know. But again there are some features that just seem to be false promises. Been using this app for years now and I do enjoy it. But not the little flaws and it's deceitful nature that it chooses to operate with. Honesty Goes further."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Similar experience to others with no response and not receiving a refund. I purchased the Lifetime membership and it did not include all the features?? The coach portion wanted me to pay additional on top of what I already paid. I only purchased for this feature. I immediately submitted a refund request. No response about it so I emailed customer service. A few back and forths and they said because I didn't hear back it must have been denied. What a joke!!! **in response this was not a trial**"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. Charged my card $30 without authorization from me. No notice of free trial. Will not use again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"user friendly application with simple and minimal design..I feel good after putting my thoughts in the journal. it keeps track of the time and date of each entry so you can just start a new page and start writing your thoughts right away!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I recommend it all the time to others. It has improved more and more each year with additional features. Thank you for the therapeutic benefits of journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its just my thing. Like, I wish to remember dates by events so much, and the app lets me do it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i bought the membership by mistake and they already charge me.. it is useless to have the membership it bascially dont give tou anything new i hate it... i am using the app from 4 years i hate to change 5 star review to 1 star now .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Everything is pretty much part of the upgraded package that cost charges monthly, it is really annoying. The only thing I really like is that there is the ability to add pictures, I'm sure they will probably make that a part of the upgrade package soon too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app! I appreciate and need this veey much. The only thing that bothers me is how much you have to re-enter the passcode. Every time you close out of a journal entry, the app prompts you to re-enter the passcode, even if you haven't closed the app (which gets kind of annoying tbh.) Other than that, it works fine and has no problems!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i been using this app for a while now it's been rly helpful ,it works perfect for me😋😊😚"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal Entry Log. I love how I can take photos and add location to my logs. It's great to look back on my journey in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"If you want a simple journal, this is fine. But know that if you want to try out the coaching or any of the features to help you develop good journaling habits, then beware, there is an extra subscription service. I mistakenly made a lifetime subscription and didn't realize that the coaching was not a part of it and therefore, I was refused a refund. That was completely my mistake for not throughly reading their terms. Still, I don't feel this app offers as much as other do, so I've moved on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far a good experience, like the fact that date and time are loged for every entry and has a few ways to peraonalise the screen that greets you. I was never much of one to use a diary/journal but find myself using this app more and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i bought lifetime and i am happy with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it says..use it all the time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Took my money during free trial. Refused a refund. Do not sign up to this unless you want ripped off. I cancelled within the app 2 hours after downloading it. On the day of download they charged my card £28. Its supposed to be free for 7 days! When I asked them they refused to refund and I am now raising a fraud claim with google"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app!! Just wish i could add audio/video reflections."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ihave had Extraordinary experience with this app and am still having it. It has made jounalling so easy for me. Thanks for building this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is my new favorite app. Journaling has always been very important to me (kept a handwritten one for years) and I spent a while trying different journal apps. This one is by far the best. It's easy to use, can be used across multiple devices, visually pleasing, and I love how you can tag the location and weather on each entry. I've only used this for a few weeks, but I'm really hoping this will be around for a very long time and that I can use it for years to come."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's a clean layout, not allot of ads, and i love the journal reminders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"bagus"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the app, but since I forgot the PIN, I cannot use it anymore. :/ I tried removing it and installing it again, but the problem remains - the same PIN I forgot is required. Pls help. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Why anyone would want to pay a monthly fee for a calendar app is beyond me, predatory sales tactics with their constant notifications of a discount for an overpriced app that allows to 'create entries at night' whoo hoo! Uninstalled!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Need your help. Paid P1, 600 in my country's currency, reset my phone, and now the app doesn't detect my paid subscription. Can you help me reconnect my account? Edit: your lifetime subscription is now at P512?? Can i convert my existing subscription?? Edit #2: purchased lifetime sub at P312. honestly i am not too happy but my time is precious"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Every day, multiple prompts to upgrade to pro ""on sale for limited time"" Evet, single, day. So annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm a lifetime member but when I got a new phone and signed in with the same username its asking me, more like badgering me, ti sign up."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very good but even the most basic features such as text formatting is in paid version only"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought a single month to try it out, but was charged for a single month 3.99, and then a freaking  lifetime subscription 8.99, (BOTH OF THESE CHARGES WENT THROUGH WITHIN MOMENTS OF EACH OTHER, I DID NOT SIGN UP NOR AUTHORIZE A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION) -  and then the this  month I was AGAIN charged for ANOTHER single monthly charge  3.99.   I never even USED  the app.   When can I get my refunds?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Add widget so that it can be easy to access."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I need to discipline myself to use this everyday... Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Keep up the good work! Excited to see new features as time goes on :). Could you maybe add 'exercising' as an activity?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm so disappointed for this app.. i did not purchase but every month they always deduct to my bank account.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This developer has not responded to my multiple emails. Be warned.     UPDATE 1: Nope. I've sent multiple emails as advised and still no reply.   UPDATE 2: Developer told me to remove my review before they will consider a refund. ~TAKE NOTE!~ UPDATE 3: Developer claims that the reason for refund is invalid. However, there is NO mention that the reason is invalid or whatsoever on their refund policy page.      ~DO NOT GET THIS APP~"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am journey my business development and log very infrequently, only to find out that all my logs have been deleted"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it.. ive had it for 5 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great app for Journaling, only not 5 stars due to restriction to only 10 images and no mix of video and photos even on paid plans."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"well done in design and simplicity. a useful tool for your life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There a membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was asked to recant my review that the developers found unfair if I wanted to be considered for a refund. I WILL say this. I was never charged as I was still in my 7 day free trial. I had asked how to cancel before the end of my 7 day trial. I figured it out on my own and it will be canceled before the end of the trial by Google. My review is just that, my personal experience with the app. I hope the developers take all the feed back both positive and negative and use that to improve."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Dies if you click ""Atlas"" with no locations stored. It doesn't do any type of automatic journaling, for example it doesn't automatically add your photos or places you have been. I will now try ""LifeStats"" instead as that does location at least"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very intriguing. I am doing the free trial but how do I cancel? i dont want it to charge me after the week."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how it says (optional) after stating ""describe my experience"". If you don't think you have a choice in whether or not you leave a comment, I really could care less what yoru opinion is on anything, especially about an app that is a journal. I'm not saying that I believe that is a fascits statement in disguise to appear that Google is giving me an option but really it's just a manipulative tactic to generate more comments, but I'm also not saying that it's not. I've run out of room to tell"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"idk its ok,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good media to keep track your new habits"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app does what it says it does and is an adequate journaling app. However, I'm very disappointed by the sales tactics employed by this company. After a few days, I decided that I liked the app enough to buy the ""premium"" version, only to find out afterwards that it did not have all of the features as the monthly package, and the features only applied to the app on my phone, not to the same account on the web version, where I would prefer to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There are a lot of journalling apps to choose from I chose this one because it was compatible with chromebooks. Instead of several paper journals I now use tags. Ever since I purchased the app for android. I can see the syntax when I try to access journey in my browser I hope this will soon be resolved. Because it doesnt look nice and it makes editing entries a little annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love how you can add pictures and track your mood too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great tool to have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Photo journalism is a like a premise for that story in mind. Most of all it is self realization, while describing your life's happenings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i do not wish to purchase this app the app is too expensive. and I've changed my mind I have not used your 7 day trial and I have actually deleted it from my system. stop I do not wish to have your product I cannot find a place to stop this except for here. thank you very much we're done"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"documenting My journey across the US is very easy for an older person such as myself who many times does not get the technological stuff. Thank you for making it so easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank yoy doe thus great app! I use it personally and recommend it to all my clients. I love being able to keep memories and stay accountable without posting to social media"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nice app, easy to use, easy uploading photos, recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The support system for Journal is I feel somewhat lacking. I've used this app before (around a couple of months ago) on my Chromebook and found it extremely useful. However, I recently attempted to use the app once more, downloading it via the Chrome Web Store. Unfortunately, it seems the app has been taken down. I received this information from a customer service representative from Journey themselves, were he proceeded to explain to me that I can install Journey using the Google Play app. He didn't  seem to be aware that I was asking for information regarding Chromebook and NOT Android.  Not a major issue, as there is always an alternative, I just thought, rushing to a reply without reading nor understanding the question is not ideal practice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app. UI is fantastic, cool ways to edit text. This is more of a suggestion but i would love it if when viewing recents(android) the content is blurred to add privacy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, easily accessible app for journalling or creative work. I use it for my daily success and gratitude journal. It always auto-saves, and with the premium version (affordable), one can add photos or other attachments, or create Word or other documents. I have not had any problems with it crashing or shutting down, either. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far, works flawlessly !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy way to do something I've always meant to do"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of the best apps out there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"tried to use the app for 5 minutes and tired already of rubbing my nose with countless messages saying one thing: 'you can't do anything in our app until you pay us'. no matter what i press, a window with subscription offer pops up.'wee dn't wont ppl 2 enjoi our app wee do dis onli 4 mani so plz subscribe ok'. disgusting"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really wanted to try this app out 😞 but I wont! Im so over having to enter my C.CARD info to get the ""7 day free trial"" b.s in order to check out what the app even does!! 🤦🏽 YES, I ""can cancel at anytime"" but if I don't cancel I get charged for a whole year! or whatever amount it is. As hard as I try to rememeber to cancel, I usually don't which turns into me fighting w/customer service and blah blah blah... The point is that I shouldnt have to put in my card and risk getting charged."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"updated - it is 7 days free and then it is paid. As soon as I read that I deleted. Oh, thank you. I am sorry. I will reinstall and give it a try. 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good and easy to use app at a reasonable price"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It was great, but the latest overhaul that added the WYSIWYG editing is horrible. I've had it forget what I had written when switching apps and I've even seen it just randomly close the editor and delete the entire entry. I am not impressed by bells and whistles when they sacrifice its core purpose, recording thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The free version had an inspirational quote. I purchased the app and the quotes disappeared. I thought it was a setting at first. Turns out that on top of purchasing the app, I have to pay a monthly fee to get the quotes that comes with the free version! The purchased version is just like the free calendar that came with the phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As good a diary set up as you can get. Free stuff is perfectly applicable, paid stuff are just icing on the cake."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"would like an Login that's not google, like making an account with an normal email address. While I was searching for the option for Tags, I stumbled over the idea, that it would be handy to be able to add tags with '#'. like #family #greatday #rain #whatever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, manageable, overlook is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love and appreciate this app. Recording my activities makes me feel better and like what is going on in my life is important. The only recommendation I have is that if you make an audio recording it should insert voice to text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a fun way to keep track of your vacation"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is stupid to pay for a diary so over this app going to find a free one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"excellent program, though location fluctuates for no apparent reason but still accurate to within 100m"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Boss"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great to help keep track of history. One day to publish my life. 07/23/2019 I'm still using this journal. I have it also to know what I was doing on a day last month. The flashback is cool also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It follows the K.I.S.S principal. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"suggestion: it will be good if we have pinned notification, which allow us to quickly write..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Evidently the best looking and functional journaling app on the playstore. But the absence of journal templates is a deal breaker for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"not a great start. just downloaded and it gets stuck while joining up with my Google account. then I get a 'hurry, give us money to subscribe, if you dont do it now this offer won't ever be available again' msg. not going to do that until I can try it out, and at least confirm it works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app was the Best Diary Entry app with each update you're making it bad the latest version 3.2.6.E is the worst version so far so much full of Bugs please resolve this issue 1) the entry is not saving properly 2) the back command used to save the entry, now the entry is not saving 3) at times trying to make the new entry the app hangs (a 10 - 15 Mb app hanging seriously thats too bad) I seriously loved this App please make it as it was ever before My Favourite Journey App Missing..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"almost everything i could want from a journaling app, except strong, default encryption"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"app kept closing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've really enjoyed this app. I did a test run with just the basics for about 2 weeks. It made such a difference in my life I purchased the premium package and do not regret it. Being able to adjust my font and add photos along with my mood and other things is wonderful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use app to keep track of articles on the Internet I encounter in a chronological order. Gives me a fantastic way to organize ideas and events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why would anybody pay to have a personal journey? I really don't get it. I really don't understand: do people just look to spend their money on something? There are a plenty of ways to have a journey if you want. I installed the app and then found they want to charge me. For what?!? Ridiculous!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"5 stars if I didn't have to tell it no to subscription every time I open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I paid for the lifetime premium account, and now I'm getting charged extra for using ""premium"" features. I'm also getting annoying notifications for purchasing these features. Would not recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works great. everyone should have it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life enhancing app, it is really good and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this application, the fact that it can cross all platforms and prompts me to write, with a quick write entry I can do in a text message format."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app just had an update for easy access for editing the texts in your entry (mobile and web app!). Great update!!! please continue to listen to your customers and keep striving to be better than before! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the app is really nice. just one question--is there a way to easily shift all my entries from one Gmail account to another--say, from an expiring school Gmail account to a personal one, or the like? Edit: thx, this was very helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It has helped me share my feelings with out sharing my feelings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to journal! This app in combination with the Google text to type feature really makes it easy for me to keep up with my journaling. I may have to go back and clarify some of the words after the fact, but it's a great way to get my thoughts down in the moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"as a paid member, how do I get rid of the ""cards"" (coach, Google fit etc) on the home page?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would be more friendly if there is possibility to make some archive. In the free version is no able any type of archive. Otherwise the app is perfect! Thank you for the response!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app greatly. It has displaced my hardcopy diary. It's simply sweet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Used to be great, the newer updates are taking away the apps simplicity but it's still worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"beautiful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a wonderful diary/journal entry program. I would highly recommend it. It's easy to use. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had to select at least one star. I never downloaded this app. It has debited my card, and I can now not remove my card from the play store due because of this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it daily...I like that I can attached a ton of stuff...its a great platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very usefull. it give you more privacy so you can write anything that you feel or experience without afraid anyone will read it. just you need to buy if you want to have more wallpaper,etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like the experience.. Thank you for enabling me to capture my journey.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's fixed! thank you! PLEASE FIX THIS: for the past week, the app hasn't been saving my entries even when I press the tick button. I have lost important entries this way. It happens every time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"There is dangerous bug in this app. On password screen, press back button and booom. It just unlocks without passcode. super easy to skip passcode. It is funny how it got editor's choice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it. not taking unnecessary pix. write up the pix or video straight away. nice app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nicy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it since almost a year now. It's amazing, easy and has a very clean interface. The only problem is the 'Inspiration' part of the app. Doesn't work most of the days. 😖😖 Please fix that! Otherwise , thanks a ton! EDIT: Why has the inspiration part removed? It used to be something to look forward to. I love the new update and the interface. just sad that inspiration is gone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I am very upset that I deleted the app after i decided i didnt want to use it and unsubscribed then was still billed for it. It was within the time frame of the trial and I was STILL charged!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so angry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"constantly tells me to upgrade when im on my computer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a really great journaling app I highly recommended it the lifetime premium is also really good and definitely worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"filled with adds"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it to copy texts and pictures from our children as they go through life's ups and downs. they can look back at it someday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far the app has done what it says it has. it is easy to use and easy to do your daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app with a sleek design...I use it all the time. My suggestion to new users would be to upgrade to take full advantage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works as intended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a godsend for keeping my private thoughts and writings private"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Whether you are journaling your dreams, emptying in your thoughts from the day or making plans for your future, this app is so user friendly & has great options to backup your information! With syncing options, I can use the web or whatever device is available to me. And I love that I can add tags because it makes things easy to categorize or reference! With my increased use of it, I just had to come back to upgrade 4 stars to 5 stars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so far, I love the reminders after ive taken a bunch of ne pictures it reminds me to write if ive had an eventful experience, I need the reminder😂 while the memory is fresh I can write as little or as much as I have time for, add pictures, Its basically digital scrap booking! I could write a book and use this app, its literally just so awesome and versitile! also all the features. ive not been bummed out by being notified that some cool cool feature is not free👍."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I've tried other journal apps, this one best by far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Really good and has become an essential part of my daily routine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fun easy way to keep a daily life story. easy to attach photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Had to uninstall. I couldn't remember my password and unfortunately this app does not have password recovery ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app when I remember to use it. Saved logs are helpful in creating timelines."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have received an email from the company and i could not figure out because she kept asking in technical words. i believe i have informed her as much as i can but no response from her. i actually gave up to use this app on Android and using it only on my iPad. i paid it and believed this as platform independent app but it was notfor me. if you're not familiar with Android, please reconsider to purchase this app. and customer service would not satisfy you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not as inspiring as I thought it would be. Definitely expensive. I was expecting more daily targets and tips on how to deal with anxiety."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. thank you so much. I switched from iPhone to android and was worried about my journey but thankfully I got it back. such a great app to pour your heart out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So I have upgraded this splendid app to Membership on my phone but it still wants me to upgrade on my tablet! For this reason only do I give it no more than three stars UPDATE app now rewarded 5 stars for prompt reply and solution that works 🤗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love this app, it would be better if you could ads a feature to let us write reactions to the older post?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect for keeping track of all of life's journeys. I personaly use it to photograph reciepts etc and keep track of my bills, also keeps track of my piano lessons worth every penny an excellent little app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love using this app to record dreams. It feels like it can do as much or as little as I need it to. There are a lot of features I havent explored yet, but the tagging and automatic tracking of entry date and location have been really useful for me, and the throwback feature has been a fun way to revisit dreams I'd forgotten about!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been on this app for just two days and i love it. Will be using it daily. Easily the best app on my phone and will be one of the most used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The folks behind Journey keep improving the functionality and usability. Especially with the latest versions it is a joy to add writings. Well done, folks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Started using from yesterday, very easy to use, simple to search any entry, with sync, possible to see from PC or laptop also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app over a year now everything was fine، until Google started bombarding me with please buy ads at every second most annoying thing it's not even giving me time to revisit what I wrote in past that frequent it is،"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent with photo upload available"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think the best application for maintaining diary. I can update on my desktop chrome as well, making all my notes and search back easily. No issues. I hv one time paid premium version of this apo, it helps me to export my data. Also it saves data on my google drive and not on third party servers, so less fear of getting seen by others. Very good application. Sorry writing review after my 4 - 5 years of subscribing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bellissima! Dó cinque stelle! Migliorerei la versione web. La farei simile alla versione di Journey di Chrome che purtroppo non è più supportata"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"7/16/19 - started using the app again but still has limitations. The Swype keyboard is the worst at recognizing words. Why doesn't this use my default keyboard… I loved the new update where I could add 4 photos for each journal entry but when I select 4 pics and see each of them in the box, they do not save and I end up getting 4 of the same picture. Very frustrating. There should also be the ability to multi select the photos instead of having to select one at a time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I am using it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Aargh, why change tagging?!? It was perfectly fine before. Why now do I have to enter another screen?!!?? You're just imposing more clicks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: Still loving my Journey. The ""Coach"" setting rocks. Thanks! --- Oh my... I never kept a journal before. What an amazing lifeline Journey has been for me. I'm adding this on 10/12/18. Just when I thought this app couldn't get any better the devs blow me away with ongoing updates that exceed my expectations. I'm recording my journey and have been provided every tool within this app to detail that journey effectively. I LOVE this app like no other. Thank you 2app Studio for an app well done!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"mayan"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just started using the app looking forward to doing some amazing things. Love that everything is in one place to track everything that is important to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I asked for a refund a day after my free trial ran out and they would not give it to me and it's been months and still nothing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"after 7 days you have to pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Downgraded it because the format on my Chrome app on Windows is messed up and vice versa."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The perfect digital journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Simple interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you need a journal app, this ia the one!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use. compatible with all os. excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"almost immediately uninstalled. Bombarded with pop-ups to upgrade before I could even complete an entry and find out if I like the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very cool APP"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Terrific app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have to admit i was skeptical of how well this would work, but as a chronic over thinker it has been a massive help. Whenever I feel my mind going overtime i just dump my thoughts into an entry and I feel so much better! Also, being able to go over my thoughts and feelings from recent days helps me understand why I think the way I do and how to better get a grasp of it. Not too sure about the prompts, don't really work for me but that's ok, if they help someone they're worth it! Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really don't like some of the recent decisions regarding the app. The two most noteworthy ones are the fact that the texts are stored as HTML as opposed to simple Markdown in the past and the removal of the buttons to go one character left or right in the editor. Seems to me like change for change sake."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I started journaling a week ago..Journey quite handy application to help me writing down my days... I wish I can highlight the font with colors...and include photos into the body..so I can give comments on them.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for every day recording - Photos included, just makes it better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app but still has bugs to work out. specifically it doesnt always allow you to insert a video clip. b) it doesn't always allow you to synch with your computer c) it keeps asking me if i want to upgrade to the premium edition despite me already having the upgrade d) does not keep the photos in the order that you insert them in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Stay away from this app. First, it is overrated and clunky to work with. Second, more importantly, the developer is a thief and a crook. I purchased the Windows version (which has no trial version). Within a couple of hours, I realized that the app didn't suit my needs and politely asked for a refund. The developer refused. Subsequent appeals were in vain. The developer stubbornly refuses to refund the app that I will not use. Be aware that you will not see your money again if you want to try out the app and then change your mind. The developer is dishonest and greedy. Try Diarium instead. It is much better app and its developer is courteous and professional unlike this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for responsibility transfer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Diary writing was the thing i always did😁Journey allows me to view it all together💻 With the paid version on Android am able to load bigger files. But it always asks me to upgrade when on iPhone or to get the Desktop Version when on PC. 🥴I figured it should be across the board ♟️ The current frequent pop-ups for therapeutic diary keeping , in my case is totally redundant."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been a useful and practical application for gathering information and my thoughts for later refining."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"bought premium and been using this app for 2yrs now.. great app. am using it everyday.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Getting into the habit of using is the hard part. Once past that you won't want to ever quit. Now that you've added a cost to the app I'm not so sure. It was better when it was free. Lost my job so it'll be hard paying for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it but my reminders are not working! :( May 2018: reminders have stopped working again. July 2019: reminders are not working again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"pretty decent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helpful metadata, great layout, reliable, used it for several years to keep a cook log forbsmoking meat. great to add photos, location and weather data with single button presses. cloud sync was a must glad they have it, makes moving phones one less problem to solve"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The reminders only pop up when I click the app which isnt a reminder if I'm already remebering to click the app... besides that I do enjoy the features. Too many premium ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"paid the lifetime premium, but need to reinstall every a few days since restoring purchase did not work. then need to reconfigure and resync each time of reinstall."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"great .. but cant seem to purchase using google credit i have from Google opinion rewards"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It looks amazing and feels amazing as well. I love it how you can include pictures and tags. Update** It looks like they fixed the autosave issue that I had before. They fixed it in about a week! It saves your work even if you don't click the checkmark at the top. 5 stars for sure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For lovers of time n moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me rebuild my confidence. Great stuff!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Would give zero stars if i could. 1000% NOT RECOMMENDED. A WASTE OF MONEY. Contacting customer service is a joke. they do not help just go in circles so they do not have to issue a credit. Requested a credit within 15 minutes of purchase and they refused. Purchased lifetime access yet needed to purchase additional packages to do anything within app. Nothing but a notepad, and a poor one at that, with many free apps. When you try canceling they refuse. Do not waste your money. Disgraceful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"only writing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very much obliged to the team for the App. I was looking exactly for this kinda experience and i just love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect for on-the-go journals. love the password protection feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is such a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this app is very helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Whooping price of Rs. 2550 per annum for what. Writing our journal. I'll rather develop my own app for one time cost. Pathetic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great support team!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've enjoyed this app and it's backup even when I transition phones. recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for a few years. Love the interface, it's friendly to navigate, easy to add entries but lately there has been way too many prompts and in app notifications on upgrading. Every click is followed by a prompt. It's annoying to the point I have now uninstalled the app. Such a shame."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for jotting down ones daily experiences. Ample features. They must have general lifetime plan like they had for device specific ones. Cuz I dont think I'm ever gonna move to another app for this purpose. Great Job on the UI n UX. Markdown support should have stayed. Idk why y'll took it away."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The premium popups make it unusable. Every time you do anything you get two of them. No point being a free user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far this little app has done me really good. helps me with my mental issues I've been having lately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just went in the app and all my photos and journal entries were gone! I should've been ""grandfathered"" in as I've used the app for free for over a year! Whoever is in charge of this app: I lost a lot of photos! I'm angry at you and what you did was very mean!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Está sempre pronta para mais uma anotação ou pensamento. está cada vez melhor."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A relevant and easy to use online journal a very nice app to record memories or notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sorry for being rude in the last review. I really ashamed by myself. Here i am, just using the app without paying any money, and i say bad thing to your team's work that was built with huge amounts of effort. Iam really sorry. I do love this app. Thanks for taking your time reading this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Had a bad experience with their customer service. They have the online version called journey.cloud. This requires a separate subscription. So all of the premium features you pay for in the app don't translate over to the online journal anymore. I went back and forth with their customer service for days via email. They lost all of my entries after the major update. So a years worth of entries are gone. They were unable to find them (and yes they were backed up). Not worth the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Be careful when considering a membership or buying a ""lifetime"" license. The two forms are confusing and misleading. In spite of its name, the ""lifetime"" license is *not* equivalent to a membership for life. The ""lifetime"" license unlocks some features, but not *all* features. You might end up needing to *also* purchasing the monthly membership if you want features like coaching. This information is not at all clear upfront."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have had used Samsung Note app and Evernote but beleive me this app tend me keeping back into it..Very useful and intuitive app with alot of utilitarian options"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you have to pay 30 bucks a months for this. what a joke. (after developer response)- redownloaded cause I was told it was free. I did make a mistake, its 30 bucks a year, not a month. you get a 7 day free trial but that's it. still being lied to my face so I don't appreciate that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hi...great app but the new version crashes on my Pixel 2."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Please stop automatically converting Markdown to Richtext. Tons of our markdown posts are lost! The new update makes the User Interface and User Experience terrible! I have reviewed this app before the update to v3 as more than excellent. But after the update, it becomes unsusable! You may need to replace your design team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Was happy to see if synced seemlessly with what i've got on my mobile phone so I can write with a keyboard on my chromebook or use the swipe to type on my phone if i'm out in the world."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this app is good and all but I'm getting kind of annoyed that it keeps on asking you to buy the premium version. it's a pest"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"an amazing app.. it's just like writing a diary full of memories & life experiences.. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, record our holidays, trips and just any moments we want to really remember and keep safe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday. I visit the app several times daily. I'm in love with it. It's my best partner. I even gave it a name- Alex."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. It has helped me keeping a consisting habit of journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"i love the older fre version. you can upload your works for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the interface of the app and its simplicity. It beckons you to keep journaling. Having bought the lifetime subscription though, I just wish there was an option to add multiple journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far my favorite journal app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic app that is improving all the time. The new look icons at the bottom of the screen are cute but take up too much space. They are better being more refined and minimal. Even on a larger smartphone they absorb too much soace. You could add value buy allowing sound files to be saved directly from the phone using the share facility, rather than having to record through the Journey App. You need to make it a secure encrypted platform. I use this all the time. It's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app. Well designed app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App is unusable after the last update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, appreciate every bit of it. Especially this new feature that helps us get into the habit of journaling. And the throwback feature! Most people, even if they journal, usually skip looking back on past entries, which is one of the points of journaling. This absolutely helps! Thumbs up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a fantastic app, I love to use it. It's very nicely finished, it's thoughtful and the settings are configurable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it's a free 7 day trial followed by a $40/yr subscription. They don't mention that till youbare logged in with your google account and they have all your information. The lack of upfront transparency just makes me want to delete it immediately. Didnt even bother to check it out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it mostly, but I HATE that there is no way to stop the app from auto-adding the temperature, and whether I am stationary or not. I can only control whether the location is auto-added. I have to manually remove all these random items from each post, and I would much rather be able to turn them off entirely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"What the heck are the last few updates for? Since you made V3 announcement you haven't explained why we need to update the last, what, 3 or 4 times. I'm a tech guy and like to understand why it is that I'm updating something, is it for improving performance, updating AD SERVERS, adding a new feature? We're trusting you with or secrets and inner most thoughts, you could at least give us some explanation. Thank you for the explanation. 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"My honest opinion?  I think this is one of the BEST apps I've seen.  I like it.  ""Why did i only give it two stars?"" you might be asking?  I made a mistake after the trial and paid for the annual subscription and I wanted the lifetime subscription  I'm trying to get this rectified but I feel like I'm being ignored.  It's a shame because this is something I would get my wife, my friends, my colleagues to look at because I think its so good.  However if they can't fix the billing issue, I will cancel and find another tool. If it's fixed, i'll change my review.  UPDATE JULY 9th So the developer got back to me indicating that my request to refund my account was REJECTED.  I simply wanted to switch to the lifetime subscription.  I missed the cutoff by less than a day and I get penalized.  The reason in the email is ""All purchases are made final when charged."".   I get it.  They are in a business and need to feed the family, pay bills, etc.  But if they switched my subscription, i would have been a fan FOR LIFE!  It would have been very easy for me to promote this app at my workplace and potentially get even more revenue for the developer.  Their loss.  I feel sorry for them..  :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app for chain of thoughts. Beautiful UI and smooth performance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a beautiful to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very happy with this journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple but intuitive enough that's makes you want to write everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Help! My subscrition is paid for a year, but, its not working. Im suppose to be receiving ""daily"" motivating words of inspiration. I signed up for the ""inspire me"" daily coaching. Ive been a paid subscriber for over 30 days with no help with my issue. The issue being "" Ive gotten the same "" 7"" daily inspirational quotes for over ""30"" days now. They are suppose to be new every day. That is not happening for me. Yes, I have reached out and left a message on your chat page...over a week ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app! use it several times a week. I can keep a journal anywhere, no need for pen or paper. I can even write a few things while waiting to pick up kids."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It was great except for one time I had a problem attaching files from SD card. i just discovered a workaround. What I like the most is the Atlas. i like moving around so makes me see where I've been"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app though it has a lot of confusing pricing system. And i bought lifetime premium because of its syncable mechanical. The problem came today as i tried to log in from my old phone. The pass code doesn't work anymore. It kept saying ""Wrong passcode. Please try again"". I'm now frustrated and don't know what to do. Writing this review hoping that the developer would aware of this problem and help me fix this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had a problem and Jeromy and Ellen helped me quickly and effectively. I appreciated both the service and the people providing it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"started using journey years ago when it was just on the web. great transition to mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use the mic, to record your innermost thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Update: app updated & I lost 3 days of journaling. I have had this app for over 3 years. Every time there's an update I have to uninstall & reinstall. I have more than 1 Google account, as do many people. I have over 60 apps that have absolutely no issues w/me having more than 1 Google account, as they can tell which account I bought or installed the app under. This developer continues to tell me because I have more than 1 Google account that I will continue to have trouble."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"the first journal app I've tried, but if it's going to constantly bug me to upgrade every time I use it, in multiple different ways, before I even get a chance to learn how to use the free version, then it just isn't worth the trouble."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I despise the fact: That I Have to Pay!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a fantastic app. streamlined, easy to use. had my phone stolen and it was a relief to have all my notes backed up to this app. I use the free version and it's perfect. ads pop up asking you if you'd like to upgrade frequently but not inconveniently. although, I would definitely upgrade to a membership if it offered a filing system. I would love to see the incorporation of folders or some other organizing tool. for now, ""highlighting"" helps. 10/10 would recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love the widget which makes createa new journal much faster"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Positive, inspiring, adds to my daily life😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have tried for at lest 3 years of serching for a good jurnal app even had papper once b4 smart phons where invented papper ones are the worst had family member go through it then tolld me what i should wright in it and what not so i set it on fire. this app by far is best app one for me fount one that was omg cool cause u wouldent had relised it just wasnt for me i deal with lots of personal problems in life i need a place safe to rain my heavy wings is best by far got livetime member"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lưu giữ hình ảnh, gắn vị trí hình ảnh đó lên bản đồ và gắn luôn cả nhật ký của mình lên bản đồ luôn. rất thích khi một ngày nào đò xem và đọc lại chúng."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was able to restore few memories. thanks to the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So sad they want something like $50! And monthly paid subscription, and to WHAT? TO MY SUPER ULTRA PRIVATE DIARY SO YOU CAN SHARE MY DATA? heck no! Of COURSE it's ""editor aka googles"" choice it's a most private data grabber is what it is. Yuck"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"OLD EDITOR UI PLEASE!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It replaces all previous journal apps I've used. I use it multiple times a day. Easy to backup and share."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've fallen in love with this app - in no time at all. It's perfect for late-at-night note-taking. (Ten months later) Yep, still using this thing almost daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app changed my life..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have used the app for more than three years with not a single complaint but found the new version much disappointing. I'm making some of my journal entries in another language and I find editing the entries including the simple cut paste option difficult in the newer version. Only a part of some of the entries gets saved in the end wasting away my time and effort. I want to continue using this app but is there any way for me to reverse back to the earlier version? TIA"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"changing from 5 star to 3 star because of the changes in tagging. why make it harder to tag?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ok, you got me! latest updates have been amazing! only thing is that when you select the calendar in the Compose window, no matter if starting day is selected to be Monday, there is Sunday. In calendar window is ok. Would be nice to fix that! keep it up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best cellphone journaling app I've found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"PERFECTION"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I really, really love the new Text Editor, it's so much easier to use! Thanks guys!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Solid Alternative to certain journal apps, and way better than the majority---From ""Day One."" I am looking forward to seeing this app evolve and add more competitive features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is good for what it does. I have both the Android and Mac versions, and each bring a lot of convenience to the table. There's still room for improvement, such as the ability to switch between the new editor and markdown; manually edit the weather for entries that cannot automatically add that information; or have more than one location on an entry for times when we're traveling. But overall, it's a well designed app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yes indeed make me have that I have achieved my goals for today :),"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It is a good app but the are issues with the formatting. Sometimes the text formatting just changes to bold and i can't change it back. Also is difficult to do copy/paste. Please, fix the issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The latest update made adding tags to an entry a bit more circuitous; you now go to a different screen altogether which is annoying. Other than that it's still a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How do I get a refund? Very confused"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"new update doesnt save text. when i start writing. then switch to different app. then when i switch back the text that ive written dissapears. no way to salvage text so VERY annoying and basically makes the app unusable for me. please sort quickly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"double spacing issue was fixed in latest update! learned about the latest features including checkboxes. pretty cool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. does everything I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank you very much,, it was a great App fo daily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my favorite journal app! I absolutely love it and use it all the time. I've tried a lot of different journal apps and this is my faborite of them all and I won't use any other journal app. Definitely recommend 10/10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love the latest update. Cannot wait to see were this goes!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Latest update is really good but it's somehow look like copy of wordpress. I am using Journey since 2016 and I saw many changes in it but this update is really cool. Dear staff if possible please don't over complex the UI and don't run for the money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I installed the app, used it twice, and forgot about it. This is par for the course for me with my attempts at Journaling. No fault by Journey at all. However, I always disable system notifications for all but a select few apps. Today, I got a system notification from Journey saying, ""Long time no see, how have you been?"" I double checked the notification setting. Saw that the Journey app's notifications were disabled. So i uninstalled it. I will never keep an app that ignores system settings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I've been looking for a platform where you can jot something down in your journal anytime, anywhere, and Journey does it perfectly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has been awesome I have been with Journey since almost it's inception! Great app and made Journaling a habit now! Helps in so many ways! It's gotten even better over time hope they don't change too much and keep it roughly the same!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This used to be a great app for making quick journal entries that can be easily categorised, but the new ui has made tagging a chore. I used to just tap the bubble in the bottom left corner and select a tag or create a new one, but now I have to go to a separate screen, select the tag, confirm the selection, then go back to the previous screen to save the entry. Also, the new bubbles at the bottom of the screen are much more unsightly than a single solid bar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. a few issues surrounding the saving. Sometimes if it autosaves it will not save again. there needs to be a clear manual save as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best diary app I've ever used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like tags and maps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app was working great until yesterday. I try and type and it goes so slow. I can't even see what I tyoe until it loads/catches up. I have tried restarting my phone several times, my app is up to date and I go to write in the journal and it doesn't type/the letters don't appear right away. It takes a few seconds for it to appear. Will uninstalling and reinstalling delete everything in the app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the new rich text editing feature is really awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"After the update, the whole interface is extremely troublesome. With automatic changing of headings without the ability to change it back (because im not a premium user), and being unable to save so many of my notes properly. Auto save has stopped working too and it's just a bother. I'll probably stop using this app already due to how troublesome everything's become."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Never said this is a 7 day trial"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just want to know how i can access my previous entries on the phone app version. I really like you've got longitude & latitude coordinations. I just realized that i need to pay for a subscription to see it. The paid subscription is enabling me to see my diary history."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like this app but some problem when joury app note the sotry but not note"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"12mb size, good 3/7/2019"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"OUTSTANDING APP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great application. gladly paid for the premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"okay but ads on every launch???"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple, easy-to-use. Don't even know all of its capabilities yet but so far I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really dig this. Awesome you can just upload photos and it adds to the map. Just updating because of the app's recent update. Adding bold and italic options 👌 great move"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app. Everything I wanted and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for journaling and tracking feelings, important moments, and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Frequent updates and design is really good. im enjoying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journaling app. And has helped me through a lot. And I could even see the places where I wrote the entry, which brings back those memories when your looking back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good for writing your thoughts instead of telling or yelling them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Never commented on an app but I'm coming out of the woodwork for this one. I have been using the app for a year now and it's great. I thought I'd try the one week free trial for the premium. After a week, on the day I was going to cancel, I was hit with the $40 yearly subscription fee. I've emailed numerous times but no response. At this point I would be happy with a refund for even 11 months. Good app, but the creators are crooks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'd give it a 4.5, but it's the best app of it's kind that I've found for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this journal app. I've used it for 3 years now and it gets better and better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For 30 years I made it my goal to create a habit of journaling but inevitably quit after a week. The Journey APP helped me meet the goal by making it a simple one click start and a diversity of ways to construct content. Sometimes a journal post is just a picture or an audio file too. Journal leaves my options open for a personal reflective post."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Android app update has messed up the appearance of entries. The Journey website ""chat with us"" option is disabled. The Android app's support chat is online, but no one replies. I've bought the Windows, Chrome and Android apps. How can i get help?? This is not the first time i've not been able to contact Journey Help. V frustrating, esp since i use Journey every day.  Update: Found helpdesk email address, sent message. Waiting for a reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"you're the best app! I love you! When I get money I'll buy the premium because you're worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"my experience is good with the app especially with the notifications bit that compel me to write my journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They offer a ""premium"" life time membership which I bought just to realize that the major functions were still locked because apparently the normal ""monthly"" subscription is a different type of subscription and it's tiered above the premium subscription. So here I am with my ""premium lifetime subscription"" and yet many features still locked. They really should change names of the ""premium subscription "" for ""basic lifelong subscription"" So pissed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ellen was very helpful to me in chat. I am less than computer literate, and her instructions were written in clear and readable English, not in computereese alphabet soup. When I can, I will be back, in part due to her help in canceling my membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the most conducive environment for my thoughts..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a fantastic app and does what it says. the only dissappointment is the last update, where they have implemented line spacing. they should rather give line spacing as an option , so it would be as per the users choice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love love love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journal app, hands down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, easy to use, adds photos easily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"overall a good app you have to pay for some features once that you might actually want and you get a popup to get the annual subscription after your install it on your phone which is normal but once you reject the offer on that phone they stop bothering you which is great one thing unless they have it and I have yet to find it is I'd like to be added is to ensure which devices are connected to this app so I can deny access to any other devices that are not supposed to have my diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i was using the app consistantly to log my workouts only to find that today all of my journal entries lost the asterisks and are unusable and just a jumble of numbers now where it used to be sets, reps and weights. along with the malicious premium popups every time you open or enter anything recieving 1-2 requests i dont think i will continue using and will try to salvage my lost data in some way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app. It's GREAT!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wow. This app makes me to write and want to use it again and again. It worth every single cent and praise as well. What a lovely app and developers make it better with every update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for more than two years! The longest app i ever used (except in-app from my phone). Really love it. I hope i can use many fonts in every journal i wrote. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have just started my Journaling with this app. It has a good UI. The two things I miss: Title option and edit tags. Hope you take this as a suggestion and implement it soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love keeping a journal of our journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A bit pushy to subscribe, but otherwise great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"minimalistic and incredible!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only 'free' for 7 days, then subscription. 😐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple. elegant. beautiful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of my favorite apps out now...so glad i found it.... don't know what i did before..o i know papar and ✏️ lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"trying using this app to help with my mental health issues and getting thoughts out of my head , working so far very friendly UI"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have really come to love Journey. I love seamlessly going from the web version to the app on my phone. I like the ""throwbacks"" I get when it reminds me of things I wrote the previous year. And it gives me a place to write about photos I've taken. It is all private. I don't like sharing everything. I just like keeping memories for myself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and with good features. I'll give a five star if editing features are improved... highlighting, bold, itallic, etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love sharing my journey with Journey. Fun, with amazing features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app has my life in it and its really good to read things after some time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly app. It helped me to find writer in myself to relax and express myself, I enjoy reeding my previous experiences and can see how my attitudes change over time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having the ability to put my moods and reflections down on paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that i have a place i can write my thoughts out anywhere i go. it has a passcode and it has lot of extras"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is very easy for someone who is new/ terrible at journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I generally enjoy the app and upgraded to the lifetime membership to unlock options to format text but whenever I try to format the text it changes to a link or surrounds the text with asterisks. There also aren't many options for customisation of text, for example, I think highlighting would be a useful addition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was a long time dailyo user I bought the full version but after trying your app it has a lot of features and possibilities I fell in love with it ♥ I bought the premium lifetime once and for all I just want to know if there's any possibility to import my entries on the other app or I just wasted two years on it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Your aggressive methods of advertising is putting me off this app. 2 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"iv had this app for years. changed phones and forgot about it and when i downloaded it again everything was still there. its so good you can put attachments on entries too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been able to keep track of my journal on my phone when I don't have in actual journal on me, handy! Being able to my review has been convent as well trough all my life changes has been great too. This app has been refreshing and life changing as I have gotten older. Thanks for being there & handy thur all of it! 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app. It makes journaling simple with easy reminders and prompts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"lots of marketing and pop ups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app. I write in it almost everyday. I would like for it to have tabs for different topics, and I'd really like if it didn't ask me how my day was when it's only 8 in the morning. I can't even answer that cause the day has barely started. It would be better if it asked me that later in the day, or if it asked me how was my yester day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it! I use it for my exercising"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great way ro keep track of important events and notes in general. I always think oh I'll remember that... nope keep a record, i liked it enough to make the lifetime purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I went to edit my journal entry and BOOM. it was gone. I was extremely disappointed as I wrote alot. there needs to be something in place to prevent entry losses. other than this experience the app works fine. I prefer more features though, such as Microsoft one note."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"la uso muchísimo y le daría 5 pero con la versión gratuita es suficiente, las diferencias son mínimas. No me parece tan práctico dar formato con mega etiquetas"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app. ,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an easy to use app that helps me journal consistently. I like the interface and the transition from different platforms."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lately, whenever I sync, it says it's syncing 100+ things even when I just added 1 new entry. What's up with that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Put simply - really dig this app 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journaling App I have found, and I tried quite a few. Easy to use. Lifetime premium option was reasonably priced. Not a company wanting to just make money. Lots of options and opportunities with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Super aggressive ads at every corner coercing me to upgrade even though I paid for the lifetime subscription through the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Did you guys take down Journey for Chrome?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"How about you make it clear from moment one that there's a yearly fee of $29.99?!? That would stop people from going thru the all the trouble of downloading your app simply to have to waste time getting to the unannounced payment page and getting pissed at the fact that you purposely shined us on in the hopes we'd just give you our cc to get out of your endless question pages. HARD PASS"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"its one of the best diary but you should add more features on basic mode"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app after a long research"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very cool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it 🖤🖤🖤🌙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent 👌👍😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app for recording your memories in private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Moved from IOS to Android, Day One didnt have and android app. This is the next best thing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my journaling. Tons of functionality and the app is very stable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"motivational"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best journaling app i found so far. inexpensive monthly membership to unlock the entire thing. the best thing about this app is its simplicity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is alright. Not overly exciting. I wish it was a little more customizable (backgrounds, colors, fonts, styles support, even stickers) . Also it would be nice to have the pictures within the journal and not as a separate entity so that you could place some throughout the text. Other than that I have no complaints. Works as designed and as promised."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using the app for more than 3 years now and have been very happy with it. However, I recently moved to a One Plus 7 Pro which runs Android 9 and the app keeps crashing. I cant use the search feature anymore or enable a fingerprint lock."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I can write about my day & post pictures. Also the premium version is at a reasonable cost. If you are a journal writer, I would HIGHLY reccomend this app. I have used this now for a few years now, so I am not writing this as a new user.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app, so good to keep track of everyday moment's and its great for keeping a good mood!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I tried many apps regarding same concept, and this one is best...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app... it's beatiful and helps me a lot to keep a diary about my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loving it so far, wish audio was free tho"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Was really looking forward to using this...BUT it says it is useable on my computer.  I cannot figure out how.  When I go to install it, it doesn't give my laptop as an option...just my android phone.  It may be user error, but I can't figure it out.  Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This not just app it my diary , supurb app,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is useful for recording private thoughts regarding the days events. You can include pictures which is nice. A long term bonus is I get reminders of what I wrote last year or 2 years ago. this is great fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Altogether a great app, although i somehow lost a couple of entries after switching phones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"exceptional app. very good interface. thanks to team journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use, excellent tool to help create a journaling habbit and record of life. Love that I can include pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to Use, Fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. May I request a ""on this day"" function? I know that I can just click on the calendar to find it, but it would be nice to have a list of that day in the past years line up together. Updated review: I found the ""throwback"" function! That is what I want. Thank you very much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Kept spamming with ""speacial"" membership deals. Annoying pop-ups showed up at least 5 times when journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ive tried so many diary/journal/notes apps. but i always back to Jouney. this is the best! i love the UI/UX. simple and warm. i love the illustrator. i love the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes it so easy to make quick entries and to review them later. I really like the addition of the tags and emotions too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just found out I was charged $45.99 for subscription. The thing is that I didn't want to suscribe if I have to pay that much money. I was using the app on trial and I thought I would be given a notice when the trial period ends. However, I wasn't given any notice and charged $45.99 for subscription automatically. I might have misunderstood the terms and conditions but I do feel that I was cheated. I hope other people don't fall for this unfair scam."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I moved to this journaling app from Writeday (another wonderjul journal app, definitely try it out), and I'm not disappointed. the lifetime premium version I'd definitely worth getting if you intend on jotting down your daily adventures. this app vould use a more diverse array of widgets tjough. I'd like to see an 'day entry preview' widget. fearures like that definitely encourages more journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used the app for 4 yrs now.It's dope."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and simple. Love."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does everything I want it to do and is easy to use love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app a lot and I especially like the password feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. it doesnt matter where I am. Im always assured that my electronic journal is just a tap away. My thoughts, my notes, are kept safely. and I can share if thats my desire. Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's a great app and can be so useful if you do a regular entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"impprted all my notes from Day One to Journey. perfect app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app; complete to it's purpose and exceeds in usefulness to each individual's need upon application. Highly recommended as a powerful tool to refine great amany skills."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love being able to make quick entries throughout the day and it automatically adds the date and time AND I can add pictures!! Just wish I could add more than 4 but still loving it so far!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After trying all Journaling apps I landed on this one as this does everything I want and in more simpler way. I got lifetime premium and I am happy I did that. I been using for 3months or so constantly and it works fine and I love interacting with it. A teeny tiny nitpick I found atleast for me is the wallpapers for me the custom wallpaper setting stopped working whatever picture I choose it's not uploading or working. I mean it's not end of the world but it gives more personalised feeling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome! Just what I've been searching for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep all your thoughts. Simple to use. I like that I can use it both in Desktop and the app, as other apps do not give you that option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"useful app for schedules, lists, and reminders! has a calender that you can easily find old pages or reminders for future events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant journal app. Smooth, flowing and easy to express your thoughts anyway you desire. Hope to see how one year of journaling will look like on it when i get the flashbacks. Nice job guys."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The dumbest app ever.. A place to write notes(journal) and put pics. And pay to do it. Tons of other apps do this. Create a private Facebook page.. Jeez"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, only thing is Google fit doesn't work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really good application , as i thought day by day , if you miss a day , you can write later for that day , insert picture , search option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"gud app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Doesn't give me credit for premium. purchased lifetime. premium but when i try to use coaching it wants to sign me up monthly. So now I basically can't use the app. Bummer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect journaling app for me! Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I forgot my password, how i can change that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"impossible to cancel"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Meets everything I want in a Journal! Love being able to look back on prior entries and search either by photo, date, or place! The backup was also a huge sell for me! I do wish it was possible though to have more pictures per entry sometimes and even be able to combine pictures, video and voice recordings per entry. I would love it even more if it could backup to my evernote account. That would be all I want to see it as a five star app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Looking for a good journal to keep tips on how I painted miniatures, this has promise, but inability to name your entries other than the date is a HUGE drawback, and the tagging sysis a jole, cannot use a space or even a dash."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This tries to trick you into a monthly payment from the start. Be very careful with this or your journey will be unpleasant."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Generally a good journal app. Frustrating that after paying for the premium version I still see ads every time I open it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very please with this application and I use it for everyday life events. Just I bought a membership long ago but yet it doesn't give me the option to record. Can you check, please? Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"WORST SERVICE EVER. I bought the membership and than a few hours later i realized its not working well and I don't want to keep it. I asked for a refund and this is what they replied back to me every time 5 days in a row, ""Our customer support officer is away. Please note that our customer support is available from Monday to Friday 9am to 5.30pm (UTC 8+) or 8pm to 4.30am (EST). We will get back to you on the next working day."" Complete BS! at least have the decency to answer your customers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for years, it's the only way that I've been able to keep any kind of journal. It continues to improve, and when I do have troubles & concerns, help is quickly available"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"convenient to be able to have the option to voice the text chat and then to have it online should something happen to your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This isn't a free app. Only 7 day trial. But they asked u for permission into your account first... be warned !! i removed this app in less then 3 minutes!!! I've tried to skip as suggested by developer. Reinstalled and still the app asked for $. Now totally not going to trust them. Remember to remove their access on your mail account because they had asked for access to your mail and Google drive!!! If it's really free then STOP ASKING for $. If you are asking for $ it IS NOT FREE. 2nd chance!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Decided to use this app as I am about to embark on the holiday of a lifetime! My honeymoon! We were married on the 1st of June, and we are about to cruise on the Queen Mary 2 to New York, sailing back on the QM2 as well. We have booked our accommodation on the highest possible, on both directions and thought that this would be a super way to diarise the whole event. Thus far I have added as much information as I have been told, the rest being surprises, and I will remember it via ' Journey' ,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love the simplicity and the lay out"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"the app works well enough. my negative review is aimed at the customer service. I was charged for two memberships and when i reached out about this i got no response. Actually to be fair I got one response. After finding the receipts for both charges and sending in reply to the confirmation of my request, I was asked what the receipts were in reference to. When I explained the situation (again) there was no response or acknowledgement, or direction on how to proceed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the free version and it is all I need. I like the ability to be able to search for things with key words."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this application. This app has improved my writing skill. most important if any one who is searching about a journal or private Diary. Then this app must be the best option. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"there is no way to mass update or delete old tags. Is there?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly whimsical log!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"why do all nice things require subscription? I would prefer to pay once and have it for life.....I really hate these things. no all can afford to pay monthly for an app edit response: sure, if you wish to lose customers then yeah, make it payable. because I want to pay for an app I will barely use....smart...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love journaling so this app was right up my alley. 5 stars for all the great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, nice to look at, no annoying ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of thr most vital tools anyone in leadership should be using each and every day. We as leaders must be diligent collecting vital information and or observations as they occour and store in/on a credible platform, Journey is the pick of the bunch without a doubt. I love the features especially the date, time, location and weather stamping of each entry. so much better than hand writing in diary or sending self an email record. improvements would be in PC layout and format options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's easy to run and easy to use. I enjoy the convenience and privacy features it offers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using since two weeks, best app for diary writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous journal, habit forming!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Request: add a recycling bin or undo delete feature. Great journal/diary app. One criticism I do have is that it is too easy to accidentally delete an entry. If you click the edit button it is immediately replaced by a trash can button to instantly delete the entry with no confirmation message. I have accidentally deleted one entry I just made so aside from the annoyance of having to write it again it wasn't too much of a nuisance. However if it was an older entry I'd have been very annoyed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Only gave it 4 starts as I have purchased the lifetime membership but still got billed £28 for basic membership for daily inspiration. So if you purchased life time membership pay once last life time you don't get all the extras that are in normal membership that's billed yearly so to get everything you still have to pay the £28 a year regardless if you purchased the lifetime membership. Which I'm not happy about and don't understand why this is. Apart from that I love the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Probably the best journaling app I've used. I've downloaded and tried maybe 15 different ones. Wish there were more features for moods and activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Review for Lifetime Premium only: This app is great. I have no complaints. No disruptive, intrusive ads and it does exactly what i request of it. You can make all sorts of journal entries using voice, images, locations (if you're interested in this sort of thing). You can also set the mood you were in at the time of writing in the journal; happy, sad, indifferent, etc. You can obtain stats and see your own patterns and maybe discover new things about how you yourself operate. Worth the download."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is the most pointless app ever. I wouldn't even bother downloading it. It took a yearly subscription after me using for 7 days, what happened to monthly subscriptions. Personally any app that uses this approach to charge customers a yearly subscription rather than a monthly subscription is having to resort to these cheap tactics because the app isn't good enough. I've been told repeatedly to remove this review if I want to be even considered to get a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for journaling. I like the idea of having an electronic copy of my journal at my fingertips. Easy to use and I like the reminders too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app! It is easy to navigate, to add entries and set up reminders for journalling. I have used it every day for the past year! The only - well, there's two of them- thing I'd like to change is the number of videos/photos and adding both at the same time. Second thing is that I think it somewhat too much to pay for a desktop version if I have already paid for phone one - it would be nice if both were available when paid :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a perfect App. Helps me keep a journal across all my devices!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it so far definitely love the fact I can sync with Google drive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A well-designed app I enjoy using. However, can you turn down the advertising just a little bit. I understand it's necessary but just tone it down a notch. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to vent! Really good locking security which takes off the worry of someone going through the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the free trial and while I had the free trial I decided it was not for me. I went to try to uninstall and take my payment out of it so  I would not have it and have to pay for it but was unsuccessful. I put in a request ASAP through the chat feature and was patiently waiting on a reply. It said it would let me know.....it never did. I just went on there to make sure it had cancelled my subscription and gave me my money back since I will NOT be using this and had decided I didn't want the app. I then found out that I COULD NOT get a refund back. ...so that is why I am giving such a low rating because they will not give me a refund, even after explaining my circumstances.  I will definitely not be suggesting this to anyone.  Now I am stuck with a subscription for a year that I DO NOT WANT and WILL NOT USE!!! I just want my money back!!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I looked for a decent journal for SO long. This have EVERYTHING I need. reminders, alarms, calender...saves into my Google account, so i have years of entries i dont lose. Thank you so much! Im so impressed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"would be perfect if their wasnt a monthly fee.... deleting , no point in doing the free trial. I would pay a fee but definitely not monthly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good and stable app for taking daily notes. Goid user interface, elegant design. Liked this one after evaluating a lot of diary apps. After using tge free version for few months, finally went on to purchase it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ill give it. 5 stars but the. Membership is expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good interface, easy to interact, NO widows desktop version, to be fair actually there is one but is basically useless. If you want a full Windows version, you have to download it from Microsoft, and pay about $30 per year extra. Three stars because of this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Seems like a quality app, but please give users a chances to even see what the app _does_ before spamming ""special limited offers"" for premium subscriptions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app! it is so easy to record my daily journal entry and add a few photos to represent the day. I also like that I can keep track of my mood and the temperature of the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Does not seem to synch well. Even after refresh. Makes one wonder if it will lose data in cyberspace."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I use it all the time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to keep a photo diary of your trips and important occasions, b4 u forget the special moments in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it, really! Like, this app is great. Oh, 4 stars aye? Oh yeah, theres a little problem, of course. There are so much kinda useless stuff you need to buy..smh..But, it was the only diary that was alright. Can you fix this? there is wzy to many stuff that could be a tad but helpful, but its so small! Srsly, just make everything pretty almost free, and you got five stars, alright?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has everything you want for free. and if you want more then premium is the way to go. definitely planning for a premium one time buy thing. 5 stars from me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"How can I get back my premium subscription? Just factory reset my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app mostly to try out the Coaches feature. I paid for the lifetime premium as it stated it unlocked ""all advanced features."" It did NOT unlock the Coaches feature so I contacted the developers requesting a refund within minutes of the purchase. It has now been 2 weeks and I have not received any response about my refund request. It does NOT list the coach feature on either the Lifetime Premium or Membership purchase page. Apparently they don't respond to refund requests."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple to use, quick to record little moments, clean display"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"just a 7 day trial.not interested"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love that i can add photos with entries. also love that I can edit the date if I want to write something down that happened a day or two ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great to keep log"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far easy to use. fair amount of ads but hey it's ""free"" so you are the commodity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works really well. updates are easy and its good for cross platforms. Simple but effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've been requesting a REFUND for weeks with NO REPLY! Your marketing & advertising is extremely misleading!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The Premium version is awesome but it would be great id wd could add custom moods and adding a title to our entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please add list item support 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was using a 7 day free-trial. During this time options for purchase kept coming up and I liked the app enough to buy the Android only 1-time purchase. you would assume those adds were tied to my trial right? No. after the rest of my 7 day trial was over the app charged me over $30 for a year's membership to the purchase option I had opted out of....and no no one will respond to me, no way to get a hold of anyone. and they never have an agent available in their chat option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"free app means free no money im not paying for nothing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"there's a bug on the latest update. i can see the notes preview in the list but when i try to view one, the whole note is empty. the photos are still there but not the text. I can just view the note using the edit page. please fix"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Buy this. 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice and perfect application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please make me add more pics and vids"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this to be one of the better apps to record one's chain of thoughts. The additional tools that supplement each entry, such as weather, emotions, etc. all act to ensure that one has better recollection of the circumstances surrounding an event. Highly recommend, even the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"just wish i was better at making entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very simple app for journalling. Been using it for almost a year now.. very happy with it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Awful. i had a queston and got a chat message and was told there would be no customer service staff until about 8 hours later, 5:00 pm Pacific Time. That's a non-starter. Now I'm being inundated with welcome emails but no help cancelling my membership as i repeatedly requested. Finally got a message saying to cancel via the app store. But I cant see a way to do that. Aargh, wish I'd never seen this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this because it's simple & it automatically records time, date, location, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"this is easily a 4 star app, except that I bought the lifetime membership and it constantly nags for another subscription. i don't even think it offers anything above what i already paid for. enough is enough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful simple journal app. does the job. thank you!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super app…  already own the Jotterpad.  This one completes the package."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great app! I bought the lifetime membership because this is the first app I've found with writing prompts & I was very sad when I discovered they are only offered in the monthly membership... I could buy a journal with writing prompts in it for the same price I paid for the lifetime membership, why would anyone pay $4 a month to have prompts. that's basically buying a whole new journal a month- unnecessary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful. beautiful and amazing. can see my growth in consciousness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had bought the lifetime membership a while ago but uninstalled it. recently, I reinstalled the app and forgot that I had the lifetime membership and bought the monthly membership. not obvious how to cancel the monthly membership so cancelled the direct debit. update... I've now cancelled my monthly membership but not sure if my lifetime membership has been cancelled too. I'll have to wait and see"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it for my daily prayers and just to be able to reflect. Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it is a really good app with nice name, logo, design, interface, features everything is really nice. Only issue is its privacy is a bit flawed. if I uninstall and reinstall the app, it gives an option to sign in with a google account without entering the password and at that time the applock passcode is also not enabled so basically anyone can look into my journal. If only this issue was sorted, this will be my journal app forever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"convenient. secured."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excelent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really an enjoying this app. lifetime member"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"helpful :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Couldn't sign in"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoying this diary. Easy to use with great features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"very disappointed. whenever I want to try to set something up or add something that tells me I have to have membership or it wants to charge me a fee - I already paid $6 for a premium lifetime subscription, and customer service is awful three separate messages and got me nowhere $6 down the drain - uninstalling app I will look for something that's not so deceptive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the convenience of journaling right on my phone. The only reason I gave four instead of 5 stars is they got rid of the daily quote/inspiration. I paid for the premium membership, but I still have to pay extra to try one of the prompt options? *sad trombone*"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. 10/10."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ดีงาม ตัวapp ดีถึงแม้ จะใช้แบบฟรี"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"tried many different app and this is the one i consistently comes back to and sticking with it now. love the throwback features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! It makes something that I love doing super convenient. It's hard to find time to sit down with a book and pen with 4 kids running around. Journey makes it easy and fun! I also love that I can add pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i paid £8.50 purchase for lifetime access to my journey notes that i collected over many months. now its telling me i have to make a payment again. tbh id rather go ahead and use notes on my phone and back it up somewhere rather than keeping on having to pay for access to my own notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, can share places and lots of things to log them in the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"dope"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great app however I have problem with the coach feature, on my android phone the coach function appears fine when I go to the 'Today' section, but it doesnt come up on my macbook at all... which is a shame because I want to write the prompts on my laptop !! any idea on how to solve this issue ? I downloaded the app because of the coaching feature ! Also would be great to add a to do list feature ! it would make this app really complete !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A must when traveling. Easy access to notes and photos. Easy to use. just what you need when you need it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the reason I really like this app is because it syncs with chrome app version on my laptop. Sadly, I found out that the chrome app version is not included in the mobile app pro upgrade when I made the purchase. Is there any difference in features or other things?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"needs multiple journal support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i just wanted a simple journal where i could make entries and add tags to them. this does the job for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptionally good application to record your daily activities. Recommended for all who likes to write diary and wants to keep it safe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"very malicious software has a tendency of popping up on the down low I finally narrowed it down to this app uninstalled very intrusive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, pleasing design"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Beautiful interface and very user friendly. Made me start liking journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent. I would love to see link attachments i.e YouTube or article pages. also longer audio attachments to 1h+ in more audio formats like m4a"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really cool app. I downloaded this a couple years ago and wrote only a few entries and wasn't really keeping up with it, so I decided to delete it, thinking it was pointless as I have a paper journal. I downloaded this app again the other day not recognising it. I signed in with Facebook and my old pictures and memories were on here saved and it was exciting to look back on priceless memories and milestones. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"not much options to manage hand drawing and way to insert pictures between text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I think it's a great app to write down some of your day, and privately keep your journal on the go. I am kind of bummed at the limited number of pictures, or types of video you can say but I dont mind. Also, it feels sometimes not as secure as it says it it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be nice to be able to add more mood types with much better graphics. The ability to jot quickly with my stylus directly in the app instead of typing would also be great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Intrusive pop-over notifications, despite having notifications turned off. Support told me it's a ""feature"" that users are responding positively to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i have been using the free version for about a year then early this morning before I was even awake the app went from free version to paid membership without my authorization and charged my Verizon account. Shady"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so cool diary.feel happy to write in it.has cloud back up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic diary. it have restore option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"no longer has a smooth start. asks for passcode/fingerprint repeatedly! also the overall experience is no longer as it used to be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for me! It's nice and simple to write in and add pics and stuff! But there's a heck of a lot more to discover if you want to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm really loving this app. Wish I could have had it my whole life. I've never really kept a jounal before because of getting bored quickly. However I love being able to add my photos. 🤗🤗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you have to pay for all the features. tgerevis no way i can use it for free!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful! Please add archive option in the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only thing I would change is that I would like to be able to attach mutliple things to an entry. For example, be able to attach a voice recording and a photo too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app to type down your thoughts to review later"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I signed up for the 7-day free trial. I was then offered 50% off the annual price and I accepted. 7 days later I was the full annual price in addition to the 14.99 I already paid. I emailed CS and got no response besides the automated email saying Journey recv'd my complaint. When I view my Google subscriptions it shows 2 paid subscriptions for this app. At this point I feel scammed. I want a refund🤬. Avoid this app like the plague!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Great app, but incredibly misleading premium options.  I purchased the lifetime premium, but found out that there are features missing from the lifetime premium that you have to get the monthly membership for... how does that make any sense?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app I've seen. Somehow they make it no/low pressure. It's inviting. It helps that I'm gathering data about myself, but that's not my only motivation anymore. I love it; keep up the great work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful and loaded with so many features! It's way more than just a journal. If given permission, it will track where youve been during each entry and map it; it will remind to do an entry and/or to record your mood. The mood is on a 5-scale happy face chart. I have depression and anxiety, so 5 options doesnt cut it and I use a different app for that feature. But add in the photo journal chalenges, the throwbacks, and the tie in to google fit makes the app worthy of the 5 stars I havr given"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great experience with everything backed up on my goggle drive as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Now, i have problem about location, it can not show when i push pick up location."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Better in theory than in practice... I keep trying though. I really do want to love this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app I write to my 2 year old all the time so when he grows up he can read what I was thinking"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I missed the deadline to cancel my trial and was charged for a year. I messaged multiple times for a refund and never got a reply."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App keeps crashing again and again"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think there's room for improvement. The features available on desktop should be available on mobile, and vice versa. For instance, the daily journal coach and more colors/themes should be on desktop. And the saved templates on desktop should be available on mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Would have loved to be able to insert more than one picture per entry, but otherwise a great and easy to use diary app. Update: changing to five stars now that the app let me put in more than one image at the time anf some other great updates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Best and only journaling app I've used. which in my book means a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"New to using a journal but more inclined to using a digital version than paper. So far I do like the app especially since I have a poor memory of when I started or completed tasks or goals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"they had an update where they said they reduced the amount of pop-ups to get you to upgrade - but i still get 2 as soon as i open the app & another once i finish an entry. journey seems to think they can harrass me into upgrading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"please add feature to track habits as well. other than that, this is a decent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app, simple to use. Helps me get thoughts in order."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A nice app until greed takes over their business model. I've been a long time PREMIUM user of Journey. I can overlook when they feel this wasn't enough and added in a subscription model. But when they starts to have pop up offer in a paid app, offer that apparently ""I cannot refuse"" with 50% off subscription...Well I refused and now using Dairo that I paid once and has similar or better features, feature that Journey deemed worthy only if you pay them on a monthly basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use.. And very nice app... Thumbs up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I installed the app and discover that it is free only for 7 days! And that the membership is automatic after that time??? Really terrible! do not install unless you are prepared to pay!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"أعجبني التطبيق وزاد حماسي لتدوين ذكرياتي وتوثيقها بالصور والفيديو"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wished the text is larger for tablet/chromebooks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"🖒🖒🖒"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love Love Love this App!!! This is my most import app that I have put on every phone & computer that I've had for the last 5 years. It's one of the 1st apps that I paid for for the full version & has consistently delivered what it says it will do. I can make note of what is going on in my life while I'm sitting in my car waiting to pick up my kids and/or at the end of the day as I'm getting ready for bed. Then I can look back at what was going on in my life last month or 4 years ago if I want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"top app. multi platform. new features added occasionally."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been comparing note/ journaling apps for a few days now. This one is winning, for having the features I need which I need to make a list if and then update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please make the syncing faster.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent journal to have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and fun to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good Journal app! Would be great if it had the option to have different journal notebooks. But, otherwise... well built and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"locked out, unable to reset passwords. hate to put time and energy into something to have it disappear, should have an option to reset the password so I don't lose all my entries. waste of time otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent, simple tool for recording thoughts as they occur. And searchable so I can find again, maybe a long time later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i loved this application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excelent !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Liked it and bought the Lifetime Premium upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nice app, but extremely malicious advertising practices. One day it cites me a fire sale at 1250 INR for annual membership discounted 37% from 2000 INR. After the supposed ""fire sale"" is over the price is 577 INR for a lifetime membership. 🤦🏼‍♂️ There's also a constant ""Let's Upgrade"" bar on the bottom of the app which males it annoying to use. Sell the upgrade on its own merits, dont constantly throw it in my face."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for my daily diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Overall experience good. Font size is kept as extra large but still font is small. While viewing ""calender"", all the entries should be available on the interface, instead of clicking on the date..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Advertised as free but it's only a 7 day trial and then you have to pay a recurring fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice interface, great that you can add pics. little annoying that phone app and desktop priced separately, even though they sync well. should be some way of stopping the promos to upgrade"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wish it was actually free access"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling app. I've used several ones and this is the best one so far. Can you guys please make it possible to flip screen on phones? It flips on tablet but not on phones Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very user-friendly, which is important to a non-techie like me. It's easy to use and I would highly recommend it for recording things that you want to remember."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far one of the best journaling apps I have used. I had jumped off another app, which was not living up to its reputation. Discontent, I went searching for something better, and I found it in Journey. I haven't looked back since. I am so thankful to the team who brought this app to life. It has allowed me to detail my time here onto ""paper"", so as to look back upon my good and not so good days. I can now peer back upon my ""Journey"" in life, to find contentment or lessons learned thus far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I contacted the customer service team a few times about reimbursement and never got the answer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Very clean, fast app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using it for a week as a lifetime premium user, and so far, my experience with Journey has been nothing short of delightful. It's encouraging me to commit a journal entry daily and I hope my review would spur you towards keeping an entry too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling helps keep your life organised. A good tool like Journey make it easy. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been hard for me to keep writing a journal, but this app makes it 
easier. I can add picts, location, weather, even my mood for that day. 
Awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that it meets my need for attachments, keeping track of stats, allowing me to reenter to embellish and most of all go back in time to make corrections and make changes to locations. Sometimes I go back to tighten the story lines of my journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"luv it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"changing throwback fanctionality from yearly to monthly is annoy!!!!! please add an option to decide how throback should work for me!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great journal app. Easy to use and reinstall make keeping up regular entries easy. Keep up the improvements - would be nice if the analytics worked over all time not just month by month and Throwback isn't particularly helpful. Otherwise good tough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! One of my favorite apps!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a very nice easy journal to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"2 years and still loving it. Edit- 3 years. Thanks for making such a wonderful app. 🙂 Edit - 5 years, and not a single complaint i have of you guys. Keep them features coming! 😄"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"sweet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for year it's the best I love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. I am in love with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is easy to use and lovely to look at. What surprises me most is that, even though the font is very small, it's also perfectly readable. So you can write quite a long entry, but still read the whole thing without having to scroll up and down. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect diary app for me. Easy to use and back up, plus photos, location, temperature, and mood tracker are all nice additions. An excellent, slick app. Bought the full version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A very good app to jot down thoughts throughout the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Truly cross-platform. Clean interface. Just too bad that the Google fit integration keeps telling me that there is no Google Fit session available ... Would deserve 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"haha"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it has been a really good Journey of writing my feelings. it has helped me grow emotionally."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"new review for this app, had it several years now and still like it. Paid for the original premium version which was a one off payment, the only thing i dont like about the current version is when it tries to get me to pay again...im quite happy with what i have now and dont want the other features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app to describe my vacation travels."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very helpful, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing man"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really amazing, well done team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good way to get things off your mind"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the most amazing app I've ever come across, I write each and every detail of my day in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"portable, secure journaling. keep it simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great way to keep track of progress toward a goal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It is my favorite journal app but i have a problem with the landscape mode or the fact that it does not have a landscape mode. This is the reason for the 3 stars. I want to be able to write on my tablet with a normal keyboard but is hard to do so in portret. I wrote an email but i got no answer. Pleas enable a landscape mode for the tablet users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal app I have seen so far on the market. I hope they get adding new functions to it. I especially like the night mode."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"When I was looking for digital journal, I found this one. and it is great. it has everything that one need. Android app and web version do for me. But 2 points holds me to buy this product till now. 1. insertion of photo on my desired location or as inline not as attachment. I love to insert my photo in between my writing. 2. gallery view is limited. when i try to insert a file from gallery, i need to browse long if the file is old. its annoying. Regards, Suman"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love using this app to journal!! I don't really like that I have to use a Google account to register though; for privacy purposes on their end. Still I love the app and will continue using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it. i got the premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I purchased the Lifetime Premium and really enjoy this app. It is easy to make an entry via web or from the app itself. It is a good way to keep track of my thoughts over time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice to have one place to record my thoughts as I go as opposed to numerous notebooks here and there. It has been very useful to me. I've come a long way from where I started when I began to use this app. Love it in every way. Soon I will be upgrading."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"hay i am your premium member and i am not happey with that.. please add calender feature in your webfree service.. and second most important thing just open a feature by which i can add one audio and atleast one picture in one journal..... i hope you consider it.........thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"worse thing i need to purchase premium ship for particular platform.... and webfree interface in really bad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"it costs?! I am sad.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very good app, would like some additional features like templates maybe integration with habitbull and others, but it working great for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it to record daily medical activities. Other than the ads, the free version works great for that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"overall I like it. bought the paid version and use it to keep almost daily entries. I like being able to add pictures and locations. have used it for a little over two years now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have been using this app for a long time now it has all ways been free too use with some limitations. an excellent app of the highest standard. i would recommend it to any one it is that good. but with the last up days it looks as if you now have to buy and paid a monthly subscription fee. living on a pension i can not afford this. so to be on the safe side i have uninstall the app as i ha e no money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"does what I need it to do, hold my secrets!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple easy to use and has nice features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This was my first paid journalling app. I have been using everyday (365 journalling + pictures). Beautiful app. Works flawlessly in the cloud. Password protected. And beautiful layout to go back and look at previous entries. Highly recommended. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Happy until now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great and simple app. good luck"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Good App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"True, the App is one of its kind. Best app for journaling I could ever find."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app. However, giving it a 3 star because the app's content is visible in the recent apps. It should be blurred out when this app is not the active app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb way to keep track of life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for daily journals. purchased the lifetime premium and so far I'm enjoying using it far more than other apps of this kind. only two things i think could be improved. the differences and benefits between lifetime premium and monthly membership was not clear to me. also it would be great to be able to save your own template that can be used for daily recordings as many people use custom prompts to aid their journal inputs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Enjoying the app more now that i have premium and have the Windows version as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very pleased"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i downloaded this app last fall, but switched it out for another app. I'm giving Journey a try again, but there's one thing that always gets to me. The geomapping in this app is always incorrect in regard to my apartment. I can easily turn off location, but I think it's a neat idea to keep on. My question is: Is there any way to have this app set a registered location as ""home"" or ""work""? it would be a good idea..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! Between being able to use night mode to using themes and wallpapers for the app, I can't decide which part is my favorite. This app is very customizable. You can even add screenshots, photos, etc. to your journal entries. It keeps track of where you are, what the temperature is outside, the time, and what you are doing at the time of your entry. Very ingenious, dev's! Thank you for a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i use this journal application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Frustrated because I'm trying to share an entry as a post and I haven't found the magic key. Too new to evaluate, but may be great. I like the idea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying every minute of using this app. Great job guys!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple style but great for quick writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"excellent app for keeping records. wud be more useful if Landscape mode keyboard was added. its a pain sometimes to only rely on the portrait keyboard to type long entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"using it since 7 days. For transition from physical to virtual, it is an awesome application to trigger everything. perhaps, buy now window taxes our brains"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"1 of the greatest apps on Google Play"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Can't edit or remove location if it's wrong. It's making my journal inaccurate. Hence, two stars..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please add reading to activities please."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it for recording progress in my day to day life, discussions with clients, principal companies etc. Tags help locate important information."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use, beautiful interface, lots of features and really a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice Journal app, easy to use when I remember, with the odd quirk."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"handy dandy little app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does what it's expected of it excellently, superior to similar apps. No frills, just the muscle."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app. worth it to buy premium. hope the dev team continue to upgrade this and add more features. KUDOS :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply amazing. I have this installed on my Linux desktop and also my android phone. It works seamlessly across all things, including my iPad if I want it.   I wish there were more developers that did this - worked across all platforms seamlessly.  If you want an app that will work on whatever platform that you want, pick this one. Simply amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"absolutly love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and helpful for tracking several things in my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the feature where you can speak into it. It transcribes quite accurately too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app, recommend to heaps of homeschooling families as that is what i use it for 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great experience so far. Have used it on-line, tablet and phone. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Diary app ever !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app. use it a lot on a daily basis. Best journal app out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am enjoying the free version. It is user friendly and enough for wanting to start a journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm only giving 1 star only because I seen the benefits that very few people have gotten from this app. I decided not to go with this app because because it sounds like they're all about the money! and a lot of the reviews I read regarding customer service is so true even their remarks back to people has very rude overtones so I don't even know if I would be the appropriate person to call customer service and talk to a live person that might not go well for them. personally don't use it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best diary app ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. I'd have to say the best that I've used on Android, and I've tried many. I've even upgraded to the paid version. If you like Journaling, this app is for you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app.. can easily transfer to new device just sync with Google account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its so great, the app gives so.much, i have not yet bought the membership , but thinking of it, can u please put an option to see what a throwback look like,(1 throwback free for a user) so we see whether its good and click on that buy button 😋"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. I've not come across a single problem so far and everything syncs well!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"works as described. i like the flashbacks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"works for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the app but for some reason it wont let me purchase it or find out more about price? i press the button and the colour changes but nothing happens!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it very much. Truth is, I didn't explore many journaling apps prior to downloading this. But once I downloaded this, I just like it. It's clean and easy to use. I immediately bought the lifetime package for 10 bucks. Few days on, I have no complaints. Recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"очень полезное и удобное приложение"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was so disappointed after installing because of the reviews, to find that I would be charged £28 after 7 day! so not able to use the basic programme for free as described. I have therefore deleted and uninstalled the app. it's a shame because it looked to be exactly what I was wanting to make notes in."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I bought this to jott down my feelings and track my day to day experiences. Love it when I get notifications from a year ago"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"able to keep all memories. very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to store and record your memories with timeline. Two much needed features would make this an awesome app. 1) The option to export could be improved... with possibly flash/webpage like integration to allow better display of photographs and playing videos. 2) Playback feature to play the same like a slideshow/movie. I hope the developers bring about this much needed update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app... Need I say more😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It surpasses my standards. great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Accessible. Says it all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The constant request to rate this app five stars is SUPER annoying when I had already rated it five stars. I paid for the app and provided a great rating, please stop begging for feedback. I also STILL have upgrade requests being thrown at me, again, despite paying for premium. Please stop!! Every other aspect of this app is amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's everything I need all in one place this has to be the best journal app by far, would definitely recommend this product to friends and family!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LOVE this app and have shared it with others. I started using it to journal my cancer diagnosis and have been able to see just how far I've come! I love the one- and two-year throwbacks! It really puts your 'Journey' in perspective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"to get full use need to pay. no clear guides to what memvership does what. was going to add the gratitude add on but woukd cost £30 a year but yhen offered lifetime membership for £9. god knows!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Totally great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE, USELESS APPLICATION. HORRIBLE, USELESS CUSTOMER SERVICE. I LOST ALL MY JOURNALS because they were NOT SAVED TO THE CLOUD AS ADVERTISED!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"3.5 stars. the premium is only good on android. If u want it on windows u have to pay $18 (-0.5*). My biggest problem is that I can't add pics from journey.cloud (-1*)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A Mind Palace of its own in the technological aspect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I went ahead and paid for the premium version. if I had to choose one app that works. This is that app. This app doesn't give me any problems, it just does what it's supposed to do, no error message, no muss no fuss. One nagging ad is my only complaint, hardly worth mentioning."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app. i am a paper and pen person. cause all the feelings that i felt especially in tough times i always write it on paper. but now no need it . because i can write it down here . i used this as my diary . digital diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Whenever I change phones, I lose the last year's journals! Journals are not (always) uploading to the cloud."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like the idea of knowing what I worked at in the past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"says it is a free app, but it is a 7 day trial and they dont tell you that until after you give them your info and set up the app. they say it is easy to cancel but there is no apparent way to cancel in settings, or in help. there are multiple places and ways to upgrade to more costly versions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is wonderful... I enjoy being able to note down daily activities, everything is so easy to use. well done developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good and convenient journal app for recording daily activities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very handy app to keep a diary. I use it regularly especially on trips because I can upload photos also. I can go back to any date and update. If any short coming the posted photos can not be rotated,a small issue, but may be can be corrected."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love the total experience with journey i am used almost 3 years one of the longest app on my phones"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It might take you a second to understand the dynamics of this app. But once you do, it will be the best app you've ever purchased."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfect for everything from writing down notes and journal entries to allowing me a place to quickly. write down and track my blood sugar numbers. Love this journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"new updates have made the purchase worthwhile. the only app I found that timestamps my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Ads of getting lifetime premium is annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic features..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! Just works!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"on the way an interesting way to keep track of vacations that I take."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super impressed with the initial hand holding screens to teach you how to use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love the app overall- except for one major flaw. If the app isnt fully closed when it's not being used, the diary does not lock, so if someone looked through my phone then, they would be able to read everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app used to write in hard times and happiest times as well thanks to the developer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I looooveddd it. It looks great, and it takes you through your journey just like the name. Would recommend for anyone else interested in keeping a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it's free and simple to use. does the job"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it. have used it for 4 years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app I've used. Streamlined and suprisingly useful features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"its just a seven day trial then chargeable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app so far! easy to start an entry and do tags so I can go back and read about what I wrote about specifically. Havent tried the other features like photos yet because I dont take that many but it looks user friendly too!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"just started like the timestamp and location for each entry. not using the locatio feature but see uses for it in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good App. I can add important events, with photo. All can be seen at a glance. Great App, and it's free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"use daily. it's my lifeline."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life changing. The app makes it so easy to stay on top of Journaling - a must have for anyone looking to bring more reflection, gratitude, and healing in their life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My only wish is, in the future pictures and videos can be attached together in one entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like this app as its like having social media but without the negativity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy and useful. Daily reminders of joyous moments in life all journaled in this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I just downloaded it 5 min ago and I was so excited to start, until I got to the last step and they already let me see what I don't have if I don't pay. I am so sick of ads and every app sucks unless you pay. I was really looking forward to this too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is definitely a must have for those looking to find themselves. Unlike the media, it is a platform designed to showcase your good moments, your moments, and above all else the truth within yourself. I highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awsm"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"some functionality has been missing but overall I love this app... using it from almost 3 years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm a life time member, is there a reason why I can't see my inspiration anymore and im being asked to subscribe when I try to choose a journal prompt program?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"decent app, but holy cow the pop up ads for buying premium are the most obnoxious I've ever seen on an app. i can understand once a week but every time i open the app? terrible business model. would not recommend, solely based on this decision to annoy customers. edit, based on company's response: i can understand developers put a lot of work into making the app. it was a bad *business decision* to throw annoying pop ups in the face of a customer evaluating the app every time opening it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not a 1 because I have to pay. Why should I I have to pay to write down all my personal feelings like seriously."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! But i want it on my laptop too!  But why do i have to pay for this to be put on my laptop when I already have Lifetime Premium?  I would like an answer from the developers please! Thanking you with gratitude"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app very easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a really fantastic app. I like the flexible choices of paid upgrades, and the amount of value you get from those upgrades. It's definitely centered around having a great interface for writing. There's bells and whistles like prompting questions, throwbacks, and the atlas, but the developer has definitely maintained the main focus where it should be: writing. I find myself using it for all sorts of writing tasks, not just journaling, per se. Adding metadata to entries is easy, too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Aggressively pushes a purchase, including notifications. They somehow made their ""buy me"" notification keep coming up even after I blocked their notifications in the OS. - They responded to my review complaining about aggressive upselling by, upselling me? Incredible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only a few days in but I'm really enjoying trying out journaling so far. Journey makes ut really convenient to record my thoughts whenever I want so I'm less likely to forget to add things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wonder will I still be able to use journey even without play store? I'm a huawei user. So kinda worried about it because I've been using this application for years now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Went through some really tough times and I read somewhere that journaling would help. This app will handle all of your journaling needs and comes with a lot of features to help you with that. If you want to test out journaling as a hobby the free version will tide you through but this is one of those apps I'd ask you to consider paying fully for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excelente y muy versatil, puedes ordenar las entradas por tag, agregar archivos fotos, muy fácil de usar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a shame how intrusive this app has become. I did use the daily reminder but now there's some ridiculous mood measure pop up, which appears to be tied to the reminder (cannot turn off separately). Deleting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very good and simple App. could have included formatting options in the app. Now we can use only markdown language for formatting. i purchased premium and its cheap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far so good..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"not bad app, wish it were less expensive to have on pc also"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I haven't used it in a while and when i got it again it was significantly better than it used to be. I really enjoy being able to make multiple entries for one day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm quite happy with this Diary/Journal. Well written and maintained overall, it's simple enough to use and has helpful features such as a search function and a dark mode (with the premium version). I really like that it performs backups to google drive and as such, my entries aren't at risk of being lost if my phone is broken or misplaced. I took a star off for the simple reason that the app still shows me advertisements to upgrade to the premium edition when I have already paid for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Comfortable to use. Clutter-free. I like how you can back date an entry via a photo..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Finally a place where I can collect all my little ""cutouts"" and notes! I would like for it to include a calender, task/habit tracker, so that I could have everything in one app and attach comments/pictures to the event. It's more of a personal wish, rather than a flaw. All in all, it is an awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app if only it had a one time payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I thoroughly enjoy the app. its easy to use, you can attach photos etc to it. it automatically saves where you are at the time of writing. I've never had a single problem with it and have been using it for almost a year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORKS BEHIND THIS APP. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app. but some function on pro version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and accessable. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! instead of posting to Facebook, or in addition to posting to Facebook, I post to Journey. It's so easy to put my thoughts down with pictures. I also use talk to text so that it goes so much faster. I wish this was available when my kids were little, so I could dictate the cute things they said. now I dictate what the grandkids say. It's great and easy!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I paid for lifetime premium on android, but in the same username on IOS doesnt work. Do I need to pay twice on both android & ios? I dont think so. please fix it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wanted to check whether one can write with S Pen in Samsung tab instead of typing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great journal app. worth the full version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing UI."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Makes keeping a journal so easy and convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"ডা‌য়ে‌রি হিসেব‌ে জা‌র্নি'র অন‌েকগু‌লো দারুন ফ‌িচার রয়‌েছে।"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love this app for journaling! The reminders i set help me to practice consistency and routine. I'm able to chart fluctuations in my emotions thru the month and compare month to month watching for patterns and triggers, consequences associated with my choices based on emotions. very good tool for insight and self awareness. would give 5stars if publishing or posting entries for public criticism and suggestions or just public opinion and comments would be a great FREE option instead if buying it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that you can store pictures in your journal and have forever access when you upgrade to premium. It's so easy to use. Highly recommend this app for journaling. Also offers reminders for adding entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love how easy it is to use and that i can get to it from my phobe and my computer. i use it to jot down memories of my kids"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simplicity makes its good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm not able to sign into my account in different phone. I want to get my data back after reinstalling this app. but couldn't sign in and couldn't sync. what to do?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice to have this app and to diarist my life with logotype and locations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great cross platform journal I've been using for years. My only complaint is syncing between devices is too slow."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app... nice features. But videos recorded on my phone on journey app don't appear on journey cloud on my pc!!!! Why is that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying this. Very happy with the cloud sync too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"stopped using it because of aggressive spamming of premium version..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"just starting this app.. I will update my post soon"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You need to say it's not free from the beginning, not after people go through all the setting up process and create passwords!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i take it back .. i absolutely love your applications and all that they do for me and you and them. i feel like your connecting us all on such a profound level i cant help myself but fall victim to its charm. thank you for being u and for keeping everyone in tune with their emotions. u are appreciated more than u know. much love and understanding."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the app and the features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Extremely Disappointed. Lost all of my entries when I changed phones!! Do not trust this app. I am not stupid and I had Internet backup of my phone memory. No obvious option for saving this to the memory chip SD card. To bad for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journaling app with sub. has all the bells and whistles from tags, to a calendar view, to full markdown support, even dark support on desktop AND mobile. if i use a journal, i use journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good product"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nice clean journal app. i love the widget to go strait to the entry page. i like that i can journal anytime of the day, multiple times, and its automatically dated and timed. I like that you dont need to upgrade to use the app. its still aesthetically clean and completely usable. you basically gain customization and statistics with the upgrade. also the reminder. I took a star off because lifetime upgrade said id unlock all features, but i still have to pay for the coach stuff if i want it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"enjoying very much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"decent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is an excellent app. I specially love the memories. because I've been using this app for two years now, maybe more, I have a lot of memories saved in this app. it makes me regret that I didn't write more. i would've had a memory everyday :) sometimes, it's not a good memory, but even at those times, you keep reading with a smile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"deceptive billing practices. AVOID"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"paid lifetime premium to avoid membership fee after confirming through chat with Journey that if paying lifetime premium you wouldnt have to pay membership fee. then was still charge for year membership fee next day. put in request for refund with journey, explained I paid both within one week and requested 29.99 refund as I was told through chat with company I only had to pay the lifetime premium. 4/23 8.99 charge 4/24 29.99 charge...no response in almost month now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best apps :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"dont like how fragmented the premium features are... I bought lifetime premium, only to find out theres an additional subscription fee to access few other features the ""lifetime premium"" option doesn't offer!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Locked with password is such a good thing to use. I felt more secure about writing here than on online blog. And i feel like i can say everything i want. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'm a lifetime premium user, why am suddenly seeing ads after switching phone?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best app I have ever downloaded. I don't utilize a few things on the app just because I'm not interested but the functions I do use are wonderful and I appreciate this app for its simplicity and it's necessity in my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this journal app is the greatest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it really helps to have a digital diary in my phone so I can type out an entry when I need to...instead of needing to carry a journal with me everywhere so i can write in it. I dont use my journals daily so paper ones aren't as practical for me whereas this app is 100%.l -- strongly recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is by far my most favourite journaling app. I find it simple and easy to use. It has everything I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app, good for journaling. My problem is solved already, I succesfully changed my google account associated to Journey, and my lifetime license is safe, thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey helps me keep my personal life in check and I am able to go back and revisit to get affirmations and positive thoughts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its great the app i dont like that it constantly asks me if i want to upgrade when ive paid for lifetiome premium and its not perfect in the sense id love the left of the interface to show categories or tags and i can click and scroll through the list. i know it has this functionality but i like the ability to have them show up as left side headings the left side feels over simplified and i like complex. but im quite happy and those are only nice to haves not need to haves"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant. Polished and a delight to use. Even has a windows version making it easy to keep up the journaling habit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple and atractive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app itself may be fine, but naming something Lifetime Premium and aggressively pushing it to user at the first launch is, you know, doubtful tactics if that 'Premium' doesn't unlock app's best parts (one have to subscribe to monthly anyway). Make it $99 and give it premial feel, or just rename it to 'Extended pack' or something. Also, guys ignored my email regarding a refund - I later found out from the doc on the site that I was not eligible, but ignoring a customer, cmon?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a journalling app I've been using for over 2 years. It's simple, beautiful and intuitive. It gives you all the features you need to record your journey in this life without being intrusive and forcing the medium in which you do so. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try for anyone looking for a good journalling app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app! so easy to jot down precious moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you want a journal, this works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best friend yet unreplaceable!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a decent app my only complaint is not having the ability to make the font bigger."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"even though i really like it, i don't know why, there is that weird limit that i can only put one tyoe of media per one per entry. Would be cool if you could put multiple medias(ex. photos and a voice recording) together at least as a premium or something."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good journal. I t would be better if I could save it to a chip."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Used this app back in 2016 and stopped shortly after. Returned to using this app for journaling and it's been the most wonderful app so far that allows me to journal daily or even enter entries that can be from another date/day. Even without having to subscribe to the membership, the basic functions are sufficient and hope the app stays this way and improves."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal app. I love the features and the ease of use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's really a great way to keep track of all your activities"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i'm enjoying the app very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"On my Samsung tab I can't access onedrive. When I try to add files the screen goes black and nothing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"like having a journal on my phone. works great for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best app for keeping a daily journal..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A nice journal app. I like it, and I love the fact that it synchronises to my desktop too. The daily prompts are helping me to start a habit. My only criticism is that I've had to tap ""never"" three times for it to stop nagging me to rate it and I'm not entirely sure it's stopped yet. I guess time will tell!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really liking this app. It's easy to work with and being able to have a secure place to write out my thoughts and keep a diary of events is great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a grate app for keeping a diary and a eye on your moods ect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always wanted to write diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great app, although would greatly benefit from: - ability to add collaborators - ability to share your complete journey online"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would be 5 stars if the app allowed to write in an immersive interface - no buttons, in-line tagging with #, no distractions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes me cry while writing it y'know why?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works like how I wanted it to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice little app to have handy for when the need to write arises...nicely organized!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use. best thus far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"the premium notification pops us every time, that's really frustrating. otherwise seems a nice app to take care of your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"just perfect for what i need. a daily journal or should i call it diary 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Says it's FREE. It is NOT!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Actually work with all devices!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"journey ऐप्प पर अपनी डायरी लिखना बहुत ही शानदार अनुभव है।"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful way to record travel. It's like having a giant map on the wall and placing pins everywhere you've been (only you can add photos and notes too!)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this App, love the fact that it gets saved up in the cloud and i can always have access to it. I love the name too because i see my life as a ""journey""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I opened it up and got interested in the features but quickly got turned off by the pay offer and an offer for a free trial with a sign in option. Deleted it without checking the rest of the program."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite app for all things personal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i love this app until I forgot my password. and now have no way of getting ahold of Nyone to hep me retrive it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, exactly what I was looking for, I'm a tattoo artist and it's great for organizing my appointments I can also add a pic of the tattoo the clients is looking to get."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"cant afford!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I forgot passcode. how do I reset? the screen is set on passcode entry and no reset option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"just to much emphasis on premium. money isn't what to dole out to do this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app though!!!! bravo!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if you think even aloud this is the app for you.. i write books with it , you can too !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that this backs up online so that I can use this on any device. so easy to write in my bedroom and attach pictures making it more interesting. it is very easy to use, and I like the new update where it shows past memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"enjoying the heck out of this app. barely scratching the surface.j"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"l love having this journal that is free and easy to uses. You can add to past days as well. Can also attach pictures. So far I am loving it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journel app i have I used, and I've used them all. really good, clean, to the point, Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. If there is an add-on, it would efficient if there is a rotate function within the App when uploading pics. This is minor nuisance though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I SEARCHED FOR AN APP TO START DREAM JOURNALING & THIS IS THE APP THAT POPPED UP 1ST! I JUST DOWNLOADED IT & I SEE MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. I AM EAGER TO START, BUT AMONGST ALL THE OTHER COOL FEATURES, I JUST STILL WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK THAT THIS APP IS INDEED FOR *DREAM JOURNALING* TOO??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Functional, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic app that I put down the old pen and paper for. highly recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. An excellent tool to remember what happened in in the past. I use it as a travel log."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am not able to buy the paid version. Not sure if it is Google Play itself or your app. Tapping the purchase option and nothing is happening. (update 8/5/2019) I will try that and let you know. Thank you for your prompt response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Map View can be improved to include all the places jn one pic..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used it for over a month now us it everday and if you did ever want to start journalling this is got everything you need and it keeps it simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the first app i ever paid for. and i am not complaining it. love it. recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I missed the deadline to cancel this app by a few hours. I didn't want it and requested a refund. No response so this is why I have to blast my annoyance here. My issue with this app is that it didn't meet my expectations of ease of use, what the purpose of some features were and overall not my liking. I canceled on the Google Play Store but I tried to reach out to developer with no response. I switch between using Droid and a Mac so this was another feature I wasn't too sure if they had it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app very much. I like the convenience of having g a place to put my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"beautiful app, makes me want to actually use it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First time with writing a journal. Have been using this for about 10 days and decided to subscribe to the membership which gives you cross platform functionality. I've still got to suss a lot of things out, but I really am enjoying using it. Great app! Been using Journey for a few weeks now, and would really recommend it. Ive never journalled before, but not it's bocome a habit. Excellent app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best app and journal for those who are horrible at journaling. Be ing allowed to add photos is key."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So simple to just jot down thoughts and feelings on the go. I prefer pen and paper journaling but the convenience of this app just wins me over."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very Nice..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an excellent app to track daily emotions and events. it is easy to use, I've been using it for almost 4 years, though not a consistently as i should. It has all that you need, can give you reminders and because it saves to Google, you can change phones and still have your diary. I'm curious how it's going to look as time goes on. i think it will be awesome to see."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"THEY CHARGED ME TWICE!! and their response.....DEAL WITH IT 😑😕😣 I DID fill out your refund form......Two App Studio you still have done absolutely nothing about it! NOTHING! other than ignore it. I'm over here still dealing with it 🙄"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journey has become a part of my routine now..been using it for almst an yr and would like to add that i m very much happy with my experience 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app for those who are in search for a good dairy aap."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it! great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, encourages me to express, reflect and organize my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"edit: Great app... just missing a few things. went a head and gave it 5 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I have always planned to write a diary, but it's so difficult to write one. Journey just makes writing a diary a lot easier. I didn't hesitate to purchase a premium and I am willing to pay for the membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and good apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too early to rate 5 star. Good so far. It reminds me appropriately, which has made this attempt at journaling much more successful than previous attempts. So far. Some of the reminders are ok, others are not. It seems to be all or none; I don't see any control of the reminders in the app or in preferences. I turned them all off within the o/s, though that's not really what I want. HEY, I paid for the lifetime premium version, and now you pester me a couple of times a week to buy a year's licence"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I've been using for two years now. it is easy to use, and the interface is nice. I only wished I could add photos and videos in the same journey entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is great. Simple. Easy on memory and battery. What's more needed...fantastic app. almost 3 years.. still the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"poor customer support and contact options    :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"At a lter date"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm obsessed with this app! I just had a baby and don't want to post to Instagram every single photo I have of her. So this is my outlet and one day, I'll be able to show her everything she did on each day as a baby. It also helps me teach celebrations and things that I learn. It's so great! Thank you for this! Only downside is that the free version only let's you add 4 photos per post."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. please add more features if applicable. hehe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app, it's easy to use and does the job. I purchased the cloud option and it's wonderful, as I can pick up where I left off on any device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a great journal/diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Revolutionary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"You ask me to buy premium too intrusive. And the cost is too expensive. For the program for storing notes, I spent a maximum of 2 dollars. Because of these two problems, the desire to go into the application was lost. Not nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I purchased immediately. I was looking for option of Digital diary. I tried to maintain in word, google Calendar evennote and Oneonte. But this is best one with tag and search option I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use, perfectly convenient when on the go"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if I could draw the world would be scared of it . I can sing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been a wonderful app over the past few months. It's intuitive, simple, yet robust. Works everywhere and has a very attractive layout on my phone. I have it set to give me a prompt every evening which helps keep me actively writing. It's just a pleasure to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Reminders do not work for Android Pie. Also, in the past, ""Daily Inspiration""/""Coach"" was part of Lifetime Premium. Now you have to buy that month-on-month. Greedy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it makes me a goodman"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a very good app . but if unistall it and again install it on another phone then how we can gain our journey diary back"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very versatile as I can use it on my PC, tablet and phone. Easy to use and very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really like this app. I adore how easily it auto syncs between devices. Would like to see a mood tracker with associated data gathering (as in daylio) and to be able to customise text with different font styles, colours and word art. UPDATE 4.4.19 Like the mood tracker journey has now but I would still like to be able to customise text better. I'd like to be able to emphasise important text by chaging colour, text style and highlighing parts of my writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal i know."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Profoundly happy with this app. i was a DayOne user previously and was happy with their application, but their Android support was sub-par, there was no windows desktop app, and their web app didn't work. Journey is everything i wanted! Excellent Android app, effortless cloud sync, seamless access via every platform I use. Very very happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful note pad. Easy to operate and very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i would like a refund please. i just ordered this 1 hour ago and not happy with the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app and very simple and intuitive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This application is very convenient. I use the free version and have not had any problems. I recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for over 7 years now. I still enjoy it. It's one of my all time favorite apps. I like how versatile it is across different platforms. Everything is always synced up, and I can access from all of my devices. Journey is bug free. I love the fact that it doesn't bombard me with adds and ""friend"" requests. It's private, personal and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The bulk export function used to be free but now it is only available in the paid version? Does that mean that unless I pay up, I will not be able to transport my entries to another journal?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love , it's easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gives me a quick way to record how I am feeling through out the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"combination of popup prompting entry reminder AND notational reminder duplicate ideas unaware of each other. This takes a daily extra acknowledgement. a better default list view could offer greater date range viewing if message was succient mode. toggle detsil list view with the verbose mode currentally offered."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app as it helps in practising mindfulness."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful apps to keep track of what you did and be able to recall with ease when you you need it...a must have for people with deteriorating memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"like how this app allows me to document thoughts anywhere and allow me to track to shifting of my mind over the months and years of recording"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"update may 1: I've been using it for a while now and all has been good. I've gotten the lifetime premium. Good app but the Windows sync needs work. Several times I've written entries on the computer only to find that they have not saved, and I have to write it all again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love being able to just jot a line when i can"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really liked this app. its really a personal diary. i write wholebimportant things in this.since its linked with our account we can retrive it from anywhere .I really recommed all of you. I'm using a free version but still i loved with its features... ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy keeping my diary with Journey! It's so easy and convenient. I have it both on my PC and on the phone, so can write whenever I want. It has tags and search function, location and weather... just perfect for my memories! And they'll never be lost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really enjoying using this. nice and easy, lots of cool features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use, convenient, secure. love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple, unobstructive and elegant"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Beautiful app overall. I have had it since basically day one. However, lately like pretty much every single app developer, they have found a gimmick that can pay well. You want night mode, which is pretty much free and standard on all other apps? Well we are going to hit you with a pay wall with about a dozen features you will never use or need. Why? On top of that I had already had the lifetime membership, it was not clearly explained, and I still paid for the membership by accident."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy using Journey as a way to keep track of our trips. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"if you dont buy the upgrades they hound you, but in the end I did go membership option and love being able to use the platform across my Mac's windows and android phone. could use it on my iPad too probably. great platform, just relentlessly with the upgrade adverts. oh and sometimes the timer to alert you goes off and you go to add an entry and then it keeps reminding you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome ! Smile, journaling is great. i love this journal alot ! No fooling, try it anytime you like, 😋 remember to eat right and well. Blessed be you the person reading this all by yourself, for you are the God=Unconditional Love ~ The LAW of Humanity . Terra Nova is our Kingdom of Life. Have a nice day and Please Remember to walk in Peace so that Peace is always with you on in strength and Beauty with all you do and say."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you can't cancel the subscription and I've been trying to get a refund and they respond"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. it's the first journaling app I've stuck with."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"just what I needed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank tou so much.Will wait for the next upate.Have sent email.Recent update has resulted in flickering screen when an entry is selected to view.Its disturbing to eyes.As informed,I will wait for update to have this fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoyed using journal over the past couple weeks. The ability to upload photos and video is nice, allowing me to document moments from my life that I otherwise wouldn't bother with. I can see me continuing to use this for years to come!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using this journey almost 4 years, and it's still feels great. I can write my journal everytime I want. Not just only in cellular phone, but also I can write and read in web based. Thank you Journey, you make my day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this Journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"What is the difference between the paid and free version? Very confusing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't know what it is but I love this app to pieces."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very very satisfied with the app, but i think the ios version isn't as good as the android."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but then something happened and there are these incessant pop ups and trying to get to where i can drop a quick note becomes frustrating. i had been using this to catch quick thoughts, ideas and suggestions, but by the time i get to the screen where i can enter, the concept of quick has been lost. So sorry i made entries on this app as now i have to move them to another platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The layout of the application is easy to use...it also has a lock make sure no one else can see what you wrote. Highly recommend using this application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I only use this app in a very basic way, no problems . I type words, it saves and catalogs them. easy as pie."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal app. I love the throwback entry feature and the ability to add photos or videos. The reminder to write notification is also a great feature. The night setting is so helpful since I'm usually using it in the evening. I also like that I can change the date and time on any entry. I use Journey almost daily. Thanks for making such a lovely and helpful app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"edited 28.4.19... App is getting better. Privacy is now automatically protected when I save a journal entry, but not if I edit one. I just started using this app. there seems very little security or privacy, for instance it doesn't ask for fingerprint. also if I click on the Samsung button to bring up recent windows, you can clearly read my private journal entry. surely this should not be visible unless you are in the app itself"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This App upgraded and lost all my entries. Beware."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"i switched device and cannot restore my purchase"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sounds nice but I will not be using this app. You are required to have a membership to use the app and are automatically signed up for a 7 day free trial upon creating an account. If I had been given a choice durring the sign up process I may have considered giving it a try. This just seems dishonest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this on and off, but this is a great way to record what is happening at work, life, whatever. i don't use the mood features right now (too much going on to reflect on that), but I'm sure it's useful to some. The only issue i have is that it always pinpoints my location at a nearby address, never my home or my office (not the app's fault). it would be great to indicate a regular location if you're detected within a certain range of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellenté"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"خوراک خاطرات"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, and I love the auto sync option"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"ads are a little annoying always trying to get you to signup for premium but it's free and is user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been loving this app, but i wish it was more streamlined with Google Photos where you can include multiple attachments into one entry directly from within a specific Google album, or vice versa."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good for business mapping and notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had generally had a pretty good experience with journey, until I asked for a refund for the premium service (within hours of purchasing it) - it's a reasonable amount of money, and it didn't fix the issues with cross platform syncing the way I'd hoped it would. I've asked for a refund five times, and have been alternately ignored and told the request has been 'rejected' without any clarification as to why. I really wasnt impressed with this customer service and wont be using journey again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use. glad i can remember blessings through this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and clean interface just to write dairies"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love it easy to use and to share"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When I first tried the application I immediately liked it even though I already had a similar application. But for me the lifetime premium price is still too expensive, can I get a 50% discount for premium lifetime? LOL 😅"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the idea. So handy."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"app is good for what it says"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am diabetic and I use the free version of the app about once a week to track my progress through my fight to reverse it. Awesome for simple journal entry logging."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use when you don't have a traditional Journal. ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very lovely and easy to use."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never crashes for me and is more convenient then carrying a notebook."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent application"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"its a good app, feels like diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like this Appbut it's tied to Google Drive and it's really not Good on the PRIVACY Front.. I contacted the developers about that issue and asked for my money back.. They just blew me off..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excelent app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"High quality app. Versatile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Highly reviewed so I'll try it again to see why I'd already deleted it. Then I'll revisit this review."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"gud"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Great UI. No Ads!!! Thanks for that . I understand that you are working very hard to build the app but right now giving you five star is all I can do for you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"A truly brilliant scam. It pretends to be safe and easy to keep the files for when the app will shut down its services, but that is part of the paid features that give you what is essentially a glorified blogging tool. Get yourself a WordPress blog, it'll give you the same features and more. Hard pass."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helpful. documenting ones journey is one of the most clarifying things"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"like this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"have used this for 2 years. Love it!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It survived my app tranfers when i got a new phone. I had to still transfer it to the new phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why am I being charged for another lifetime premium? I brought those wayway back and just because I stopped using it for a while it doesn't mean I won't comeback."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's beautiful app to record your moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite journal with Android and desktop support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"#!@$% $30 a year?!? Are you serious APP STUDIO??? Shameful. Ridiculous. Opportunistic in a parasitic kinda way. ***EDIT 4/22*** Dear Developer, grow up. take responsibility for the marketplace YOU selected."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"BEWARE! UPGRADING WILL RESULT TO IT CREATING A NEW ACCOUNT FOR YOU AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO TRANSFER OLD ENTRIES TO NEW ACCOUNT. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. 6 MONTHS LATER AND THEY STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND STILL DISREGARD ALL ISSUES INVOLVED BY GIVING ME GENERIC Q&A INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE NOT APPLICABLE."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app. It's easy to use and helps me stay organized."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this for my journaling. I love to.journal my thoughts and feelings to track.my habitable my codepency"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best dear diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I purchased the lifetime membership tier with the app, but i still keep getting asked to upgrade my tier with kore subscriptions. they madenit look like my first purchase was all I needed. but clearly not. super scammy. I would have continued using it, but i really dont know how."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Cancelled this service because i just didn't use enough and was charged again for another annual subscription! There is nothing in the app that instructs you on how to cancel the service. Reach out to them and have yet to hear from them. BUYERS BEWARE!!!! Update: The developer responded finally saying to cancel the subscription from google play. Only i had..and they still charged me for another year. Deceptive company. DO NOT TRUST!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm just starting with it but so far am loving it and have journaled far more then I have before. The convience of having it on my phone makes it so much easier to remember to journal and having the ability to add pictures to my musings adds another level to my writing where sometimes my words fail me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it. its so easy to use. its perfect because I love journaling and I can't always pack my paper journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent journal. wish more feeling option emojis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love using Journey when I go on trips as a trip diary. Though I lost a LOT of my data when I changed phones.😣"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"dont like baving to pay for an app wjen i can do my own on paper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect option so far to write your own journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant diary app. I would suggest just one improvement on the current version and that would be to have a, ""home"" when tagging a location instead of searching each time. By the way, did I mention it was brilliant?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Almost perfect the only issue I have is the cost to unlock all the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Meh. I have been through a great many journaling apps over the years some better than others but none ticking all the boxes (I've since found it but not this app). This one is okay, it provides the basic features but nothing that makes you say wow. I found myself continuing to search for different journal apps while using this one. It's not horrible but it's not a five star app either."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you! restored and ressolved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app keeps asking me to pay for the upgraded version when I first enter the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, so convenient!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"since last update screen will not rotate when composing a new entry on my tablet"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am pleased with this app just need to find out how to retrieve my data as my mobile phone was stolen."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The cross-platform access, location tracking, and incremental improvements are keeping me happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"garbage"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for personal & business"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its beeb good so far telling me were going to and how to get there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Memories are kept!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helpful app to keep our life journey... thanks.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"cant disable notifications. app somehow draws a quick add entry window on top of other open apps, but it doesnt have that permission, and notifications are blocked."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is really wonderful to be able to jot down my thoughts then attach photos to go along with the narrative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it has taken me a few days to get used to the features on this app but once I learned what I needed it has been a very useful application.like all apps now it seems they do a very poor job of general documentation and you must learn it on your own by poking around but I am convinced that this application is worth your time to learn."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Could you integrate with Pebble Time like you did with Android Wear? I would love to be able to quickly save moments that are special to me by having Journey set as a shortcut on my Pebble. That way, I could make a quick note of what I'm doing, and journey would save the time, place and weather of that event."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I used to like this app very much. It was simple and nice. Now, they've implemented tiers and memberships, and they keep pushing notifications about sales and other spam. It's infuriating. There are no notification settings, so I can only completely disable them via Android, or I have to deal with the spam, if I want a reminder. There's an ""upgrade/not now"" screen every time I log in. Now that they've got a good user base, they're holding our previous entries hostage. Ridiculous, and pathetic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"E utilă dar n-aș folosi așa ceva foarte mult timp."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I forgot my password as I have the app locked and now there is no way to recover it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I had been liking and using this app for a long time and even bought lifetime premium and now the last few days I have been getting popups to pay for the app. It seems this is the new way to do business and I can tell you that it is not, piss enough people off and your Journey will be over in the app making business."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"cannot attach audio and photos in the same entry, a short coming"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this most mornings as a journal after reading in my Bible. As I read through the Bible in a year, I write down the verse God seems to be bringing to my attention. Then I write out an action step to help m live out what I read. However you use this app, it's always worked perfectly and I've really enjoyed using it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Edit: This latest update is pretty slick. Despite it's foibles, this app is worth it. Also i just remembered that instead of a subscription, it also has a lifetime premium option, which is much appreciated in the era of everything-as-a-service. This would be a five star app except for the fact that it nagged me constantly to get me to do the subscription thing. Even after subscribing it nagged me a few times. Then it also nagged me about reviewing it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app and how easily it syncs between devices. Also how the premium prompts me to write when I dont feel like it. Keeps my productivity up when I can reflect every few days. Really a wonderfully simplistic journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This was a great simple app for the first couple years I had it. Now it has constant notifications and popups that I can't block so I've now uninstalled it and have to look for an alternative."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"app is getting worse with every update, especially now there's an ad constantly at the bottom."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app to pen your daily thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very great app, works as advertised"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very practical and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far there are ads whenever you interact with the app, but their own ads, not a third party. I'm Ok with it, but they are too often. I understand that they want to promote their services, but it's nice to give a break once in a while. Also their lifetime subscription is too high... If they gave out more of a discount and more often, then it would be a nice incentive to buy. I like the app overall, I'll make another review later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app, been using for like 4,5 months. It provides a great way to preserve your memories by writing your daily experiences. Thank you so much developers, for this awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actually bought this app. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Use it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using it for 3 years now, great app for storing memories. The only thing is that the premium version doesn't transfer to the pc app when u buy it for the phone app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"we should pay the money or it is free?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"boring and confusing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's my favorite and I've tried a few!!!😊😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app loving"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great Journaling app! I'd recommend it for anyone looking to journal or record events. There's a markdown guide online teaching how to implement several of them, including headers and even a table!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it, but really upset you have to pay for it now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i've used a lot of apps and i like this one the best. i just turn the mic on and go and this google voice typing does the rest... and searchable, so easy, transparent ... i like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app and worth being on the front page of your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The Good: Solid diary app, exportable to PDF, DOCX and in JSON format through ZIP. Themes are gorgeous. Ability to track weather data is also nice, Diaries are often a nice way to record your emotions and can help tremendously when life is rough. I first discovered this app in the midst of an abusive relationship, it was nice to be able to write down my feelings in a safe, private environment. The Bad: When exporting multiple diary entries, only the first 15 will be exported. I attempted this with each exporting option; PDF, ZIP, DOCX. They all ended on the 15th diary entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thanku soo much for made this app. its really simple and very very useful in my day to day life. god bless u whole team"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use app. My go to journal to store God's instructions for my life. A gold mine of wisdom."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I love this app for the main reason it's very easy to use for keeping track and logging my seizures. but I may need to switch to a specific seizure app because this is becoming ridiculous with the pushing and shoving to become a member. I mean, RIDICULOUS!! As soon as I click the app open, as soon as I click on to write a log, then as soon as I close out of my log! It's IRRITATING!! The app is great other than that but the 1 star stays due to the pushing and shoving in my face constantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's been great! It allows me to get that stuff crammed in my head in writing. Very simple open and start sharing your thoughts."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it . user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app.does all I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App is descent, but customer service is terrible. I lost my phone and was charged for the app when I tried to restore the phone. I emailed them for a refund, never even heard back. I also asked what did I pay for because I am still using the app the same way I did before, no word either. They just took the money. What does it mean by restore purchase? Will it downgrade the app and issue a refund?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, ready to use, very full featured."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does everything is is supposed to do. easy to use."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I've read all sorts of wonderful reviews, so decided to give it a go. several 'next' presses later, I'm at a 'start your free trail' screen with a small indicator informing me I'll be billed after a week. i decline, only to be met with a 'flash sale' screen, 50% if i pay yearly, but I'm given 1 minute to make that choice and if i dismiss the offer it's gone forever. i still haven't actually gotten into the app yet. let your product sell itself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Didn't realize I had to pay for this service. Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great service, best available"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So many people here complain about excessive advertisement on the app, nothing done to fix that. I loved journal because it used to give me feeling of peace and simplicity, now it's so terribly annoying, there is nothing good about it left. Deleted forever and will buy account from those who don't force it on users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be a major improvement if the app autosaved entries. I spent more than an hour writing an entry today; than I ran the app in the background, and since I didn't enter it for too long, when returning to the app the whole entry was ereased... Edit: Auto save now works properly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i been using this app to write but recently i accidentally deleted some paragraphs and clicked saved. how do i revert this to my last or yesterday data? please help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"ok so far...some features seem kind of unwieldy but haven't had a chance to really explore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is my go to diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love it."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app!! excellent on every level!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. Keep up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Expensive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an easy way to journal. When we go on trips, I find the limit of 10 photos a day very restrictive. When I go to my child's school concert, I find the one video limit restrictive. If it's storing on my phone I would think I could store more. But I like this app and am happy to journal daily with it. I am happy with my purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple way to jot down life's experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. Id like to be able to add a theme and in the mobile version you cant add an activity such as walking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'll write a well-thought-out review once I have checked out your app . this is really writes up there with one of those about stupidest things I've ever seen how can you answer these questions from the get-go when you download the app until you've experienced and worked in the app come on people get with the program if you're ignorant and haven't ever been talk that's one thing it can be corerrected if you're stupid just go on and Quit ya job because you just can't fix stupid"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is what you needed for your diary or blogging needs. I am so satisfied with this. Planning to buy the lifetime :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Journaling has been a part of me for over 35 years. Although I enjoy pen to paper...time, experiences and technology have moved me to a better way of expression. This is It! Thinking about it - do It! Record your thoughts and experiences anywhere anytime. Nothing needed but what you already have...your phone and your experience. Enjoy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good, simple to use app that functions perfectly as a journal. I love that it's very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Super Journal! This app works with my thinking, writing, creativity, and photos. Keep adding more features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, love the detailed features & customizations! You guys really did a great job! Please keep it up!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When I first started using it 2 years ago I didn't really like it but with all the recent updates I enjoy using it now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"sounds good but won't let me cancel my subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is cool. Finally I have a great journaling tool for my ADD, squirrel on crack brain."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"4.5 Stars. Only thing i don't care for is that it constantly asks if you want to upgrade. Otherwise it suits my needs perfectly! Extremely useful and well designed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Is a great little app for preserving your thoughts, memories, and experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i loved this app. but the new updates have ruined the experience. it always shows ads frequently. excessive ads are so irritated. and i am unable to download my media from past entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is a monthly subscription. Doesn't give the option for a one time purchase. Didn't give the app a try cause I'm not willing to look past this issue."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Horrible! I was led to believe that I was getting a free trial & would be charged a discount price at the end of the trial if I chose to keep the app but that was not the case. I was charged immediately for the app. I did not like the app & cancelled very quickly. I contacted the company multiple times regarding a refund with no response. I contacted customer service multiple times to be told that if I didn't get a response then my refund probably wasn't going to be granted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfectly simple Journal app with a lot of optional features, like adding pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pay n Use -----this type of I dont like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for more than a year now. Perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app but PLEASE BRING BACK THE SEARCH BUTTON. I have 250+ entries over the past two years and I really love this app but it is really difficult to find specific entries without the search button, since I organized each entry by giving it a little title. Alternatively, could you make it easier to assign a tag to multiple entries? For example some option to select entries and give them all a tag. thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can you support  clip and paste picture? Maybe gps logging!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"this app is alright. it gives throwback notifications to remind you of what you have written in the past. one thing i don't like is that i purchased premium on mobile but it does not translate to PC, both of which I use interchangeably. just seems like a money grab not to link them together."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great journaling app that allows you to write, use video, audio, and photo to record your journey in life. love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The ap is very user friendly..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so nice app. thank you for the simplicity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, does all I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app very much. It does a lot of what i want/need. Normally, I'm not a journal writer, but since we bought a caravan, i wanted an app to record our trips. I had checked out a few apps, ＆ this one was the closest app for my needs. I don't need the membership upgrade, as i can't justify a subscription. I'm open to the premium version, although there's some membership options i wish i could have, such as the inspirations. i'd give 5 stars for the option to add some options to the premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's so easy and it helps to know where you were and adding pictures to the words is super easy! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best of Breed right here - >> Journey takes the cake, the baker, and the bakery!. It is great to see a well developed application especially among all the for lack of a better term ""garbage"" that is out here. Most apps nowadays are unstable, insecure, do not fubction properly, and or introduce problems for the unit and additionally are just payload delivery ads by the dozens- Journey is well done! this one exceeds expextations and functionality ! *** Great job and kudos to the Dev Team ***"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"truly the best app I've used on phone. thank you for making this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep your journal going while traveling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ok, no not just okay but awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this for a long time. User friendly. Just wish I could save more than 1 picture in 1 post. But overall, great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic...easy to use and productive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought the Android version not realizing the computer version had to be purchased also..sent email to company the day I bought it asking for a refund, that was a month ago and still no response. Sketchy company... in regards to my refund being rejected, my email was the day of purchase and never replied. Your company took $14 and never responded to an email!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. need an app for daily journaling similar to this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Too much ad for the premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"was exactly what I was looking for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I tried the app one evening and good or not this wasn't actually what I was looking for so I uninstalled it right away and a month later I got billed for a subscription I never intended to take. I feel robbed of 40$ and despite my research I couldn't find a way to get a refund."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"waited for an app like this for a long time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My ardour for learning and passion of writing never get exhausted because of this app...love to keep this app as a true friend of mine...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app! Must have for the ones who wish to make note of their daily activities. Easy to keep records and getting back to them even easier. Does support secure access, so the data remains private! Only thing that the add-ons or the premium support comes at a significant price! Good luck for the future developments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Extremely predatory, persistent, and manipulative sales tactics. Super disgusting. Don't even bother."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple and easy with a lot of options"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use even for someone just starting to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! For a Diary/Calendar Journal! You have made my life so much GLORIOUS! For all my memories to forever remember!😊😊😊😊😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to preserve your ideas! I had a pretty serious data loss when I transferred phones, but this is still a magnificent app. I would recommend making paper copies of all your entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it has a fake editors choice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, very minimalistic 👍🏼"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"3 years and counting of happy journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent app, i use it as a daily journal and more, no glitches found so far a"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Really annoyed that every time I log in it asks me to pay for the service, and the X to close that page is all the way in the corner. I practically have to drop my phone to close it out. staph harassing me with your giant paid window."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall excellent app, however I opened a pop up or side menu accidentally but I don't know how I did it. Tried everything I could think of to open it again but can't find it now. The tutorial doesn't seem to give instructions/help utilizing any of the shortcut or sidebar/sliding menus. That would be helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Love the app but they charged me twice for a membership and have ingored my emails. Like i said, love the app, but wouldn't recommend it, unless you don't mind being charged more than what they say."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was charged 29 dollars but never upgraded the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this ^o^"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it p iss e s me off to no end to download an app, do all the sign in bs and then to find out it's a bloody subscription. UNINSTALL! Be effing upfront with this stuff!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"unhappy. nothing in descriptions tell you you have to subscribe to a monthly fee after the 7 day trial. would have liked to see that up front."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very fast and reponsive app. Not many free functionality like evernote. but evernote is much slower."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. it makes rhe journalling experience an absolute joy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantasic app but could do with a button for camera on home screen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great and useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"super journal app. but im uninstalling the app because im just 13 and dont have any back account to pay for premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its awsm"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it helps. i like it. i recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect for journaling, just capturing thoughts, checklists and anything that you would tropically want to pen down and file away.. life enhancing..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app.. perfect for all my notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app and i have the paid version its awesome i use it almost everyday!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok, then I have nothing to complain about."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Functionally it's okay . I don't like the appearance, it doesn't look much like a real journal. It's difficult to format. But it synchronises okay ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"why make an app free if its only ""free"" for 7 days? and pay to write YOUR own thoughts? what the hell?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so far so good, except for the constant pressure to upgrade"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good looking app. One of the best I have used. Would like to see some further development like having multiple journals for example"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have always loved it. It holds a story for me, a beautiful one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"While I like the idea of being able to quickly journal a thought or inspiration whenever and wherever while it's all fresh. Journey was unable to resolve the issue I had with them, not giving me a membership that I paid for, so now I am waiting on my refund. My suggestion is just stick to the basic free version, because if your experience is like mine they'll take the money out of your account and not upgrade your membership."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not sure yet, I need time to determine if it will meet my needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it works, and is delightful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I just bought Lifetime Premeium, thinking I would use it in different devices but one installed PC App, it asked for more purchase; I could not even open the journal. In iOS too, they asked me to buy Lifetime Premium license again. My advice, use free version only. I felt like very much cheated."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Do exactly what it advertised."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is easily one of my have-to- have apps. Simple and and very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"tons of obnoxious ads for an incredibly simple app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app ever its seriously change my life 😁😁😁😁😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Nice interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easier than Evernote for simply writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I haven't had a problem with this app. I can record my thoughts and pics whenever I want. It's also interesting when they show you a throwback entry. I especially like that it gives you the option to back date your entry if you are adding a pic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really good apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"hello! can you add an option that the daya can be moved to the sd card? it will be a huge help for me. thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app to keep your thoughts written down"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I need in a journal Does it all and is used over 3 platforms"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use. simple and clean looking. love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"keep crashing after the recent update. Just love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best apps to record your daily journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Gets the job done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just installed it and really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what was needed....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"decent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i can not withdrawal after i purchased and bad experience with this app. this app complicated and not worth to used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Location (wrong address) appears in entry even when location turned off in settings. App offers little for price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient app. It does a neat job in storing memories and photographs in one app, sync to all devises may it be on mobile or pc. Good job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Too expensive for what it is. Especially when apps like Memorize are the same or better, yet completely free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love the app. However when I reached out because my online journal didnt reflect the subscription I bought from the app, I never heard back from customer service after giving my order numbers. Still unable to use the desktop program."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like that you can keep going back the same day and either add or start a new entry. I really like that you can put pictures also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy. useful. flows. ... [ wishlist for developers: audio recordings (translate to text); select cover photo for attachment; re-order attachments.]"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app has help me by keeping my thoughts short sn sweet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Privacy agreement is concerning. Fee structure not clear until app is installed. Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I am recovering from many years of addiction. This app is helping me to enjoy and remember the little moments! Easy to use and it will auto add dates and times from pictures. The only thing I have run into that is negative is... you can only upload 4 pictures or 1 video per entry with the FREE version. PS. I cannot wait to get the paid version! UPDATE! Really worth it to buy the lifetime version! More photos per upload, customizable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Upgraded twice over the years. Used to be a really good app, but now it keeps undoing my earlier lifetime upgrade while sending me daily reminders to subscribe as a member."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good but so much expensive. Edit. Paid the lifetime offer but stills pop ups notifications for more offers, it's so annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Poor.... Didn't let me try all the features without keep pushing me to buy. Why would I buy without trying all features if they work the way I wanted. I would have paied doubled the amount had all the features worked according to my expectations"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great options like set time & location, add pics...etc. It does what I need it to do, but constantly asks me to upgrade. No other complaints."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The journal writing experience itself is very good, but I expect a smarter notification system from this premium product: why does a reminder pop up even though I already wrote an entry? Why don't the existing notifications disappear automatically when I write an entry? These little things are a bit annoying when they occur on a daily basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good! it keeps organized on which date you create a entry but theres only a problem, whenever i leave the app it says it crash,even when I change my music it always crash."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The more I use this app, the more I like it. Enter your events every day and in 30 years you can relive your past as I have done reading my mom's diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Could maintaining a diary be any simpler"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I did not find out that this app is$30 annually until after it was installed. AND they get to access your entries, as well as, let Google use them. (Of course they promise not to abuse the access. They just need the access to serve you *wink wink nudge nudge*.) It would be helpful if that was stated up front."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's definitely replace my facebook (and it's absolutely private). But please provide bigger fonts. I'm not a teenage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so helpful in many ways"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had this application for years. if you write and who doesn't; you know how quickly those sparks of genius dissipate and are lost. Not with Journey. Thanks to those responsible for creating a app that actually accomplishes it's goal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Incredible app that does everything it needs to do. I love being able to easily post pictures and videos about my day. The app is very simplistic and doesnt allow for fancy colours and stuff which I think is great because it forces you to focus on what is important - actual journaling. After 6 months of using Journey I converted to the lifetime membership and have no regrets. I love the night mode as well! I haven't really used the google fit integration, or tagging as much though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect for making notes!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"DOES what it Says. Pretty much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I would have given this five stars except that I purchased the lifetime upgrade and the app is still asking me to upgrade and I can't use any of the features. Now, I've basically just wasted my money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app in my opinion. Been using it for several years and works well for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👌👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the app, but I think it should have many books options. I want to create a journal only for food, other to bodybuilding records, etc... It's sad that it is only one option to insert new notes and I can't separate them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ador faptul ca poti edita textul in Markdown syntax. Folosesc aplicatia mobila pe Android si cea de desktop pe Mac si functioneaza foarte bine impreuna. Este o aplicatie reusita si fata de alte aplicatii unde trebuie sa platesti un abonament lunar/anual (e.g. Day One), aici ai lifetime subscription. Recomand! Andrei, Bucuresti"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app ...and i love that starry black sky ...wow so beautiful i want more like that over all your design everything is perfect ....so beautiful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderfull app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A useful e-companion in my spiritual journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"V Good App its help me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"satisfied"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Giving three stars because it has a mood system and you can track your mood over the past month. Neglecting two stars because of your poor response to those who complain about the constant advertisement. ""Want us to go away? Pay money for things you won't use! :)"" You should not constantly be pushing your customers to buy buy buy. It will only turn off people."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is right for me. It just blends in my daily routine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful and feature full. Does it's job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm an upgraded user, this app is well designed and useful for both personal and professional applications. This is one of those rare apps which I don't bother to check reviews before I update in the play store because I trust that they will never wreck it. Quality throughout. Kudos to the developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that the app reminds me to write every night. I may not do it every time, but I like the reminder. I also like that I can add pictures and even has you go through with prompts and it gives you ideas for a quick write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"By far the best I've used and its interface is really easy to navigate"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfect. I couldn't be happier. Update to my first review 3-25-19. Hey guys. I just wanted to chime in with my feedback on your latest update to the app. Basically in a nut shell... GOOD JOB. The fix for the ""search"" function is awesome. It was very frustrating before the update. The ability to print from the top menu is another awesome update. I'm very happy with the changes and that's not usually the case. Thanks again guys. keep up the good work. Bob."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"An online diary, with flashbacks and links to other apps, great for watching your life back in pictures, feels and thoughts. carpe diem, this is how you can see where you came from and where you're going to <3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Catharsis at it's best! recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Flexible, easy to make entries and retrieve data."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The notification again and again for premium membership is very irritating ! I hope to get rid of it very soon !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It very practical. I'm using it everyday to help keep records of my work activities and personal activities. Like the ""tag"" feature to quickly fing certain entries with the same topic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"pretty much what I would expect from a journaling app. cross platform capability, simple and hassle free to use. good job devs, highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Looking forward to using this app for upcoming holiday. I have used it on tablet before and it's great. I especially love the date and time stamp. I'm hoping it has voice to text and ability to print."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"used to be fine, now each time after adding an entry i'm bugged into buying their premium subscription. if i'm not interested once, i certainly won't be 2 minutes later. also i can't export my entries without paying first."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a very cool and easy to use app for Journaling. I enjoyed using it so much, I got the full version. I encourage you to try it. it has easy dated entries and you can add images too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app ..very helpfull"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"fairly easy & straight forward to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for a while a really like it but when it updated all the setting options became invisible? I found them eventually by pressing random places on the screen but for some reason they're not visible so I just have to guess. One other thing is that this app won't turn sideways on my phone even with screen rotate on which is really annoying when I want to use my bluetooth keyboard to type."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"its got what you require for a tec diary nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Apparently there is no way to cancel/unsubscribe my membership. how is that even possible/legal?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm happy with the app. makes it convenient. I really like some of the features available on the mac and wish they were available to mobile and PC. like filling out a journal entry based on a template. subscription is confusing. im paying for one but not sure what i get."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Location tagging now works as it should, great job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"good. but u cannot post photos in ur desired place. they are just attached, thats all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works great. I've been adding old entries and you change the date on the app for each one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"enjoy using the app. so upgraded it to premium. there were certain issues, but i like the way the support team worked to help resolve the issue. Good going !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"premium login keeps on disappearing. restore purchase does not work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent. I am using this app from past 8 months. It's very helpful to maintain personal diary. I was looking for same. This App is perfect match. Thanks a lot for creating such simple but excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Sadly Lost My Phone And had to Change Mail Id.Unable to Restore My Premium Purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very simple app with purpose! Helps me to be updated with my bullet journal! I can't replace the physical bujo but can't miss any moments either! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"compliments 10. complaint 0"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"update:: I just want to say im a HUGE fan of journey. I just love the conveience and everything it has to offer. If you are a person who loves to journal then I would highly recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"很好的dayone模仿者"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"My husband and I travels. i was looking for an app where i can write my experiences and remember as much the places we go to. With journey I am able to chronicle everything that we do, places visited, and simple tidbits that needs to be remembered."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app, but if you can add handwriting as an other way to input then it will be outstanding app ever. I'm using galaxy note with Spen and would love to write things down, especially in diary app like this 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good App. I have used it every day since I downloaded it and am happy I subscribed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app allows me to journal and talk the way I feel and it without nobody have to read what I put down"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really LOVE it but... why did you change the icon with the last update? why did you make it a circle? (not vital but... 😊)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best jounaling app ever... Simple and since new upgrade much, much nicer, because of the customization options (theme, font, wallpaper...) Thanks!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this app is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"App seems good so far, but the constant aggressive advertising of their premium subscription is getting in the way of me just using the app and it's so annoying. I'd happily pay a bit one time for an app like this, like maybe £5 or so, but I'm not going to commit to paying regularly for something I only just downloaded when I'm not sure if I even like it yet. Makes me consider just uninstalling it honestly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"UPDATE   So the latest on the debacle displayed below. The main issue I see with the App is that the payment process and the App account is completely disconnected, but the user is not informed.   I create an account and payment method inside the App but cancelling must happen outside the App through the App store. That's a major oversight. I can delete my account inside the App but that doesn't communicate with my subscriptions inside Google Play - so you can end up with a user with no account but still subscribed to the service.  Please fix it.  ---  Cancelled before trial end and still charged me whole year. Still waiting for refund.  UPDATE - After trying to contact the developer twice through their helpdesk to no avail, they now accuse me of blackmailing them. I did sign up for a trial and then decided that it wasn't for me, I cancelled my account before the end of the trial - which is hard due to how hidden that option is in the App - and the developer still charged me for a whole year.   After raising the issue twice through their helpdesk I left a negative review, their response is to accuse me of blackmailing them.  Unbelievable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome, it's a fun and user-friendly way to record your thoughts every day. I've never been successful at keeping a paper journal but this is so easy to keep up with. I love that I can include pictures and rate my day. I think it's been good for my mental health, too. So happy I have this journey app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The 18th March April has cancelled my lifetime premium? Whats wrong with this app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For Dev: would be cool to see a question a day implemented!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful in so many ways. No other journal app even comes close. This is absolutely amazing! One thing I hope can be improved is when it says, stationary, driving etc. Many times it says im driving while im standing still. Might be fine after but it shows that after I merely had a short walk then stopped to journal. I guess ive always been told I walk fast but jeez lol. Other than that it is still the best hands down. Keep up the good work as it helps me a LOT!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved the new interface!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and convenient. Love that you can add pics!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i bought premium access and still did not get the access to use journey on other platforms. what a waste."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi, great app! I have one request though. Can you program the mood tracker to work without notes? I would like to have a record of my mood every day, while I reserve journal note entries for special days."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic and organized journaling app, i love the tagging feature and ability to include photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"cant cancel"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect app for recording your day ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Draining battery like hell on S10 plus"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's like having a best friend you can write to about Anything and it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super dairy to store u r memorable days with pics ... ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love the app, but the new notification reminders being sent are a step backwards. There are now two reminders sent - the standard notification asking if I'd like to write in the journal, and the new one asking for my mood and whatnot. That's just got poor UX written all over it. The standard reminder is enough. Please get rid of that new emoji reminder."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Thank you for bringing the old way for map (location) viewing back. It is much more convenient and much easier to select a place. The only reason for -1 star is 'cause I'm considering a paid version for a long time now and I'm still not convinced that they aren't too expensive. Keep up the good job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"this app is great and i use it for song writing all the time however my old phone broke and i lost everything i had written so far in 2019 even though it had been uploaded to the cloud as it does everytime you use it. i had some great stuff that might now be lost forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and very secure. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great to get stuff off my chest in private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish more stuff was free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm just download it just for trial, love platform. my question : Can i add more moods and activities for me to choose for each entry, i have used that in Daylio, hope it have this function in Journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Since my memory is getting thin, this helps to capture things when I can remember them...trying to get this app on my laptop so i can sync my thought..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"best daily journal app ive used so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Had some hiccups for migrating to another account with the premium.. solved.. app per say running smoothly, no issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Why is my name now plastered at the top of the main page in large letters? Not very private. Now it feels less safe to use in a public place so will be finding a new app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good. I'm enjoying it. I had an error code issue and management was quick to rectify for me when I contacted them. I still have a difficulty exporting all my entries ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is far best the online Journal that I have used so far!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Smooth. easy use across platform"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I use it more often than I ever did with pen and paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I'm using the free version and it is the best free diary app there is. (Iv tried over 8 of them). Only thing missing is you aren't able to have separate diary's. For now, the tags feature allows you to separate work, school & personal diary. If the feature of adding separate diary's is added it will be a 5 star app for me. Most of the other diary apps have this feature even the most basic diary/journal apps so I don't understand why you cannot add it. Thanks for developing it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😘👍 I love this app !! It's like a mini personal blog and I love the fact that you can share it onto your actual blog as well. It works smoothly and looks great !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, but constant requests to upgrade are annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not useful enough to be paid for. Seems like any note app can accomplish the same things, typically for free. Update: Developer response: Hi James, just to let you know, Journey is one of the top grossing journal app. If your note app can accomplish the things that you want, why find a journal app in the first place? Update: Because I expected more. How am I supposed to know that Journey is inferior to a common note taking app before trying it? Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All around fantastic app. back ups available, tag with location and/or photos and helps keep track of those memories that you think you will never forget...but eventually do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is an essential app on my phone, and is well worth the cost of the paid membership"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it took a bit but having the application on the phone as well as on a computer through an app makes it easy to take notes that can be shared. it's also easy to have it privatized as well. I'm a fan of this app now and I can see why other people are too"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"NOT recommended for 2 reasons. Reason 1 - they never notify you that your trial period is over and charge you the subscription without asking you if you want it. This is what happened to me. I didn't like the app and didn't want to buy the subscription, but I didn't remember when the trial is over and they charged me. I filled in the refund form, never got any reply, wrote to help desk twice, but they did nothing about it. Reason 2 - the app is the same as any free note taking app, nothing cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Can't be used with just any email / requires gmail account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome Simple easy to use. User Friendly app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Help me keep track of my thoughts and moods."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"pretty good! 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I have been looking for a long time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this. my thoughts, and I have so many, I have a book called Thoughts Of She, are protected well until and unless I chose to share."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. my only criticism would be that I can't get rid of the Google Fit card. it's always there even though I deselected it in settings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to keep notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great tool to help organize your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it works for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"no reminder. they just flat out charge you 40 bucks. i dont use it or even have it installed but it cost me 40 dollars now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Spam me? Delete you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple (design, usage) yet interesting. and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i installed the app. It said nothing about having a fee until I had already signed in and created a paaword. Then I was notified this was a 7 day free chance to try the app. Made me mad. Felt tricked."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep an electronic journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great. Fills in the date and time and location so you can just write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"hey there! i bought lifetime premium today. this is me placing my trust in you to develop and support this app nice and well and keep all my memories intact and safe and also give new features, more and more until i die. really tough promise. hope you won't break it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to document life's journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's like my private electronic memoir. I create posts like I woulda Facebook or Instagram post, without making it public. It's for me...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I simply love this app. It's simple and easy and got everything I need. Being using it for a year now. Startarted with the free ver, then got really annoyed by the inside ads to update and upgraded. I am amazed by the full ver! Special thanks to designers and developers! Love the UI! Graphics and motion adds to a greater experience. Love the app and how mush thought and work is put into it. It's important for something so personal like this app. Thanks! Will recommend trying full version!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Coo app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I purchase it for the feature of recording audio...i would too give 5 stars but still I cannot add photo file to an audio memo.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"lost all my posts .not happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Apart from the incessant messages to buy the premiums version, I love the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love jotting down my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Feels like a companion, love the fact that it's always there for my beck and call, at no added effort."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app.It can be improved a lot though update.it has improved a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free. I would change my rating if you were honest from the beginning and you had the fee right up front. someone who is looking for an app like this looking to log there feelings and well life. I would just love when downloading it reflected that actual price like the talking pet app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really loved the theme idea but can you also give an option to apply the theme to our journal entry pages."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant to journal everything in one place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fun diary page photos. graph. hi"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceptional experience both in tablet and on laptop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Really needs to integrate data from Fitbit as well as or instead of Google fit. Wish i had realized it didn't before i paid for all the features. Manual entries of that stuff, when i already have a tracker to do it automagically, is just way too much time taken from other things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hello,I have buy journey ,why when I upgrade 3.0, it tells me that I am not pro?  thanks，I uninstalled it and download it again , it is ok.  It made me angry because I meet this condition first time, I thought I must purchase it again.  developer reply it fast and nice, forgive my poor english"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It help me a lot to expressed what i feel in my writing via JOURNEY!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary app I've ever seen and tried. Never regret joining premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I don't like the map after updating to this new version. The GPS and map are not accurate like before."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very reliable and well-designed app, the in-app purchases are really worth it. Some of the new transitions might need a little more polish and could be faster. An AMOLED-friendly night mode with more blacks would be great for writing at night and I'd also love to choose from more fonts to for instance just keep my system font ""Product Sans"" active."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesom app, helps you remember the life you lived!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The newest update is so coollllll, love it so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very practical. outstanding"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Would have been nice to know that it was an app you had to pay for, I do like the concept behind it, perfect for tracking new meds"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to freewrite type in this app. It is perfect for it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The new update on this app with wallpaper and throwback is amazing. I am enjoying the premium version of this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good good good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best one in the segment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a great way to keep my journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i want this app is free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of the few apps when I at least consider buying the full version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just started using this app an I love it already. thanks a lot!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"customer service takes too long."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loving this app😘"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish there were more in depth options for tracking your mood in your journal entries but otherwise its a wonderfully simple and enjoyable way to journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome for keeping track of your thoughts, moments. attach photos. etc. would br nice to remember these snippets years later"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love journey. i don't write in it that frequently but i've had it for so long now that its definitely my longest lasting journal. i've written in it maybe 20 or so times but over three years,so i get to see the long arc. convienient that i always have it on me. and its nice when sometimes i see a little notification that isnt alerting me to something but just asks 'how have i been?'"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a wonderful app that lets me document my thoughts and feelings. I find it very therapeutic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always wanted such type of app. In Journey you can not only keep the daily details but you can even attach files which might be useful in the future. Using the premium version will be best as it offer you to retrieve the earlier entries in various formats."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful! u bgg use this app all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app till date which i got for Journaling. Also pro features sound good, I'll definately consider buying them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great flexibility, love the interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"convenient and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"很棒"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hi, I was billed for this app which I don't use, kindly return my money as I have did not receive any notification before charging on the expiry date."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is nice and helpful. Sadly it keeps popping up their paid offer everytime I opened it or simply everytime i saved my log. A bit disturbing, but other else is fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice journalling app! wished it can allow photos to fit in the post to user's liking just like a blog post though. That would be awesome !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Immediately uninstalled after I had 3 in app ads pop up consecutively before I could even see what the app looked like."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Phenomenonal. i love the Ui/X. its very clean and somewhat serene."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have forgotten that I have installed this app some years ago on my old gadget but had been inactive since I changed my phone. But then I am grateful to find the records of my years faithfully kept intact when I installed this app again. Thank you for the great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why should i give you all my details then tell me its a monthly payment. Dishonest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Constantly asks you to subscribe. I just wanna type, dammit. Edit: In response to Two App Studio: Yeah. That's annoying, every time you open the app to journal, to say no to 2 different subscription ads. If I said no, it shouldn't be popping up every single time I open the app. If I want to subscribe, I know how. Deleting my account with you, and uninstalling this app, and going to a better journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Was using and finding it helpful but can't log in anymore 😕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"unimpressed i downloaded this after reading the reviews but it automatically says i have to subscribe and pay within 7 days. I would like to choose. I don't want to worry about negative billing. Too bad.. from the reviews it looked like something i might be interested in. also..if i choose not to subscribe I have no idea what i would have access to. i uninstalled it immediatly. i hope that i wont see any charges!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic app, really useful for keeping a diary of what im up to especially as i often dont have a notepad with me but always have my phone. i love the fact that you can save pictures as a visual reminder of what you have done and where you have been which also shows up on a map. highly recommend this to everyone who likes to keep a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app and I like that it sinks to Google so that I can actually keep this information and go back on it later. I use speech-to-text because I have fibromyalgia so this is very convenient. I also like that you can look for things by typing in a word. I always lose my journals so this is great I can actually reference them for what time I take my meds at or when my kids are having problems with things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"PLEASE RESPOND?? I barely used it. I made one entry. It was'nt much and I was going to delete it. I meant to cancel my subscription sooner. I can't pay the $29.99- the card I have on my phone is a giftcard! and it is e m p t y. I am not sure I have a way to pay this and there is already so much on my plate this year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that it works across platforms. Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"you have to pay for it don't get it.it is horrible"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its one of my favourite apps, extremely important to me 💐👌🙏🏻 Thank you dear developer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to record thoughts on the day, though i struggle with the exporting feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic and very user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love that it's so complete with what I can attach to posts. I chose this over similar apps because I could attach video, etc. I would like more flexibility with mood tracking. Five choices doesn't really cut it. Same with activities, let us customise for the things we do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful and convenient for me..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is an amazing app, but I have a question how can get out from the app and then inter again because I don't want anyone to see my privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for almost 4 years now and i love the simplicity. However, i would find writing so much more interesting if there were different text features like bold, italic etc. And the constant ""update"" ads are very...disturbing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"solid app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to track, media document, and track with date, time, and location of where you were and what happend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent - but one has to ignore the advertisements on the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"i was actually excited about this app until i installed it and it sneakily tried to loop me into a recurring paid subscription. i immediately uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi, I'm confident using this app. For most of the reviews I've seen, I have faith for trusting Journey. Thankyou."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything you would want for a journal. I've tried many and this one seems to have everything I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm so glad I purchased the lifetime premium. This allows me to keep my journey entries and export is to the next mobile device that I'm using. I love that the app is clean and minimalistic, never gave me any problems since I started using in 2016. To be honest I don't use it on a daily basis but whenever I update this app, there is always something new. Keep it up developers!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"bagus dan berguna"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app, used other journal apps but love the interface and features on this, even down to their choice of font type!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"would have been even better if linked to email id"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and does what I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"You might aswell just use the notes on your phone for free...what are we paying for?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"my private diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This is only my second time using the app, and I forgot my password. There was no way to reset it. Not convient at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good journy c journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I asked several times for a refund and never got a response. Why not to accept refund when you automatically billed my account without my consent? again - everyone should be very careful from this developer!!! I lost 30$ and can live with it but other should run away. I will contact google play support as well to let everyone know this trick. It was billed automatically after the 7 days trial. I asked the refund the same day... Is it against your policy to be fair to your customers?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!!! Loved it!! This is my first review for any app and I bought it life time membership a while age. Completely in love with the ""throw back entry"" feature. It reminds you how you were a year ago . How your perspective changed since then. Completely worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"WORST AFTER THE RECENT UPDATE I CANNOT LOGIN THE APPS EVEN AFTER ENTER MY PASSCODE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is easy to use and it is fun to go back and read old journal entries. I really like to be able to dictate my journal entries and add photos. I can also upload the entries to the cloud so that my journal doesn't get lost. Update: Well here I am over a year later and still using this app. I wholeheartedly would recommend it for journaling. I have been using this app for over 2.5 years now and I think it is more beneficial with time. Thanks again for developing Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only app of it's kind I've used consistently. I definitely recommend it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"has a reminder to write in it. I like the simplicity of it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Without end to end encryption, I will not use it. I read the article in your response but https is not end-to-end. Bottom line, I don't want Google or anyone to be able to read these entries at any point. A primary concept of journaling is completely personal info. Not interested in giving Google such granular info. I'd pay for a version that allowed me to encrypt & store locally or encrypt it before transfer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I still love your product and it's my go to journal since 2017, but can you please enable landscape mode ? I am using a Bluetooth keyboard whenever I write here so having it in landscape mode will be such big help!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Used this when I was on a vacation cruise so I can always remember the trip! 😁 I only wish I could add photos later without having to change the date."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazinggggggg"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best Jpurnal App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bought premium just to try it. Now Im stuck. I love the app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They claimed to have daily support, but don't. Them ignored my request for a refund of my pro subscription. I haven't even had a chance to use the app because the feature I need (dailio import) doesn't work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really love it. Elegant design with useful features make it more persuasive for me. If you can add categories (folders) in newer version, it will be more perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app. love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used for a few years now with a few different and sometimes multiple devices. Synchs well. Very little data used, day to day Still love the ease of use and security (PIN)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works well for short writings of daily events, thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"after 7 days you have to pay?! disgusting. ive been typing mine out in memos. what a load a garbage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple but great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"dope af!! pretty on point except when im doin speech to text it picks up the voice on other line im talking to lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is just aweosme. I would like to have one option in the app. When we want to write something numbering wise then we have to put numbers on our own. Can you pls make numbering automatic.?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to record thoughts! I love the reminders to keep me on track."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's very simple and easy to use!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An awesome app. i wish i could give more stars. i have been using this app for years now. It has become my friend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"does the job and UI is good, but constant upgrade requests are annoying and there doesn't seem to be an option to turn them off. I just want to write notes and not do anything advanced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Only way to use this is if you have a gmail account. If you don't have one, or want to use a different email, you can't. I do not need to back up my entries, so google drive isnt necessary. Raised my rating from one star to 2 stars, because developer responded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use, nice prompts, layout, photo uploads. Does the job well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, gives you all the features you need, plus, there's a web version too! I actually payed for premium and I don't regret it at all!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me keep track of the small successes in my goals as well as other moments, pics, and brain dumps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this Journal app, now my favourite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"does good for a reminder of when I did what."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Would give 0 stars just installed and already stated it was a trial. Uninstalling no thank you even though it was a recommended app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"图片只能统一放文章开头，不能插入文中。"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the favorite ones... I think I am going to enjoy these journeys later in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"photo and video options are awsome...not able to share the content though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Very easy user interface. You can add a few pictures along with your journaling. You can also view your journal entries in a couple different ways.... chronological, on a calendar, even on a map!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a Great App, I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice UI, easy to use, got some useful little additions and the premium sounds pretty sweet for anyone who needs the full package"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good program for writing daily activities"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic diary journal, I wanted an app to take a photo a day. This is perfect. Take photo on camera then when I'm ready I go to my photo gallery and find photos click share to journey and it creates a page with exact time and date photo was taken, tags locations. I can't recommend this highly enough. I paid for premium as well. Brilliant. Come on stop reading this and download it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is a neat and elegant app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best and simple Jounal App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app as my go-to for every important saved reference and every save on a whim, as well as to jot down some creative ideas and epiphanies. Tagging is useful to track repeating themes in my writings. I may start exploring its other features soon, too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've tried them all. This one syncs across all my devices no matter the brand. It's capable of being as simple or as modern as you like with tons of options like photos, tags, and even GPS."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So ideal to have and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Need to be more editable, i mean options like text wrap picture, or cut out and paste fragment from picture. To make pages more visual like story to share that moment. But app is great any way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously over-priced!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"incredibly good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A place I can share my thoughts with myself and reflect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great way to track you thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for your journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like it alot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app, ive been writing in it almost daily, very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great as a write-as-you-go journal. i'm not really a sns person so i use it to record the places i've been to together with pics and videos for my own memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my day to day reflection and daily goal settings and strategies"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it's easy not complicated I use it for everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love writing my thoughts. I know my journal entries are saved since I have the upper edition of the app which is cheap to buy. I have had issues before with journal apps losing my content after an hour of inspired writing. It also has spell check which I need. It dates and notes my location for every journal entry. I really don't have any complaints. It does was it says. It's a good journal/diary app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"note that there's no money back guarantee. once subscribed you have to pay for the one year subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!!! I have been using this app for 2 years now. changed from a 4 star to 5 star."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"still loving this app very much. the only suggestions I can add would be an increase in the selections of activities and moods. In other words, give us, the users, an opportunity to create and add our own personalized moods and activities. this journaling app is still, by far, the best one I have used"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent Clean Simple Effective Journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, works as described! Only downside is if you get the free version, it bugs you to upgrade rather frequently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to enter information, still exploring other uses"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Painless usage, stabile and nice looking, at the moment satisfies all my needs. For now I stay with free edition, generally I'm happy with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"No problem. Purchased premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works as described. I just have to remember to use it. It has a moderate learning curve."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"really good platform to log a journal across different platforms, windows, android, mac and iOS. I really hope it has more features though. Things like word count metrics, adding pictures on the web interface etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Brilliant...at first... It does everything I wanted and needed it to do, but after the last update the location picker is truly terrible. You were able to search any road and it would find it instantly, but now you have to zoom in on the map (which starts as the entire world map) all the way to the road you want. Ridiculous and I'm considering uninstalling as it's not longer fit for purpose. Also is you try and enter somewhere as a custom location it won't let you save it as a favourite"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the convenience of having a journal at my fingertips."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy way to write in my journal more often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use interface and nice synchronisation between devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have had the app for about 1 year now and it is a very good tool for memory keeping, if I could only remember to write in it. 😂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have Not Used Many Apps like this one. But now I don't even want to try another apps b'coz this one is the Best.,😊😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App charges money when unsubscribing in trail phase!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journey is a useful tool and it is pretty user friendly. If you sign on for the one-time life-time membership it comes with great support. Excellent follow-up from Ellen - really dedicated to helping me learn how to use it. The big flaw in this system is that I am not preparing this journal for myself, as I want to share it with those that care about me, but this is not easy. There are some work-arounds but these are not ideal. Hope the Journey-folks get this worked also, Larry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"what a ripoff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As a depressive anxious individual, this daily check in has been a great tool for me. I have reignited my love for journaling thanks to Journey. I appreciate the work the development team put in to make this easy for folks like me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank you for keeping lifetime premium users in state and not forcing us onto the subscription model! i love this app, it helps me reflect every day for almost 3 years"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE IT! Firstly, the upgrade is affordable and worth it! I used to journal all the time and I fell out of habit as I got older. I still wish I'd take the time to put pen to paper but this allows me to feel like I've put my thoughts somewhere. I can sync it to my Google account so it's never lost, add pics, incorporate Google fit, set reminders, I even use it for my food journal entries. And I love the looking at atlas after my trips! This app really got me into journaling again. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"annoying reminders"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journaling and hitting down your inspiration."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal app on play store. please please please add ""speak to write"" ""checklist"" and ""steps (steps during the day)"" features. Thank you❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Love that I can password protect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love that i can journal on my phone and desktop though i dont love that i had to pay for them separately. i have had several issues syncing both accounts but the help desk jas been helpful. The paid version allows you to post 10 photos or a video to each entry, but i wish i could do both. also, when i do decide to prinf out my entries, i wish there is an option to make the photos smaller as currently eaxh photo takes up 1 page."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helped me connect with my family and myself aa well as fix my account and phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"cool. like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like to use this app. I used it quite often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has made journaling so easy that it's enjoyable. thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love that I can add tags to entries and photos. Easy to quickly write a few lines or something longer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I understand the financial desire to see users upgrade to membership, but the constant requests and ""offers"" never stop. It's a shame, because the basic journal aspect of the app is very nice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it a lot. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal is working really well. i like the reminder it does fir me. thank you for this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"if I could give zero stars I would! not only did I spend the money on this app for one year and from day one none of the member ship features would work! I've contacted support 3 times and requested 2 refunds it's been 2 weeks of me waiting and sending messages. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! developers need to learn how to run their app and if they cant they should refund the money spent for their BS membership features that dont work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what Im looking for. Mobile Journal. private"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When i switched phones what i had written was still saved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Reliable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"there should not be the function ,print or pdf file.its not nasessry. plz remove this function."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that can be used on several devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am loving it so far as a new user. Reason for the reduction in star is that it's missing scribble function for us pen users. It's good to draw a heart or write and draw just like a normal paper. Stamps are also nice. Hope this feature happens in the near future. And clippings too like pics onto the words we write. Loving how clean it looks though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. Great for writing quick notes. Though the continuous offer to upgrade can be annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Secure journal app to record all tasks done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"phenomenal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love tjis app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"useful !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"god leaves in details soo track u r life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a great app, I love it. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thanks for making this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy and useful to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being able to dictate my journal rather than physically write it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Ummm OK I suppose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app. Just one problem that I've noticed. You may change the font size, but it only works when reading saved journal entries. It would be nice to have the font change affect entry of the journal as well. The throw backs are nice, but i can't ""back"" out of the app once i read the throwback."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has been fantastic to be able to write quick thoughts down during the day just using my phone and not having to carry my physical journal with me all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use, I can print and export also"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app for keeping your journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Essential."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"safe and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very nice journal app.. Worth it to go premium. Recommended to all that wanted to take down notes of life's journey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous!!;-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"pretty handy app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's good but the constant popups to upgrade are really annoying. I don't consider this ""as free""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect , I even bought it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really enjoy the app. It is simple and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"grear app! i just find a little annoying that everytime i open the app, i get the offer to purchase the paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Drop the paper and pen. This journal will change your life. It syncs to every device and the cloud. Say goodbye to not having your journal with you or losing your journal. It also gives you ways to search and organize journals entries so it's wayyh faster than trying to find them in a book. Also it's nice to see everyday what I was thinking A year ago on the same day as they send a reminder."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Great application. But you cant back you data up unless you buy the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Journey is pure bliss,but i want to change my email id associated with the account as i dont use it anymore,no feature to edit,a flaw i found."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Smooth Interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I bought premium of this app years ago and it says lifetime. I checked now and its not on premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I did buy the lifetime premium, but the promotion of the member subscription had been frequent and intrusive. Promotion may be necessary for sale, but intrusive ads are disturbing. Otherwise the experience is good and the ability to sync across devices is helpful. / Just found out that Journey has a notification category for fire sale in system's notification settings, so at least it's possible to turn off the system-wide sale notifications. Glad the developer has made it available."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very straight forward and lots of capabilities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love this app im using the free version and its still great. love how i can save journal entries along with up to 4 pics and add location, activity, as well as mood. would have given 5 stars but there are to many adds other then that great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"UPDATED: Very poor design for what I needed. I wanted to export my entries for my manager. But each entry exported on a single page by itself rather than several entries on one page. Not useful. What a waist of a pro-subscription. I wish I could get my money back. But I did manage to cancel my subscription going forward. Word to the wise try before you buy. The Windows version of that application was worse than the android app. Did you see the devs response? Laughable. 😂 Refund = better review $"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is easy to use and good for people who are new to journalling (like me), but premium is expensive. I think it said $16.99 a year but I may be wrong about that. The app serves its function well without premium. Overall highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app. simple yet fulfilling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A very cool app! The ads are a bit annoying but well there is a premium version. Suggestion: a shared feature would be great so two people can contribute to the same diary!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. So easy to use and keep track of things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like it but tired of being asked to subscribe, moving to less instrusive app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"they now charge money for this app. really bad for people on a low income. But good for the developers they get greedy. sad but true. and now the developers want me to edit my review and to acknowledge their hard work. it's still all about greed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app, but i forgot my passpord now, i cannot enter it anymore"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A real companion."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awsome experience"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to note down your thoughts etc. Each note is saved with the time and date and more information such as mood, location etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the perfect app for the purpose of maintaining a journal on phone. I don't see myself switching to another journal app anytime soon! :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.. i really love to note down my importants things and random thoughts in this app. Its like my diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"superb app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love that I can attach videos and pictures to my journal so that I have a reference for what has happened. It would be good if the app didn't keep reminding me to rate it. I also wish the stickers work better. For some reason, it always becomes a new entry on its own. Other than those, it is a joy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app with sync functionality. Loved it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep and use regularly. I'm definitely getting better at putting in the time to regularly write. I've set a reminder to prompt me to write and it totally works. I love the simplicity of this app. I love that the app has functionality to look back and I can read what I wrote a year ago, i.e., this ""memory lane"" is awesome. I must say that majority of the time, I use the app to jot down things I'm grateful for, new things I learned, or new people I've met. Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I realized that they had taken everything out of my account. Within hours, I emailed them requesting a refund, as the app had already been deleted from my phone prior to the money being taken. I have yet to hear back from anyone. Unprofessional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keeps my thoughts organized better than loose paper ever could."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really good app. it helps me a lot."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very neat app for keeping journal entries in an easy to recover form."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hi, will the throwback option shows everyday report with a view of yesterday, last week the same day, last month the same day , last year and the years before for the same day or is it only occasional for any special moments?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i really love this app. it gets a 4 out of 5 because it too frequently asks for you to upgrade to premuim. Other than that, its perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use app with a good PC interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It do what it do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this program helps make journing easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is a great app. it works cross platform (though I've only tried web and Android)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I got locked out of my account. I didn't sync it. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Very helpful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"good app but too many popups .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app to document the things that I want to remember. It's a really pretty UI. The challenge is remembering and taking the time to record all the good things. Utilize the reminder feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself works fine, but when i try to save a journal entry and put in my password for some reason it forces me to an intrusive ad offering a deal on their subscription. I'm not paying a monthly subscription to a journal app that should be free. I dont pay any more money besides the cost of the paper to write in a physical journal, so why should I do that with this? Stop intrudong with your crummy deals. I'm not buying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ease of use and app as whole!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Like the app, but it doesn't properly rotate when I turn my tablet or dock it with keyboard. Which is terrible since it's meant for blogging. unless I use the swipe keyboard, I have to type sideways. Just aweful, rotation is a basic function, c'mon people. EDIT: For real Dev? Did you acutally read my review!?! I SAID TABLET. I narrowed it down. It fails to rotate if you are in another app when it rotates, then return to this one. It's like it doesn't check the rotation when you come back."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I needed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The offer to upgrade is really obtrusive. I've tried it twice and must have been offered to upgrade a dozen times. Technically, I cannot use my S Pen. I will write an entry to have it crash and force me to restart. i cannot commit to purchase it, if I cannot use the tools inherent to my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's nice at first glance. Still evaluating. A bit irritating though, to see all those popups to upgrade to premium plan repeatedly all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey serves my purpose for me when I don't have pen and paper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic journal/diary app. the free version has way too many ""offers"" would be nice to have the option to dismiss those for good. other than that very good. haven't tried sync with pic... maybe someday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Lots of advertising and paid pop ups"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I get reminders every day to record in my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good one for me. very helpfull."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's a good app. Helping me capture end of day thoughts which is what I needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. Using it as my diary for couple of years. Used it (infrequently) to post on the Blog also."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works pretty well. I have the annual subscibtion that deal with cross platform. So far so good. Just waiting for the integration with other apps, maybe documenting Mood which I am already using Daylio, so if both of it can sync together and provide a helpful stats, that will be pretty cool. Other than that it's a solid app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app for creating a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app for well over a year now and it's become a part of my daily routine. My only complaint is ever since I switched phones the app occasionally stopped sending me daily reminders. I sent a complaint and while customer support are quick to respond, they were unable to fix this issue and now I just use the phone's alarm so I don't miss a day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"can you guys drop the premium price .please"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is encouraging me to track my exercise program every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like it so far!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple interface without annoying ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it, planning to purchase the full version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good Application for Daily use !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"could have had more features but it's great app for journeying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Monthly Fee. It looks like a good app, however, I'm not even going to get used to it when I know I won't pay the fees and not be able to keep using it in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!. Makes it easy to keep a Journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. easy to use"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love being able to journal on point!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So this is really helping! I normally allow thoughts to go round,round and round in my head. I can get write it down in the app and it helps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of my regular diary apps.... I alternate between this, diario, and day one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and edit. An app that enhances the value of your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good, but still room for improvement; would be great if you could insert hyperlinks in the text (I.e. underneath a word), as well as improved formatting (bold, underline, strike through) in the text as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"largest font size is unseeable. pop uos after you pay for it. used to be great, it's getting bloated."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"用了很久了，很不错。"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use to note daily life events. This is a really good way to keep memories alive and I'm really impressive enough to buy premium edition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great easy app to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is great, by i have problem with sinc B0501 error and i have it for weeks. Tried to wright about it in ""help"" but page doesn't load from wifi or mobile network."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well, but has an annoying bug where playing the audio will be stopped by the screen turning off. Also needs to support multiple audio clips per entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very cool app user friendly and great for use with no bugs till now and also with some cool features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it and have used it for some time. Thanks for doing suck good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is very good diary app. But the new update of place picker is sucks* 😖, I prefer the old one. * = the map doesn't have current location feature, no tag on map, search is pointless, & no photo on selected place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nice app.worth a download.i dont use it that much,but probably those who need apps like this...this one is quite nice. try it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite and most used app by far. I cannot recommend Journey highly enough to anyone looking for flexible mobile journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ive enjoyed it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great functionality but constant ads for premium paid version get old pretty quick."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome Journal app. I love writing in this journal app and it allows me to capture my day. I upgraded to the subscription app as it allows me to enter or edit entries from right my phone or my PC. I can also export my entries to a PDF is I need to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a great app, never had any problems!! It's everything i needed and wanted!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have forgotten my pass code. How do i access the app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the app, its help with journaling my thoughts and lessons"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, does everything I need and more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"easy to use but requires subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Still love it. Secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app! Just used over one week and brought the Lifetime Plan, which is amazing and rare, not so many companies does that. I can keep track of what's going on my days and life, upload images, write about everything, it's really an excellent app. Congrats for all the people who are supporting this app! Good job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I keep a note daily of my activity. usually dictate by voice. very happy with the app. I just hope it'll be saved in perpetuity!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Still going ok.. I bought on Android. Should I pay again on my Apple?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app used for several years and continually suprised by flexibility. thanks"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A Good Journaling app. Enjoy using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best diary app. everyone should try."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been using Journey for a while now, and I have to say it's quite lovely. UI is unobtrusive to writing. I love the atlas features. I love the use of markdown! The daily notification to write is handy to have. As are the inspirations! Pricing is fair. My only negative is the fact you can't re-arrange photos in an entry after they've been added. Sometimes I'd rather a different photo for a cover photo for the entry!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loving the app atm"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the app developer lacks the imagination/skills to solve the problem of paid version/premium users of the app that uses different email accounts in purchasing and in logging in the app. because of this, there is a pop up asking the premium user to buy the app again and again. buy at your own risk. the app developer is satisfied after taking your money since premium/paid users are already captured market"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this! I write in it multiple times a day, very easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can't import data, app is stuck on ""Pick file to import"""
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. so easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of those apps that continously gets better and better and finds new ways to give users more functionality and value. Thank you, Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i sooo love this app 💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just started to use it. And many times changed mobile and got 90% of all synced entries. So I am falling in love with it.... 😍😍😍😍 Team, can we add something like sticky notes to be kept on homescreen as in PC we have it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've had the app for a while. But haven't used it consistently. the free version works fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"soon after I have a journey with it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for months. Best Journaling app! Easy to use. Nice to customize. Can add photos too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's fun and I've been using it for months now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"helpful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Overall very good, but the new place picker lets it down. Suddenly I can't select places that absolutely exist, and which used to exist in the place picker just a few days ago. This is very much a backwards step."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"you really need to fix those multiple accounts issue i have bought lifetime premium in my main account and even though i uninstalled and installed it still goes to primary account i feel dumb after paying and not able to use it kindly fix it plz i absolutely love the app though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Gute App. Mich mit UX anti pattern zu bombardieren bewegt mich allerdings nicht zum Kauf eines Abos. Eher im Gegenteil: Ich finde es nervig und unseriös."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Easy to add entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far liking the app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My wife asks: What did you do yesterday? With my memory, this app certainly helps."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent & convenient way to keep a journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app delivers what i need/want in a journal: a visually pleasing place to write notes/entries, it can add/update my location and time, it offers image or file attachments-which i love! the only thing i don't like is the upgrade prompts- i think they pop up too often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not free. Offered a 7 day trial then it charges monthly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fine, useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really smart journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app, irratically, for years. It's a loyal writing tool with good addons. eg voice notes, photos and sketches. Must be the tool for all writers on the move!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have health issues. It's helped me to look back , and see my physical state on a week to week basis. Then use the information to help correct bad habits as well as give my doctors more detailed information on each visit. Then they make adjustments to my treatment plans."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"After a year of using the app, I realised it has many great features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"as much as we overshare, in this day and age, there are some things you have to say/write/yell into the void. Journaling across my different devices has really helped my mental health, and is just what I need to get the weight off my chest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for Journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One thing that could make it better: don't go to kick screen after completing entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's so easy to journal our family's activities and adventures. I scrapbook (ProjectLife) and want and need everything documented. I love how I can quickly take note of something the kids have said or my own personal thoughts. I use my tablet and keyboard and my cell phone (speech to text) for quick entries; both sync beautifully."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best simple tool to record exciting and significant happenings with record of location, photo of event, etc. since i like to keep the write up clean, the design of the apps reinforce that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like how you can journal by date and tag accordingly. The only thing that bothers me is that it keeps asking me to upgrade. Other than that, great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! It's a good way to keep tract of your moods and goals! Also, a good way to stop snoopers from snooping!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They took money out my account after I deactivated my profile and uninstalled the app. I submitted a request for my money back with no response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very grateful for this app. Makes journalling so much easier. I have tried to journal for years.. it never stuck. With this, having it at my fingertips, I am able to journal and document some very important, special, and even hard times. Thanks Journey. You've got a life long customer for sure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journaling App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I can journal any time, even when I am away from book journal and pen! The features are easy to use and the layout is nice and clean. I am glad I decided to download it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Year in pixels please 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love the app, but the ads and upgrade offers are annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💙 journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Highly useful journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Made journal writing much more easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Had high hopes for this sp but it didn't offer as much functionality Daylio; overview, reminders etc. I was pretty turned off by the push to upgrade before I had a chance to assess the product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the apps I use most! Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"the app is nice, currently the most advanced on android. availability on all platforms. also great: audio notes, it doesn't use it's own cloud space for security reasons. things to improve: - better tag search: an autocomplete mode in the search filtering specific tags. - text templates for success journals, gratitude journal...) - better audio: it should be instantly playable, no extra window, multiple audios per entry - pictures and audio in the same post is a must.currently audio is useless"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app, the only thing i would change os to stop the constant pop ups for the upgrade it is pretty annoying when all you want to do is write real quick."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a fantastic journaling app -- love the ui and features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good. But cannot purchase to become prime member."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Honestly I would give this app 5 stars, but theres one glaring problem. I'm constantly annoyed with notifications and pop ups to buy a premium version. I can't even open the app without having to close 2 seperate pop ups with some offer. Developers need to understand that constantly begging me to buy a product makes me want to buy it even less. If I see any changes to this, I'll change my review to 5 stars. And I won't be changing it if I just get an automated ""thanks for your feedback"" response."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great so far. just what i need to record daily activities for work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it. It backs up my entries so I can access them anytime on any device. Automatically puts the date and time. Tags help me organize certain entries 🙂. Love the design and neatness. No ads. The lock feature needs adjusting. It locks me out after I put a new entry?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you for creating a great app! Use it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its great. simple, easy to use. isnt loaded with a bunch of features you never use. if you just want to jot down thoughts or keep a basic record of things, this is the app to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good for what i need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great to wake up with. Helpful in keeping up with upcoming dates and able to notify myself with alarms and notes. Motivational and inspirational quotes of the day is also a useful tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's OK but the ads are annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app does just what is expected of a daily journal yet is consistently improved through updates. The journal provides a simple but appealing interface to record thoughts and events with tags, location, photos and files. And tech support is responsive to suggestions and feedback. Oh, and the software is multi-platform too, without being browser based. There are real applications for major OS platforms. What more can you ask for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Do what supposed to do, and that is more than I can ask for..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i like to write ....i mean journal but i cant always get to mines , so this app is super perfect for me and i can use pics !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Would have been a better experience if the constant stream of ads didn't pop up every single time I logged in or did something. I don't care for the export function. Back up save via Google or something."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app, perfect for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love love love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I can dig the interface, especially the tags, but the sync across platforms is only if you premium up. Same for all the other quality of life features. If I could log in to the web browser and see my past posts I would rate higher and pay for it. Otherwise I can't tell if it actually works."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm not much of a journal person but having this app helps me jot down how I'm feeling when I need to. It has helped me a lot duing these past 4 yrs dealing with grief & depression."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used to write a lot on this app, I signed up using my outlook account but after changing my phone I can't login again to that account. please help me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ff7 was best final fantasy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to understand and operate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Using it to track what I eat and when, pictures help to remember it too so it makes me more self aware. Nice design, easy to use. Only thing I don't like is its self promotion to upgrade. It's constantly popping up. It pops up when you open it, when you make an entry, not up mention there's an ad bar on the bottom of the screen. I like the app but I refuse to upgrade because their ads annoyed me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Love the app. Use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I install multifuel fires for a living and I have to keep records of each job. I am not sure the developer has realised the potential of this app for my type of work but I can tell you this app is amazing. I can keep a record of everything so easily. Pictures and wording with a great search facility. It works faultlessly and saves me a fortune in time and ink. I have binned my paper diary because the app synks across my other devices so the chance of loosing my data is virtually zero."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app because it lets me record information simply. currently I'm using it to keep scripts for emails and messaging. i also keep ideas and notes. it's very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this is an amazing app.....which help me to share all my grief to it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it for Gratitude and Visualization instrument."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good but really? 50 percent off limited offer. An hour later 20 percent off. Yet later no offer and it's always the same price. Good app but way too many pop ups for purchase. It's not needed. Most if the things I buy, I buy them because of the quality of the app, and i still may yet do. Shame, otherwise a very useful and good journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app but I don't care for the pay for better features ad."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"journey is a fabulous diary it is even more fabulous when you use it on a regular basis. No excuses for not documenting your life. And let's face it in today's world documenting your life on a private basis is a damn good thing. My Hope and prayer is that men women and children like use this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app gives me the opportunity to capture my memories in an easy and accessible manner. It meets all expectations! Would highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great solution 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I like this app. I paid a lot for it by app standards and was greatly disappointed to discover there is also a subscription model. For the price, I expected a fully functioning app. Responding to the developer: your pricing absolutely wasn't clear to me. Way to blame the victim!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Real good features, even in the free version the features available are satisfactory. And best this is it syncs over devices using the google account. now thats precious to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank you for the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Solid journal app. Been using on and off over a couple years but it is a good system."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app keeps account of daily activities"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful and very helpful app to orderly collect my thoughts and emotions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"features:instant sync, beautiful UI, insertions size: should be compressed. in-app purchase : to unlock all features and the reason behind my 4 stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super easy to use and useful. ive definitely journaled much more since using it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"just started, seems ok. would like to be able to search within a journal entry when editing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used to use Flava but that app/company died off. This is now my go to, love the dark mode"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I video track my moods and check in every night with my bipolar it really makes it easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent. plannung to buy paid version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app. it goes across all devoces and if i dont journal i can still access all my old journals from before. to see where i was at the time. i can also journal anywhere which is such a great feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Spammy but very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"just what I needed, simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"use this daily. I find it very helpful to get things off my chest by writing them down and looking back at past entries is always interesting. Been using the free version for a few years now, tempted by the upgrade but still a bit expensive, maybe if it was £10? Still the free one is fab!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"well-designed. easy to use. meets my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for doing quick entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"10 stars app! Excelent 👌! It is not enough 5 stars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome , simple to use app and great ui"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is both syncing to my desktop and phone for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Easy to use. The app serves an important purpose. However, formatting text functionally with Markdown language, is not user friendly, is limited and needs improvement. Not everyone needs Markdown language. Regular formatting such as font colours, bullet points, number lists, bold, italic and underline functions would be more useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its a great journal app! I love thatit allows me to make a picture journal, a video journal and a written journal all in one. i like how i can write entries days after the said date. its very easy to use. it also keeps my entries private. 10/10 recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"很好用，使用起來很順手"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a great app. I recommend it to everyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have the add free version and I am quite happy with it. No problems."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I wish there was a spell check option. is there any way to fix this??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to make journal entries wherever I am. Easy to attach pictures and edit entries. Pretty good voice recognition for dictating entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is really easy to use. I like the features that allow you to look at the photos all together, and the map that shows where photos were taken over time. One feature I would like is to be able to download just the photos only into a separate file so that then I could print them out separately so I can file the best 365 photos of the year in a physical album, and download text separately. I do like the pdf download though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this every day and find it very easy to use. If you save photos as I do it does take up a lot of space on my phone but it's backed up on the laptop. I suppose it could usefully link with my calendar but it's not essential."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good way to keep a journal and handier than carrying a book and pen around - after all we've always got phone or laptop around when travelling. Easy to upload photos and I like the facility for backdating entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great Journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Great for writing, if you don't like using all the other features. They had a 7 day free trial for their membership to use all the extra special features. the special features did not work. And before the money was taken out of my account I contacted them to try and cancel my membership that was on the 3rd of February it's now the 11th And still no response to when and if i will get my refund for 14.99 Pretty expensive monthly charge for the app not working totally correctly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"app is great but please give users the option to zoom in or make the word font bigger because the words right now when typed are a little too small. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"bc google owns it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is similar to a journal for me to record down ideas and readings from my tarot cards and oracle cards. I can go back to read previous posts and photos as reminders of the things I need to know and do. I bought the lifetime premium, which has a few features that are supportive and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! allows me to journal anywhere @ anytime. sends me reminders of past entries on the same date in previous years which allows me to see & aporciate the changes & growth I've experienced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good! Finally a journal that's easy to write in frequently, carry around, and keep private. I recommend buying the lifetime premium if you'll use it lots. Nighttime mode is always easy on the eyes and it's nice to attach several pictures. con: you can't have several journals. DEVELOPER SUGGESTION: Please allow us to select from more moods! ie between happy and indifferent. The feature's useless unless it can reflect how we feel. ALSO let us have a password on the desktop version!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth buying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple to use . All good so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love that I can record my thoughts and ideas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice journaling app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Disappointed. Can't import diaro to here."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"suits my needs perfectly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this! So easy to keep journal everyday and helped me alot to revisit a day on my journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is very feature rich and provides an excellent means of expressing the myriad of jumbled thoughts that tend to rattle around in my head in a way that provides a clean, organized and asthetically pleasing format. i have been a long time user of this program and cannot speak highly enough regarding the quality of work done by the team developing this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for more than last 1.5 years. Nice app. But its a matter of regret that, now a days the app is showing too much advertisement to purchase its premium version. Its so much annoying and wasting both of my mood and time. Now i am searching for alternate option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful as a digital diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have enjoyed the ease of this app. Good quality app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal - this journal is great. I've used it for the past few years. It allows you to attach a photo each day to remind you about the fun you had on your ""adventure"".."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app's having rich functionality."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb journal app with excellent features and ease of use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use, great interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app it's so handy. I used to journal in an actual book but my lifestyle is so hectic I don't get time anymore, so this is ideal! Highly recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app but incessantly bugs you to buy a subscription which completely ruins it. There are smarter, less intrusive ways to monetize an app like this that aren't going to drive away your users."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pure Brilliance, my absolute favorite app. Easy to use and all round the best platform I've used!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app ,easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"stop request ing higher rating"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the clean look of the entries and love the image thumbnails and preview entries on the calendar page. If this had a mood calendar like Universal Diary, and dated the photos in the media section like PopDiary, I'd definitely pay for the upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Quite easy to use. I will appreciate if I can bold my headings"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice!!!!!! Best journal I could find. 5 stars worth it for quick and easy daily journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"glory be to Allah Subhanu wa' tala"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"helps my depression and anxiety. it take how i feel and gives it physical form. i dont know why it helps but it does"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice and worth buying premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Litty mctitty"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"At first I loved this app. I was looking for a journaling app that I could write in and keep it locked. I thought it was secure until my husband got into it without much effort, even though I had it password protected. All he had to do was uninstall the app then reinstall it. Once it was reinstalled, he got into it because there was no longer a password needed. He just opened it right up and deleted a bunch of pictures and God knows what else?!! So thanks alot for making such a ""secure"" app! 😡😡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great journaling app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its easy to use and I really enjoy it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good App but very bad about not using across platform. Buying premium license through android but it cannot be applied to web version.😞😕😟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They never even bothered answer my support request and their video size capability renders it non functional."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent way of journaling. Diary writing was not so easy till I find this app. Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"works will enough, but getting too pushy about upgrading"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it makes you pay to keep a journal when other apps do it for free. Also, its very deceptive to offer a free app and then as soon as you open it, you are asked to pay $50 annually. Thanks but no thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful planning App."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this...makes remembering life ez"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, clean layout, syncs history to save entries across devices if synced with Google account. I wish it didn't constantly have pop-ups for ""sales"" on premium membership but it's bearable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thanks great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like that you can add photos but am still getting used to having a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use platform, free fo use, not necessarily need to subscribe."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent way to keep track of my ups, downs, and progress."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great that the app integrates across platforms"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so many options! write add pics whatever you want it's free and so amazing and password protected this is what you're looking for in a journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it helps clear the clutter. lol."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very happy to come across this app. Liked as its synchronizable in all devices. Should be made available for microsft app too. Liking it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app to keep track on ur daily activities"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Money was taken out of my account and i am not impressed. FREE TRIAL? and then $50 was taken out. Very disappointed as i love using this app. i want my money back!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's simple. it works. i like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"很棒！希望能有跟其他帳號共享一份地圖日記的功能"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been journaling for years with journey...so, it's always with me wherever I go, and whenever I was!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"paid for premium and it's worth it for the dark theme alone! definitely the most gorgeous implementation of dark mode I've ever seen. i do enjoy writing down my thoughts in it. the app is so well designed it's an absolute joy. i love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's OK, simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"absolutely invaluable, I don't know how many journals I've made over the years. I find this so user friendly. its fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"rất hay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I appreciate being able to write out my thoughts. Its very soothing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I use it every morning."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been exactly what I've been looking for. I'm using it to track my health as opposed to just straight journaling. I use it along with voice input to make it easy to track water intake, what foods I'm eating, headaches, and other issues. It takes care of tracking the date and the time and the location. It also allows me to tag each entry so later I can pull all of my entries about water, for instance, if I want to see how much I've drunk in a day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect. Been using daily for 3 years and plan on using it forever. In fact, I'm writing this review to do my part to help ensure the app sticks around until I retire 30 years from now, lol. Everything you could want between photos, tagging, location, searchability, etc. Managed in the cloud and seamless across platforms. If you want to start journaling THIS is is the app to get."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for capturing memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely the best Journaling app, solely because of it's cross-platform and syncing ability. I also love that I can attach pictures and files to my entries. Does what it's supposed to do! You just have to purchase each version for Android and iOS. Having the free web version is great too for times when I am using my laptop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it as a gratitude journal and to write my thoughts and ideas. It also helps me vent my frustrations from time to time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app. can be used without needing to purchase anything although i get asked every time i open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app simple layout usefull app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love this app. it is my cobsolidation point of so many things i could hardly keep vtrack. all my Journaling and pics and files and lists and I'm ONLY just beginning to learn the App. 💙💙💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"replaced the paper and pens thankfully"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've always wanted to journal and this app makes it so effortless, spend the money to be able to add photos and videos! *UPDATE* After using this app daily for four months the app size grew to 1.19GB! i had to delete it from my phone and try using the cloud feature, but the cloud doesn't give me access to my membership benefits to add photos. Customer service has been ignoring my emails requesting help. If the cloud can't support membership benefits I will need to find a new journaling app☹️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the fact that I can search my notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like to journal. For now, I only use it for keeping track of my exercise on a daily basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have been using this for years now..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best Journaling app, although expensive for the PC version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had diary for over one year. It's a good journey. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very convenient as it automatically notes down the date and time needed for my journal. however the constant pop up of telling me to upgrade is annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very user friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good. But wish you could add more photos per day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is very good. Adding different font colors and more formatting tools would really make it much better app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"lively bed of memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app if you like to journal digitally. Simple, easy to use, clean design with little distractions. I'm a new user. Looking forward to discovering all features that come with the subscription. Started w/ free trial. After 2 days subscribed. Wish I could go back to add photos to my previous entiries. This feature was not available on free trial version which was one reason I purchased. I really wanted to add a photo to my first entry.😒 I'm a bit OCD with my digital journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I received an email from Google where it tells me your app through Google+ has been taken data that shouldn't be allowed to take, and your developers had for 6 days data like: my email address, partial birthday, place information , language. I hope you are aware of it. I don't feel confident anymore in. using your app honestly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had this app for one month and it's the best one so far . I tried loads. No silly ads, can write in day or night. Quick to update , love the idea of saving pictures and videos especially when you are writing about your day. A picture says a thousand words"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app. It would be great if under the calender view I am allowed to slide freely among each day jounal. Now I have to exit the detailed page and return to the calendar, then manually select next day's date. It's not convenient at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best app for personal private diary I found so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"lovely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"قابل استعمال اور فائدے کی چیز ہے!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always wanted to journal but always felt kinda cheesy putting my thoughts on paper and expected myself to try to write something profound every time. this app has brought it into a much less formal light; with an ease similar to posting on social media or sending a text, I'm able to write my thoughts out and derive the benefits I hope for from a journal without putting such pressure on myself. my paper journal has also become more meaningful and easy to use since I started using this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent dairy app with all required options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was loving this app and had approximately 100 notes. Well my phone crashed and I lost everything. Wrote to see if there was anyway to get my notes back and get these answers which make no sense. They are not in my Google Drive either. Lost !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"superb diary! all in one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helping me to realize and record the blessings in my life each day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"испортили. слишком навязчиво и часто предлагает оформить подписку"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Although used only 1 mth now seems a very good jnl app. I have used a diff, well rated, jnl for yrs but this app is more flexible and better designed. Easy to update quickly then go back to when you have more time to expand the content. The tags are a great feature to help 'filter' lookups. The tool bar inserts are quick and very helpful. The output options for export and print look good but yet to use. Only con is even after purch still bombarded with req to 'subscribe'. Stop that!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its very easy to use and it also recovers the old data if one reinstalled the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"this app looks pretty but before you can try it it makes you subscribe for a year at $30 per year with 7 days free. nowhere in its settings or help does it explain how to cancel subscription. i had to google it and found that you need 48 hours before billing starts to cancel it. no thanks. seems like a money grabbing business model, a classic subscription service with automatic payments thats tough to get rid of."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great UI. Easy to use. Tagging your Journal entry feature is really good. This can be handy to find your similar tagged entries. Desktop entry is good but loads entire journal which should be selectable range of dates other wise it will load lots of data when journal is old having many entries with media. Overall fine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"using it from long time, its just owsome & save purpose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if you want a diary or a journal, this is the perfect one. period. i like the option that you can compose via email."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the experience is nice on mobile..i hope it could be improved on desktop.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good app. Clear, easy to use and great to look at it to have track of ideas, memories and anything you want to keep inside."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the apps... but can you cut down the price a bit xD"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I journal almost every day. This is helpful because it has a password that you create."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if you need someplace to write this is it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Type too small to read. No option to make it bigger."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app but it wont let me just rate it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good. It's great I can go back and read old entries. Strongly recommend adding a mood chart to this app to monitor moods along with your entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is about the best thing next to a physical journal, if not better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"enjoying this little app and find it useful to jot down some quick memories or my time out and a out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Not free, just a 7 day free trial"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A decent and easy to use app with good UI to jolt down your day of life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I really like this app and have had it since March 2018 and I would rate it higher but in the recent months everytime i open the app or close out of writing an entry it trys to offer me premium membership deals and i do not want them and would like to know if theres a way to turn this off? it's gotten v annoying"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I don't always have time to journal in my physical Journal so it's nice to use voice to text and just say how I'm feeling or even when I do have time just type it out on here and being able to look back so easily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is all about!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really cool and well set out personal journal which allows you to create a daily insert of life and spiritual experiences, bitching, epiphiny, new ideals quests advice write about any type of topic as each day takes you and it also gives a overall insight to how the path of time over the months and year has treated you your mood during that time and explores many other personally interesting add ons to make this journal a journey that is unique"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall I love this journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything I ever wanted in a journaling app. Starting with easy mood logging, geotagging, photos.... Based on geotag, automatically calcs weather for that day. Can't wait to use it for a year, so it shows me what I was doing on that day a year ago. Just a ton of features in a slick package. Now I just need to remember to update it....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Used to be a nice journal app, until it started bugging me to pay for premium every single day - even sending push notifications to do so. Not ok. Uninstalled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A simple and elegant journal to chronicle your moments."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been a useful app for having a quick note taking across many platforms, it's designed for phones, but it is accessible through desktop"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It does what I need it to do. I'm satisfied."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm in love with this app. 💜 Thank you! More power! 👏🏻💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well particularly with Google Voice which makes diary entry exceptionally easy and convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Write. Write. Write!! Best journal app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it so far. give it a try!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"awesome app.. it has tons of my memories... and nostalgia is now everyday thing for me.. 😀 but 4 stars just because it doesn't take location accurately.. don't know why"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"if paid the premuim, it should've been accessible with other devices other than andriod"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"in combination with Google keyboard speech to text I can easily keep journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use, but not much different features for premium and non premium. i hope we can use template in phone app too. and it will be nice if you also add activities tracker like habits and goals everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it a lot. The only thing that's missing for me is the syntax highlighting support for markdown. Would this be possible in the future?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i find the app handy to record thoughts and feelings. going to use the hash tags more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Tried this app it was pretty average. Some of the staff are pretty bad. One of which threatened legal action due to a comment that was said."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app is great, however, I only need a basic journal app and I'm not interested in paying for the extra features, as great as they may be. And because of that, you feel the need to try and annoy me into paying for the premium services with 1-3 pop ups in a row, every time I access the app, save a new entry, edit an entry, or do pretty much anything in the app. I am really close to looking for another option. Please allow those suggestions to be turned off!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I would love this app if most everything you need to customize it didn't require a membership and do expensive. Paying almost $3.00 a month or $11.00 for lifetime is to much for what's offered."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to import data fron Diaro"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the reminders. I haven't had any problems with the app so far, I paid for it because I like that simple it was and it didn't cost that much. I really appreciate the work the developers put into this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app! With the app, I have no excuse but to record my thoughts and impressions. This recorded record is a great blessing to me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of things that happened to me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"one of the better journalling apps. wish yiu could add to it via google home, or can you?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App for Journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Night Mode hidden behind a paywall is absolutely unfair. It's part of a basic UI. I am not going to use this app, free, free trial, or otherwise. I was actually looking forward to using this app, but for some people Night Mode is essential, I guess."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app is just what I need to voice my feelings and my life do it and then I don't have to go off on anybody and just be a normal person I love this app so I can have it in my heart and my soul so I can air out everything and have peace I thank God for it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's good and capture s data nice and neat"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am totally enjoying the app, excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using the app for about a year now,but one thing is missing, yes i can export my staff into pdf, but we would also like to import pdf or word files. like save pdf files.calould please add that feature"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is very nice aap who love to write.well organized and easy to use but i would like to mention there is always a popup pay to get upgraded.I think it should not be pop-up every time , if someone needs to upgrade definitely they will purchase . its making irritating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"gives a secret place to vent..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"like the app. wish there were more free options and could attach more pictures to each day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it's good but please reduce the pop up advertisement to buy the product..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"i just downloaded another journal which had night mode for free so"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I used for keeping journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very organized means of journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use and very adaptable to photos and videos etc. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. After a year on my phone, decided to upgrade and add it to my other devices (ios). My favorite feature is the automatic recording of temp and weather. Very helpful when I review my apiary and garden inspection pics and notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent. very very smooth animations and the black theme looks very nice. have been using it for over a year and decided to pay for the premium. thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this Journaling app! It has a very clean & easy interface. It has a multitude of useful features. About the only thing it doesn't have that would be useful would be encryption in storage & a template option, in case one would like specific questions to answer in a journal entry. That would be why I would give it 4 stars instead of 5 but it is very close to perfect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good... To keep up your own stories and journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice concept, nice design, nicely executed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly, Simple Design, No limit on storage. Nice and very good to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, provides a decent service and has a nice layout overall, only missing an important option and maybe a separate page for longterm events, plans, ideas and even fiction, I'd just recommend storing it based off the title instead of date, nothing complex."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i just dont like the ads and constant upgrade encouragements."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the way this app can change the time and place when uploading photo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"google assistant integration not working? i used to be able to take a quick note and have it write to journey but it hasnt worked recently and instead takes a note in google app:("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app so much I paid the small price to upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"looks like a free app but actually costs money every month."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i didnt fully appreciate the value and power this app affords till i developed a desire to remember who i've been, be comfortable with who i am and aspire to who i will become."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Would be nice if a Note taking app include in it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for. Easy to use. Quick to launch. More features if I want them. Good backup. Good security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i can't comment on the app itself as I haven't installed or used it. But I point out a contridiction in their product description... I take issue with claiming that it will ""last forever!"" The Cloud is a concept Ostensibly offered by companies like Microsoft and Google for storing and maintaining personal, valuable data. I bought a Seagate/Maxtor drive years ago that soon died. they wanted THOU$AND$ to retrieve my data. I'll NEVER buy a Seagate/Maxtor product again! OR USE THE CLOUD!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app, but the location tracking is kinda bad. It makes the app quite sluggish when you want to quickly log something."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"It's a great app for journalling, but the ads for buying premium everytimevis getting irritating. Would have given dude stars of not for the constant ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice. Functional and pretty. Missing star for inability to make entries on back dates."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice and useful app! 👍😊💕"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app works great. It does exactly what you want for a basic journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"De las mejores App de este tipo, muy completa e intiutiva. recomendada."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Immediately upon opening the app it started nagging me to buy. I'd love to have been able to try it first. If you intend this to be a paid app please charge to install it in the first place."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very handy app. works perfectly every time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply stands apart from the rest.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"meh.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App for Daily writing. Can add Life Goals feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"$46 a year is too much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great options for adding g photos, videos, tags, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal app, this is the one to use, accurate and a time saver, no more writing in a journal that gets misplaced."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this Journey: Diary, Journal App. I like the different options on what you can add or not to each entry. 🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the fact that I can go to a past day & add to it! Sometimes I don't put things down until I remember & that's happened a couple times and it's usually the next day... LOL... I have found out how to do it and I am very satisfied with this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great for a daily diary for your life events."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent and useful, to say briefly. But, Journey has become a part of my Life's Journey. The app is beautiful and that iself is an incentive for Journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I made contact in November but no-one wants to help. I paid for the upgrade but you applied my PayPal account to the wrong email I registered Journey with. I need you to change this please !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Synch with your PC using google drive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a really great app for storing memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"app works fine, but I was put off by the pushy sales tactics trying to get you to upgrade. ""50% off for this one time only!!"". Only to get the message twice more in a few days... Lost all my respect when they went against what they were saying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"question: please, after the 14days free trial, if i couldn't pay money, can't i still be able to use this application? edit: what are the features that are under ""in-app"" purchase?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"LOVE this app. but it lacks the ability to add tags to entries and to search them by tags. would really like to compartmentalize and look back on entries with the help of tags and full search. feature. implement that and I will bump my rating up to 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has met and exceeded all of my expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I loved this app very much. Thank you very much for your new update. This is what I was looking for. I really appreciate this update. Thanks again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"pop ups the moment the app is opened. not everyone can afford paid app. I'm fine with adds somewhere else in the app, but I that I have to tap 2x to remove app where they ask me to pay. devs refused to do anything about that. used to be a big supporter of the app, but I found the devs rude."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like being able to use talk to text for my journaling. it's quick and convenient. i also like the simple layout of the free version. I wish they wouldn't hound me so much about upgrading to the yearly subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank u. very helpful in keeping my notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app interface. It's easy to see the multiple entries and you can see the calendar at the same time. I would gladly buy this app if it give us the opportunity to put multiple picture per entry, because this is a must for me. update: Journey now support up to 10 pictures per post since a while. Thank you for taking suggestion into account. It is now my only digital diary I'm using."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best in its kind of apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"too early to say but I am using this to replace my diary and so far find this app easy to use and sufficient for my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Maybe it's a good app, but the constant nagging to upgrade to the pro version or subscribe didn't make me want to stick around to find out. Notifications, emails, in app pop ups and banners. Even as soon as you open it for the first time. Come on, can I at least try it 5 minutes? Very unprofessional. Uninstalled EDIT: The developer replies to my review and and continues insisting I buy the app. Incredible. BTW I had 0 entries on the journal, since it barely lets you use it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please let us disable the activity feature altogether. Please."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best app for saving memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"please allow export for the free version. I feel hijacked by the app since I cannot export my notes for my own use without paying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. So good to keep a track of life's little journeys"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey is really useful app with lots of feature.. Probably this is the best in class but the problem is with its annoying POPUPS.. It's always force you to get premium version or membership plan which is really really frustration... This thing should be improved asap."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Overall Best Diary App Of All Time!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app allows me to enter special notes about the day in a quick and easy manner."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful app to record your experiences of each day. I have started using it evey night to reflect on my day before I call it a day :)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its not perfect, but its the best you'll find for the app store."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Journey is hands down the best app of its kind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super cool😎 app for daily journal.. tracking mood and activities.. i love it.. i wish I could give you 100 stars 🌟.. thank you so much.. love you journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"gud"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Greatt! Also if we can be able to update/rename tags it would really be awesome! 4 stars for now for this tag update, or is there any way to dothat? EDIT: Thanks Journey for the response. But how about if i wanted to rename a tag that has been used in multiple entries?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Sir, I have made payment for premium service and still payment. Is not updated. Kindly look into the matter. I have already recieve d confirmation but still app notifies for payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Where the hell is it stored in Google drive? I can't find it backed up anywhere! If it doesn't save why would i waste my time writing anything?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like it. That's a lot coming from me because I'm ultra skeptical when it comes to new apps, especially ones in which you share your randoms of the day. im also looking forward to joining their premium dealio. Journey is no-nonsense, easy to use and nonconfrontational. (yes, an app can be that!) Have fun on your journey! (yes, I'm a corny & care not)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use. I love being able to add the date and time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"let's me Express myself and see what I have accomplish from year to year. This app is awesome and the best one for me❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simplistic, got all the necessary features in it. This is perfect :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Initially great. Then when my Google Drive was full, it stopped syncing. Fine, but then I couldn't retrieve my previous entries! Almost 20GB worth of material! I'm still waiting to hear back from them."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the simplicity of this app! I pick a picture or two and write a couple of lines and I'm done!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love how fluid I can be with my journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Initially, I was very happy with this app and so paid for the premium version. My enjoyment has been spoiled since the app is now continuously trying to get me to pay for the paid monthly membership. I've already paid for the version I want, I shouldn't need to turn down offer after offer that I don't want. Today alone, two notifications have pinged on my phone to get me to upgrade along the lines of ""we've got something special for you"". Horrifying. Avoid if you don't like being harassed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The free version does everything I need it to yet constant adds to go premium when I don't want the extras.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wow awesome..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use interface. easy to lock. accessible on various devices. i use the free version and it has helped me keep track of things very well. you cannot search entires in unpaid version which is something i would have liked. overall its a good jumpstart."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"its ok not super easy to use in flow state."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it. free version is great. upgraded because I use it so much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app for diary and daily favorite photos keep ping"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. I love the portability of it. Can access it anytime anywhere on any device that you may have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This app just does not present an easy or compelling way to write and keep writing. Face it - you don't want to spend $30 on something you won't actually use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it ❤ Easy to use and great that it can be backed up to your Google account 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"outstanding"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty good features and the only one that is truly multi platform. I just wish the templates feature was available on mobile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect i write my feelings and secrets here :3"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hello, Can anybody help me in getting this finger print option get turned on. It is not getting on. I am an idiot to pay the subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a very useful and easy application to use. Easy to scroll back through previous entries or search for one in particular. Full marks for simplicity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"one of the top 3 of my favorite apps and way worth the money. I updated my review because this app deserves the five stars. I gave a rating of less because I was not thinking about all the hard work many many people put into providing us with the best of the best. I only was thinking about not wanting to pay anyone for the top quality app. that was wrong and unfair"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app but it should allow for multiple user generated diaries (not just tags). E.g. Business diary, dream journal and so on..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Intuitive and smooth."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"love the app, I just wish it could be better organized in categories but other than that. great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nothing to gripe about. Works perfectly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I downlaoded the app, but I never made any purchases and it took about 30$ from my Paypal. Please refund me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's pretty neat."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a great app a shame I can't export or print my entries without the membership seems kinda like a cheap move"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy thought catcher"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing diary tool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love it in the premium version where you can safe the entries on cloud so you can use this anywhere. I used to use another app that has all my entries written there, but there was no cloud I can back it up in. This app I absolutely love in the premium version. I bought it while it was on sale. Anyways, I also loved the fact you can print it on pdf file. Also able to add images to the entries. There are many things I love about this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app on the store. Clean design, simple interface and the availability of the app on every platform encourages you to use it more and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Reply: I already have the latest version I use this for simple text entries. Nice interface,but their own pop up ad is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. Import export functions OK. I like the fingerprint and PIN locker."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"If I wanted to upgrade to premium, I would've upgraded to premium. There is no need to remind me every 2 seconds. And there is absolutely no need the ad to cover half of my screen permanently to the point where I can't see my entries and check what I've written, because the only thing I see is your stupid ""Let's Upgrade"" Edit: Reply to your reply - Is that an ultimatum? Either upgrade to premium or you'll have half your screen covered?The ads are FOR THE PREMIUM UPGRADE!And work on your English!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, very convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's great for writing a journal in a digital format and it is easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is beautiful in its simplicity. I have a thought, or a list, and i can quickly jot it down. You can add emotions, tags, pictures, and probably more... The kids do something adorable, I can take a pic and create memory. The entire world doesn't need to know. Anyway, simple easy to use app to track and journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! I've used it for a year and a half now, (I think... might be two years now) and it's awesome! I love that I can post pictures with my entries, print them, and use my phone or my computer to write. Is there a way to print my entries in a bound book by chance? I love the ability to digitally keep my journal but I would love to have hard copy of my own too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that's gets the job done. I would recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"constantly asking to buy premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, one little thing about adding picture is that it can't be reordered, kinda annoying to add it one by one to make the order that i want. it would be nice if the picture are ordered as selected, with a selection dot with number as well. the pop up for the sales comes up to often. i have brought the premium and have no interest in buying the membership. Wish there's a way to opt out of the offer forever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I enjoy this app because I can save pics as well as my choice of language"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it's not a bad app. just too much pressure to get the upgraded package."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you @TwoAppStudio"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it. It's better than the others that I downloaded."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Excellent features even on the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the only thing in my life right now in which I can confide."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"ใช้ง่าย มี # มีค้นหาได้"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app even though I have not used the premium yet. I am testing it before I go premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really fun and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ive been using this for 2 years. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can easily make a journal entry when needed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very gud"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes documenting easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I told you I wanted to cancel my membership. It says I can cancel any time. I tried to cancel right away when you said my charge was $29.99 a year. I got an overdraft fee because I was unable to cancel.  I plan to post this anywhere I can. Thank you for making a fixed income persons life even worse."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far it is good with a smooth interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Could you guys let us see longer periods of mood tracker data on the chart? It only shows max till 12 months. You can add it to the premium features if you want. I really want the data. I've been using for 3 years now and 12 months is too short."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"wish it was free for membership but love what is offered for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has helped me to be more grateful, to pray everyday. it is easy to use. you can add pics or video to your day. I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice basic app. does mood and pictures too,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good initial experience. It heavily pushes you to upgrade each time you open the app. After paying for premium it continually asks you to rate the app. Overall good experience but annoying push for payment and rating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has been very flexible in capturing important thoughts. i really love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"finished to use it - annoying ads in free version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice. simple. would be nice to be able to add tags, formatting and moon phases as well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much I have it 5 stars. I've no problems with it since I've downloaded it, I record my things and auto saves my things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is nice to have a place to write thoughts down on the fly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Update: re response- you claimed a 'tailored for me special rate', but it's to all customers?! eh? not very unique to me. Let's be CLEAR. MY issue is your sales method, not my being singled out (which clearly I wasn't) so your answer though nice, is tosh. I've had cheap ripoff apps that were less pushy, one customer lost and one terrible review placed, I'd read good things, but after opening the app it told me I had 60 seconds to pay, or lose a 'tailored for me special rate' !?(see above)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this easy and quick some days I write novels"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I feel this app could be a huge benefit in my life as it is simple and easy to maneuver through."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very easy to use I am thankful for Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i have been using this app on and off since 2015. im now consolidating my other notes and entries from other apps / storage into this because it seems to be the best one and the one i use the most."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for keeping journal entries synced up across platforms. I use Journey on Windows and Android and it has been a very seamless experience so far. Very simple design and very easy to use. 10/10 would recommend as a daily diary/journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I searched for a free journal app. This came up, free 7 day trial. NOT WHAT I SEARCHED FOR. Very deceiving."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! So convenient to use, love that I can attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i like to write down about my day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"works great. has some unnecessary features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"For some reason is the Journey view confusing. Maybe I am missing highlighted title in each record, not sure if the markdowns do it. (comparing to DayOne i was satisfied with). And also in the Journey view, the date, time and icons take almost half of the space. It would be nice to show more text, but remain it compact. [Update 180119] The markdowns are not really what I have meant. You can create heading, but it does not make it more visible in the ""Journey View"". I simply miss a title."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"thank you so much journey for keeping my emotions with you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Look no further. The app does it all. text, photos, location, mood icons, maps. My favorite is if you take photos during the day or whenever you can import the photo and with the photo comes the time, location, date so you can easily back date your journal via photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really helping me to write my thoughts on demand."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Free 7 day demo only, pass!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"5 star given.. It a good app to write diary.. Keep up the good work 😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app when you want to create non social media posts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app, useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love having my diary on hand 24/7.. can sync to other devices.. search back through old entries.. definitely 5 stars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Would be great if we could search by date than choosing from the calendar"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have found this app useful. I started with the free version and it advertises itself mostly which is better than other ads. However, with some of the features like drawing and emotions, etc., I expected it to be more conducive for creative expression with words. Right now I can't even make a word bold, or italic, or underlined. This makes my journal entries very text heavy and bland. I would also appreciate a way to title my entries. I know I can use tags, but I prefer titles."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Move from Diaro & Day One to this app. So far so good~ 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it! I have tried a few ones but this is the one that I like the most, even the free version has already a few nice features 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I really love this app. However, I do NOT want my journal to be digital forever. the fact that I could export my journal and get it printed was appealing but that has not worked out at all. when I export it the pictures are ginormous. or the word file is importable to book printing companies but the photo files are not. PLEASE fix this journey!! i have nearly 2 years with of journal entries in your app and i definitely want it printed into a hardbound book."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app, it's easy to use and all my data is backed up to the cloud. Great way to keep a diary of my travels. I have no issues with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best phone journal app I have used so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"it doesn't have any clear indicator if you successfully uploaded the pics/vid or not -_-"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app is great and offers a lot but is very aggressive when it comes to ads so be aware! I think it would be better to give the user time in the app before requesting to upgrade to a premium version. ( Maybe at least 10 minutes) At the time, I had just downloaded the app and didn't even have time to explore before the ""buy this feature"" popped up. Over time, for those who enjoy journaling, I do believe the app offers enough to validate the price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used the app for a couple of years now, and it has evolved so much. The one feature I'd like to see in the near future from Journey is the ability to make a custom layout when attaching photos, just like magazines or something, where texts could wrap around the photos. Other than that, this app is a great contender to Day One, if not better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's just great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app. Never had a Journal app before but I've been using it for the past few days and I love it. Definitely forces me to write my thoughts down."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It not serves as a great daily diary, but it also allows me to capture important information on the fly. I use it as a calendar/notebook as well as a journal. The full version is well worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this app is a great for journaling and put it in your thoughts and prayers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If cheaper will be better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best diary app so far. its very simple and the interface is smooth."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have a lot of thoughts throughout the day, so many that my memory can't keep up! Luckily, I found Journey. Easy to use and straight to the point, I can just whip out my phone, create a note and get on with my day. Loved it so much that I bought the premium version! Brillant work guys. 5/5"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I put the icon on my home page and that reminds me to use. So simple but everything I need. Actually helping to keep me on track Didn't expect that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it on my phone, Chromebook and PC. Syncs across everything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the functionality of this app! I highly recommend it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The head of the company, and the other one is a little more than others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"is it safe to put personal things in this...can anyone use this unless me?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely a must! Appreciate the makers of this app👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this - so useful and nice visual design"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The most useful journaling app I've ever come across. I'm definitely planning on paying for a subscription, but even the features on the free version are amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal is the best one I have found, and I have tried many. It's like your own private Facebook in a way. I love the layout, super easy to use, many cool options. I highly suggest trying it out!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Realky great journa. although ibtegrating rich text & pasting so more akin to Evernote would make it a real 'holy grail' of apps. Please consider!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use, doesn't always pick up a correct location but can be amended, loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"* help please * Hey guys, I really love your app, got a problem though: I paid for the full version, now upgraded my phone - and the full version is gone. How can I restore it without having to pay again? Also I should mention I changed my email address in the play store - worked absolutely fine with other apps though. Your free version got too many ads... :( Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I have been using it for a little over a week and I write in it every day and sometimes multiple times. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"good for daily entries but has irritating, constant reminder to upgrade to paid subscription that cannot be turned off."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its really beautiful and really fits me. And I love the motivations and quotes it give.💓"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! I love that it syncs across devices, and find I use it often because it's always readily available. The only wish I have is that you could have separate journals, like notebooks, that you could use for different things... but I kind of work around that with great tags, so I can still pull out all the related items."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The premium is so worth it. it's super organized and theres not an overwhelming amount of features that makes it feel more like a planner. 10/10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use. reminds me if i forget to journal. great app. for some reason i can't figure out the speech to text on my iPhone. Android works great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app except for all the super annoying ads that pop up over and over and over. I get that I'm using the free version and I expect some ads. but there was an update within the last 6 or so months that seems like a glitch with how many ads there are. the only reason I'm not switching is because all my journaling is stored in this one and I don't want to transfer. TLDR: -Super annoying ads that pop up over and over -Nice starring feature makes finding important entries easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very good and useful. it's even better knowing that it syncs with Google drive and by so doing, you have your memories intact. Forever. lol. That's as long as the Google drive still exists 😊😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it and wished I used it more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"its quick, easy and simple to use. I've paid for the subscription monthly. I'm enjoying using it. I can log all my daily activities and thoughts. I like it, I have an android phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I installed this because it was on the top of the list but hmmm... You have to pay to unlock features and still you won't get everything... And there are not many useful features. You can't put titles, you can't record custom stats. And still you have to pay..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm new to the app, but so far it's really great. I wish there were fewer ads. not really ads, more of up sell."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I haven't had this but a few days so I am learning. I like the calendar & other buttons at the bottom. I gave it a four but as I learn it, I'll rerate it if need be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this, I'm going to use it everyday!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"For what it is, its exactly what it is. Doesnt even bother to claim it, this app shows up to work when called and goes home when dismissed, ready to respond again on command. For someone trying to make a notebook out of it, stop that. For the memo shark, give up. this app is perfect for the ADD addled artist with a billion ideas hitting them at work that they can take 3-5 minutes away and jot down clear, vivid descriptions of what they need to remember, in their own language, in their own way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it! Sad to say I have to pay to enjoy everything.... but naaah! No matter... I so love the app. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love using this app to write in the morning after my yoga practice. The clean interface helps me stay focused."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Handy dandy 👌👌 👌😉"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Clean and intuitive UI. Smooth animations. Great for keeping notes with photos/voice notes, etc even if you're not using it as a diary. The full price point for premium wasn't attractive to me, but I did get premium on sale at the start of the year, which was a more fair price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Wow. It's so full of ads for itself that It's hardly useable!! It keeps pushing for me to sign up for a membership! There's gotta be a free journaling app out there that's less demanding. It's also not as ""beautiful"" as it claims to be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app. keep up the good work devs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I needed for actually keeping a journal consistently!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what i was looking for to track my goals in 2019."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i adore this app, i use it everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app that is easy to use 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. This app has really helped me jot down dreams, insights, and thoughts I want to remember. I recommend!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like it I write on it a lot and it's good that you can access from your computer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to use it. very helpful me to organize pic and the detail. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Out of the many apps I tried, this one fits the job description the best. Fingerprint authentication, tags, nice, simple design, plenty of options to format your text. I'm being drawn to write in my journal daily and thanks for that. A nice surprise was to discover that besides the H1 heading that the format menu offers, one can use ## for H2, ### for H3(orange) , #### for H4(blue) , until H7. A nice to have would be bullet points, in various shapes, hope the team is seeing this. Good job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy this app ! It's easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Everything is great except how many times you want to ask me to upgrade... Lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this app inspires me to keep a daily journal and help me privately express how i really feel about the day i love it so much!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I use it to track my symptoms for an illness that I have since I easily forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app for keeping a diary. would give more stars if it weren't for the CONTINUOUS ads begging for me to pay for an upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app. love the sync feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"honestly even without the pro version, it's been really helpful for me. Been using it for a year, and have no regrets 🎆"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app so much. Formatting text is frustrating on mobile. It's consolidated to one button, which could be convenient. But I'm clumsy, and I keep selecting the wrong one. I also want a way to select which photo displays in your timeline. It defaults based on which photo was taken first I think. Which some times isn't the most memorable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The ui is great. But ux sucks. Can't focus on what I'm trying to do with all the obtrusive ads. I ended up using Daybook."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's very helpful to remind something. thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it is very lovely app. It prompted me to write my food diary. it should have category of diaries also, so that we keep different notes in different subject diaries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love this free journal. I liked the app so much, when they offered a holiday sale, I bought the upgraded features! I love that I can attach things to my entry. I have attached voice memos, for those days where I just need to talk and not kill my hands typing so much. I have attached cool pictures of places I've been and then journal about them. I have also added uplifting or funny memes. It is very easy to use. I'm so glad I tried this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app- I set a timer to remind me to journal, flipped it to night mode so I can write in bed, attached photos to entries. A worthy investment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"still learning how to use this app. So far great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've really loved using this app. I have a journal I can connect pictures to without losing it to a social network board. 😊 And I can back it up as PDFs (doesn't work for videos but pictures are awesome!)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal App is awesome for keeping notes about random thoughts & activities. It's fun to look at where you've been a year ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app to manage a diary with all you need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good aesthetics. Useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"im desperately trying to cancel this, it says you can cancel anytime but i can't see how to? in the help menu, there is NO option to cancel. i dont want this app, its certainly not worth £29 ! please can someone tell me how to cancel this before it charges my account! thank you STILL NOT CANCELED AND TAKEN MY MONEY! have emailed 3 times, no response! please refund my money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal to keep track of whatever activity you want."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"stupid pricing. says firesale 50% of but doesnt give a price. doesnt give a price atcall for subscription. how do you expect me to consider subscription if you dont tell me how much it is. rubbish app in free form cant tell you about paid form coz no pricing given!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best app! I will use it all my life! Thanks you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app. journalling is fun and useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i like the features, the ui is simple and easy to use. but it'll be better if there's checkbox feature, thankyou for the great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was angry to have allowed the exorbitant price to go swinging out of my bank account as a result I am deleting cc info from my accounts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Takes time getting used to . . bought life time on discount"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy-to-use. I try to write something every day or every other day. Best app for this that I have tried."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"App keeps mixing enteries, even making double copies of the same entery on diferent dates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app to keep a journal. I found it very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if you like to journal then you will love journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Probably one of the greatest apps in my life. It helps jot down my inner thoughts I never thought I could have. Just don't show your premium ad too much. Show them. But not too much. I can't afford the premium now. But once I do , I will . And also if I minimise a note , it closes and move back to home page. It doesn't work perfect in split screen too. ❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple interface and elegant options to maintain a diary habit. Since I do write via the mobile, their app is indeed very handy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have paid for this app, I was supposed to get access to entire features but it isn't accepting my fingerprint...i can't set up the fingerprint lock.can I know why?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Grest app. I set it to remind me to write, and I thinknit is a good design and very user friendly. Probably worth paying for premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"its a good app. but i would have liked it more if it provided me different sections for different types of journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent app. Does everything I would ever need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it!!!!! It is like a diary that is as big as I need.... over all my different computers and phone .... and I can add pictures too.... so it is way better than a paper one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've had this journaling app for years, and it remains my favorite. So many features, easy to synch from phone to tablet. And it locks, so privacy is a plus."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would love to give 5 stars but the interface is not the easiest to use and videos and documentation on how to use it is not clear"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"not free!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great little app. It seems like there's a free version, there's a paid version saying you can get better features. I am enjoying the free version, I'm able to journal my day and review past days for now. I don't know how long this will last but for now it's a great free version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Help me to remember important things I have done. I love it. Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it says it does. i just wish there was a way to automatically back up my entries to Google Drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good APP. and i bought as Premium benefit. App is easy to used. and i can sync my Journey from my both devices (iOS & Android). And it would be very good if this app can remind as a hightligh what we have recorded last month or last two months. anyway i love this App. 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The UI is minimalistic and easy to use, have been using it alot and really loving this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I can voice-type with Google keyboard. It's on my phone, so always in my pocket and accessable. It handles the mechanics of journaling for me, like, ""Where's my journal?"" It dates and formats entries. It's searchable and has tags. Journey makes journaling easy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has one of the best interface among similar apps I've used. There is also a tab where you can see a summary of your past entries which is a nice addition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I remember sitting there one day thinking to myself how amazing it is when people have journals that span huge time frames of their lives. It's a record for you and your family, and it's really fun to keep and look back on. There are so many reasons just to journal that journey makes a ton of sense. But it's the extras that really do it. All the data it captures is great; mood, temp, location, pictures, etc. The reminder is great. The shortcut to put on your home screen to one click is awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I've paid for the premium version but it goes back to the non-premium mode everytime I use it. It keeps on asking me to 'restore purchase'. Even doing that doesn't help. Now I regret buying it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have just recently tried out the web version of Journey. It looks fine, but the sync was messed up. My most recent post only had two paragraphs, even though i wrote more. Confused, i just edited some posts. When i opened the app, the missing paragraphs were there, but when i synced, they were gone. Why didn't the website include my full post in the first place? It's frustrating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works as I want it to, it starts each new entry with a date and time stamp automatically. Lots of abilities I will probably never use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice and really helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The advertising is a real turn off. especially high pressure ones saying the deal ends when the card is dismissed. they also have a separate subscription for the desktop version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use. i like tagging notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"There is an $8.99 (or more) pay wall for most features in the app, go figure. Unless you pay $8.99 (or more) it acts exactly like Samsung Notes, which is already on everybody's phone, it just shows you the date and location differently."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app! the ability to add pictures to the day makes me happy!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"best place to store anything in your mind...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. The features are very convenient for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app but could be even better if I could use my S pen with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quite an easy to use app. I just resumed journaling again and I am loving it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"One thing I really like is being able to use on more than one device. Also the premium version allows me too print it off."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i wish they would stop putting up the upgrade page over and over"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for almost 2 years now & I love it. The only thing I don't like is if u switch phones like from android to iPhone u have to rebuy the app and that's not fair."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best part: accessibility without opening app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"would you like to upgrade to premium membership? this is the question it wont stop asking after literally everything you do. great idea and would use the app but not with the constant adverts and badgering to upgrade. find another app that does not do this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is AMAZING!! I find it difficult to procrastinate thanks to this app! It really helps to have all your diary entries in one place, safe and secure with a passcode only you know and not having to make sure to hide it from others again and again which is the case if you were writing it in a book. Moreover, it is really convenient to have such an app since if we were writing in a book, we'd have to carry that around, and as more time passes the heavier its gonna get."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I've been using as a journal for all my transgender related things where I can vent in piece and its wonderful. I've had to change phones and I had thought I lost everything but it saved it all!! it's super easy to use and looks nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for keeping an ongoing log of goings-on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, still lots to discover"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great way to record my thoughts!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"brilliant app for diary keeping 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. I love the different modes, and how freeform it is. My only complaint is that you can't add templates to work from, but other then that It's a great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journaling program. I love that is connected to all my devices and backed up online."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is one of the greatest."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice APP..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App...I get to write my daily activities down....just love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"enjoying my journaling as I f now amd hoping to continue amd increase my love for it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"These people stole my money and wont give it back.  Terrible customer service.  I wanted to trial the app as advertised for 7 days, they prompt me for payment upon  first login, I assume I can still trial? NOPE.  Reached into my wallet and took my money, then say I have to report it to Google Play, who do NOTHING.  All I did was download the app and then delete it within minutes.  What a horrible experience.  **Update** The developers tell me I bought the subscription at a discount, not a free trial.    That makes so much sense I dont even feel robbed anymore! Give me my money back you thieves!!  **Update2** Developers suggest Google providing a refund, which has already been denied because it doesn't meet criteria. i.e.- 48 hrs after purchase. I submitted refund request within minutes after purchase.  Nothing.  Terrible experience and shameless studio."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything it's promised to be. Premium is great, totally worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its very useful to view past and correct the thing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very simple and easy to navigate. you can tag your stuff so you can search it later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app ever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep a journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I found 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"the paid version is great, has all the featurs i want. however even though i paid for the premium version i keep getting ads for promotions for the subscription. one of the reasons i bought the app was to not get ads - why cant i ask to never be advertised the subscription?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use mobile or laptop. Pictures are simple to add and look good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I like some of the ideas, but it is Very annoying that the app keeps advertising charges and fees to me, it constantly makes me worry that I might lose what I've written so as a result Im copy & pasting everything into Google Notes which is FREE & asking myself why Im bothering with this ludicrous app that throws an advert for subscription at me every few minutes. They Actually put Night Mode (a health & safety feature) in Premium!! Says it all about company mind set really...huffs. #GREED"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"so far, so good. a but pricey."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have been using the free version for some time now. This app is great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like its simplicity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, good interface. Privacy is held well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this, you can add pictures, it has emojis for how you are feeling. Great for Journaling, creating, expressing your moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice to have a food diary that doesnt focus on Macros, and lets me take pictures of meals"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love it! However, an update. I purchased the premium version of this app in September of 2015. Today, while using it, I got a pop-up offer for a 50% discount on a monthly plan? Dropping from 5 stars to 3 until I get an explanation."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and I love that I can attach pictures and create PDFs. I will use this probably forever!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good and interesting apps"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Across all platform I have my thoughts and ideas, sweet!! I was looking for a mobile app that also had a web interface and Journey is it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling helps me in releving my mind of thoughts. Journey is so user friendly and works great for jotting down thoughts or deep processing. The reminders help when I need to journal and forget. Great great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying it. it is easy to make entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So love the app but it has one weird quirk and one kind of nuisance. First the quirk: I am not sure I understand the Google Fit intergration. It doesn't seem to do anything. Is it just collecting data to be sold? I don't get it. Nuisance: I already purchased the app on desktop and mobile prior to the premium subscription being implemented and have no need for the subscription yet I regularly get the pop up ad for it. It would be nice if this was removed for the ones who purchased the app before you decided to do a subscription. Remove that, and I will totally 5 star it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the app but it says something about a 7 day free trial then pay 29.99 I thought it was a free app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to keep a journal on daily activities and a good place to store memories and media for special occasions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried many journaling apps, but this is the one I keep coming back to. Ultimately, the only feature worth having is that I'll use it consistently. The simplicity of interface helps to keep from distracting me while I'm writing, so it's easy to just write. At the same time, it's flexible enough to enjoy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love it. Keeps everything perfectly and I never have to worry about losing my progress when I smash my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app easy to use and helps me monitor habits"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It will let me write about my personal information about the world"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great simple photo journal. I'm using out top keep track of what i eat and when. i don't care about the nutritional micro-whatever's, i just want to keep a record of what i eat and when. the photos make it very easy to dip so and show portion sizing. by tagging entries, i can quickly find breakfast, lunch, dinner, and moods."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app. beautiful app that has just the right balance between functionality and simplicity. time and geo tag can be taken over from a picture, pretty smart! nice graphical view of your history."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I tried other apps for writing a journal before but this one works better for me.. Don't know why, but it just does..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am IN love with this app. Has been the best place to keep track of our first week as foster parents."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Okay, the overall appearance is amazing, it's clean and simple. The night mode is also very appealing and comfortable. But I want to ask something: 1. Why I couldn't sign in? It's been a couple of days I use the app with internet (to do geotagging and add weather) but still couldn't sign in. And finally, some advices. 1. Design. Please improve the entry list look. The spacing between text lines and geotag, weather, etc. is good, but too large between text lines, and too narrow between time (e.g. 18.45) and photo. They look quite unpleasant especially with Ideal Sans. I think the best spacing rules (for me): - First text line and time: no change. - Text lines: 1x as the text, but for Verlag, etc. should be narrower than that. - Photo: as same as first text line and time. - Location, Weather, Activity, Mood line below the text lines: no change. 2. Font. Perhaps, premium users have the access to change their font with what available in device. Subfamily may also included, as JotterPad does. Otherwise, please add some more font, such as classic Oswald and Lobster. Overall, the app is worth it and the best choice for almost everyone. I really appreciate your magnificent hard work, keep improving it to your best. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app. I use it daily to jot down my thoughts and life story. Not one malfunction in the 2 months I've beem using it. Keep it up guys. And thanks a lot for this! :)"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect, except that for some reasons I can't buy premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'd like to be able to add more videos in the premium edition. The rest is fine"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need it to. Simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like writing down a gratitude list every day. Having this app on my phone is great, because as soon as something gratitude-worthy happens I can write it down right then, lest I forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Auwsome one , Useful for me one suggestion is to add a feature to attach audio"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a good app, and with the paid version probably one of the best. But that's the problem, it keeps buzzing me to get the paid version. I cant even save an entry without the reminder,and that's the third reminder in 2 minutes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app, good features and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Simple design, auto pulls info that I wouldn't record manually like weather and fitness. Love the simple icons for mood. I can easily gage trends at a glance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"@Journey: Diary, Journal, please I want to cancel my annual subcription because of the cost on me. But I still want to continue my Premium account. Will cancelling my subscription wipe off my entire history and records? Because, I want to remain safe while cancelling the annual subscription. please respond asap."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a great way to keep track of your thoughts and dreams. You can keep going back to remember where you were in your thoughts at a particular time in your life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"way too many ads for upgraded versions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Probably the best journal app available for Android right now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Retrying, good app, incl. tags but less visual than Diaro."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am enjoying this journal so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great application for writing and documenting your daily adventures in a similiar but modern approach to the personal journal or ""Diary""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my needs😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"ONLY 7 DAYS FREE! I read about it...installed it...went through their walk through... all set to use it... AND THEN they hit you with the price. That's sheer dishonesty in my book. There's no way I'm using a kg company for my journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"యాప్ నిజంగా చాలా అద్భుతంగా ఉంది"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I hope to see more life features... Thank you to the team & Happy New year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"so far so good will rate once i have used a little lobger than 2 days"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just got back to using this app after having tried it out in 2016. Love the simplicity and functions, nice interface, still exploring it at the moment, but so far so good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like the app. its convenient for having a place to jot my thoughts when im not on my computer or at home. I paid for upgrade to add pictures and videos but i don't like that it limits it to 10 minutes per entry. thats why i only gave it 4 🌟."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Near perfect Journaling app! I use it to track my sleeping and waking patterns, my workouts, my meals, my thoughts and feelings throughout the day. This allows me to fully track how I'm spending my time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"they dont tell you it costs anything until you half way sign up then they hit you with the bill !! NO WAY NO THANKS WHAT A RIP OFF !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the only thing that makes me actually keep a journal! I've tried so many times and always fall off. So far, I've been able to stay on track"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i love being able to use my voice to text when journalling in the middle of the night. saves me waking up as much to take notes by typing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy the free version of this app. I think my favorite feature is that it tracks your mood. I also love that it allows you to attach photos and to write seperate entries multiple times a day. My only annoyance is that I cant seem to escape the premium subscription ads every time I open it. oh, and it's also incredibly useful that it allows you to add a password to the app itself so that even of someone has access to your phone, like a spouse, they won't have access to your journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy way to jot down a journal. The customer service is live and helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Don't sign up for the ""free trial"" if you're not prepared to pay in full for this app. It didn't quite do what I needed so I tried to cancel before the 7 days were up. There is no apparent way to cancel. Deactivating your account won't do it because I still got charged. I've tried contacting the company and was directed to an article about how to sign up, but nothing about canceling. Now they just keep asking why the article wasn't helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"been using this app since last phone few years ago. it's nice that it saved my log and all after the change. It's useful for everyday thing or not, quick enough and simple to use. personal or public it's user friendly and even saves the location, pictures or even the temp if you allow it. I reccomend it because I been using it a long time and it's been there for the good and bad events in my life. its password protected and cheap."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Lets me keep memories organized. I like that when you input a photo it brings in the photo details."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is so good that it just take out every feeling of your heart and, wrote it down. Every thing which you can't tell anyone.😯 Which you have to do everyday. 😊 Your mistakes which you have to improve. 😝 Every beautiful collection of your memories.😍 Everything you can write it down and feel light and relaxed 😘😘. There is no ten stars rating otherwise i would be given this app 10 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love this app. It does everything it says. Easy to use, you can add photos, mood, and so much more, plus it's very secure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, easy to use journaling app that allows you to add pictures and locations. Surprisingly hard to find, but here it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"$30 just letting you know"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"loved it. Had every option that i expected. including some additional features. I couldn't get any better than this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this helps keep daily records on health, emotions and nutrition (and anything else that may come up)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great APP !! with lot of  scope for improvements. Good feature is we can access in various platform .  Suggestions : 1. Can you make it compatible with Amazon devices ? 2. Add a feature to convert the journal into fancy album, may be in JPEG or PDF. with just date photos and words .  It should have pre-defined layout for album and also  customize option 3.Editing in web is bit tricky . I cannot edit for previous dates and also i was unable to add hash tag. i was using chrome 4. if it integrates with google app and if we can add audio logs directly , it will be amazing feature. we can add the log  Thanks for the grt app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Not a letdown."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great apps love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The one & only Apps that i will not uninstall at all! Super loved it! Would be better if we could add image in the text itself like android notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this is good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to journal app and I love it! I love how you can set up a passcode for privacy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and import files from previously used apps. Can use across platforms and even web-based. Worth the upgrade too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really do love this app. I journal across my phone and computer and I add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been what I was wanting and expecting. The crucial feature for me is the way it works across platforms. This combined with the export option is essential in a journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app! so convenient, gives me a great space to journal quickly any time and anywhere and keep it secure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great journaling tool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love that you can convert a range of diary entries to a pdf or word document. That's actually why I chose this app. I wish that you could select the order that the pictures you attach to entries are displayed. As of now they are displayed in the order of the time they were taken."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app that exceeds my expectations of what a diary or journaling app is supposed to be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple to use with some great features. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice to be able to go back and read just how i was feeling at the moment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Great way to record a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using Journey since its inception, and I've stuck with it despite trying other apps now and then. It's the best diary app on the market. Day One comes close these days with IFTTT integration and links between entries, but Journey trumps it in terms of export options. No app out there has got PDF exporting right - photos are too big, text is too small, including Journey, but at least you can export entries into MS Word format and you can resize photos and text to your liking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. It's amazing. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Intuitive, effortless, snappy. solid app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that I don't have add banners anywhere. I can have uninterrupted writing. I love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app please add some font style colours , wallpaper make diary more attractive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really love to use this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nice, but expensive. I liked the service enough to purchase the annual $30 subscription, but when I tried to open the Windows version I was hit with another $15 paywall.  I'm all for supporting the devs, but $45 is a bit much.  It makes me wonder how many more paywalls they have in store for their users.  I'm rating it one star because of the multiple paywalls and the fact that as of this writing, unless I'm missing something there's no mention of the paywalls in the description.  If there was mention of them it'd give interested users more information to make a decision whether or not they want to use the service.  Surprise charges after the fact aren't a good idea."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love the app, i dont like the price"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick, easy, intuitive way to record one's faith walk, discipling notes, and prayer requests by others. Spiritual memory for most of us is short, but this app provides one a great tool to remember God's promises, His grace, and provision. I use it daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use journal app with the ability to do vlog and capture moods & geo location. I paid for the premium version; well worth the investment :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journalling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No app is worth $29 a year for what can be done free on a word processor. I empathise with this company's need to be profitable or ehy have any business. But with nearly every developer reaching for another subscription, the cost is nust becoming all the reason O needed to delete this app as soon as I was offered 50% off after installing only if I buy in right now. Tell me, what happens to all my most treasured thoughts if you raise the price or its just not affordable at renewal date? Delete it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"i think is a good journal spp -- but journalling on a phone is still hard (mostly typing paragraphs) but with this app inserting pictures where you want them seems hard. Seems more like one picture per entry, where picture always comes first."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"cheating and wasting peoples time... why cant u mention its paid app before downloading.. . why cant u mention upfront its chargeable... total waste of time.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Really like the media feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very easy to.use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very very helpful in keeping track of my thoughts. Plus the features are also very helpful as with the place and the time and day, it relives the moment you were writing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"allows me to backdate when I forget to add an item."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. nice user interface ad free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awaome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"nothing's perfect of course, but this app has really helped me to quickly jot down my thoughts before they escape me and I move on with the rest of my day, the rest of my life. it preserves things as they are at that moment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just downloaded this app and it's amazing so far. I think I'm just so excited that I can put my thoughts and experiences without the world reacting (likes and comments) lool. Two things that I think can take this app to another level are: 1. Being able to colour code posts by their subjects- e.g inspiration, achievements, experiences, etc. This makes it more personable/interesting and allows to easily find previous posts. 2. Give an option to change how the day's journal is displayed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for journal writing with best UX."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love having a place to express my thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this diary is more like live to me...thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Using the app now for a week, love the functionality, hate the adds for premium. On the border of uninstalling it, or buying premium, but probably the first one. It would be a lot nicer not to have to click away the pop-ups every entry and give us time and breathing room to decide to go to premium or not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what i wanted. Simple and effective. Excellent response from developer regarding small ussue. Resolved quickly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Honestly love this app. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. it is my carry-with me diary. very convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use and its flexible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"What happened to my premium? I bought it 2 years ago and now it's gone? Wth? I even followed the steps in their help section, but no positive result."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's just it what they are saying it will be. 'Journey' when you read what you wrote in it you'll feel like you are on a journey to your past. It is amazing. Keep it up guys. You are doing great with every update."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"super perfect app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it amazing like as if there were another wo4d for amazing and it doesn't share your location unless you want it to"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps in the play store. It is beautiful, and very helpful. Bought the premium version. No regrets."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good because it gets sync fast."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed that publishing to Facebook has now disappeared. I heard that Fb changed their APIs but despite multiple queries to the dev team have not had any update. Is a fix in the pipeline? They said ""soon"" a year ago..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this App for pass 3 years plus."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it to record dreams, keep recipes and jot down my feelings for the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app for catching random thoughts. awesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. I wish I didn't have to see the ""buy premium/membership"" pop-up's all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"📱App⏪Is😂Hilarious😍Lovable😥Helpful😢Sad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journal apps I ever used ... simple and fast."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think I've reviewed this before so I will keep it brief. Just get this program. You will love it. It is both very practical and a lot of fun. And they are constantly seeking ways to make it even better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great journaling app, and I've been using it consistently for over a year now and I'm satisfied with the experience. However, I feel that, even with premium, it's pretty rigid in terms of personalizing the entries. Maybe to-do lists or customisable text colors and sizes (more than the preset color/size headers)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"money grabbers! time limited payment choices, pressure the user into making a snap decision to sign up to a subscription. then the user must remember to cancel the subscription if they ever wish to stop using the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Charging to back up the journal.. Loser move. Uninstalled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ads still visible even though I ""pay once to unlock forever"". Also doesn't import Daylio though it says it does."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"i am not getting notifications properly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I recommend buying the premium version. Iys the most imporatnt thing i ve in my phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"very good app, and very invaluable, the ads are a bit annoying, especially after i have paid for night mode however"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Features that I buy this app: 1. design for multiple posts in a day (better may you add day-of-week and group month-year section instead?); 2. mark-down formatting. Further requests: 1. option to display in ascending order; 2. search query for no-tag posts; 3. display tags of each post in list view; 4. URL preview/thumbnail. Thanks in advance 😃"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great app for journaling. Need to increase more safety data"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like this app. Makes journaling simple, and solves the problem of not needing to remember a physical journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app is very useful but after now I forget my password, how can I retrive it? Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"They Are ALL Gone!!!! I logged into the app today to post a journal and everything is gone. Over 2 years of entries ALL gone!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good journal ,"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic journaling app. Wonderful, simple features and even worth the premium upgrade."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"use it for my log book for my commercial fishing business. Very easy to use the location part of it convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app. I would have switched to it if it could import my 750 entries in Private Diary Pro. Also, I wish it had text formatting capability."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"it's free for only 7days . no point in keeping a paid journal when you can just use notes on your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"amazing app and very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"pretty awesome dont think it should cost so much for premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful. I can save memories really easily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and convenient to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Poor syncing, poor customer support: edits on web and in the app within a few minutes lead to lost/clobbered additions. Customer support is scripted and unfriendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pretty good. Really helpful for checking back on stuff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such an easy app to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The intense nagging for premium means an uninstall. Before a single journal entry it has a pop up for premium monthly subscription. I continue. Another shows up, this time with a ""limited time sale! 50% off for the year! Only valid until I close this pop up!"" So I impulse click it, even though I wanted to test it on free first. When I click through to read more, a 60 second count down is on screen telling you time is running out, you're losing money. I wanted to relax. Uninstall. Predatory app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic, cheap and nothing more to add."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent diary with all the needed functions.... cloud backup.... privacy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a good journal app and has a lot of great features but it has become more 'in your face ' all throughout the app telling you to upgrade to premium. Like, I get it, you want to earn money but I'm too poor to spend money on an app. It's offensive in somr way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"its OK. definitely not worth paying a membership and 6.99 is a bit much fir this app. Im passing. too many ads in trial to really enjoy enoughbto decide whether or not to buy so Meh... moving on. lots of other options for less just as good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to journal on the go"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simply awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"seems to me the dev has lost the balance between pushing sales in the app and UX. Adios, Journey. Salut, Logg"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping my memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a good app. I use it to keep a journal about my kids as they grow up. you can tag each entry, add photos and videos. I love the throwbacks it gives you as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best for keeping not only your journals but also important passwords. Though I wish they could add more slots to save pictures on each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works well have not found out how to correct location or activity time when entered in retrospect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great for writing diary with quick updates f ex on the children's development. too little space for photos, though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect app for journal lovers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love this app. it allows me to track my emotions and journal about my life and what's going on to further my progress with my therapist, and to handle things on my own. it helps me to see my perspective from the outside, and has helped me see how ridiculous, great my thoughts or thought prices was or is at any given time. thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Had it when it came on a CD. Great program and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best I have ever encountered. I enjoy making entries in this fantastic journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"why it's not mentioned in the beginning that it is a paid app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"its so cool my favorite so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Zero out of five! This outfit lies and manipulates. Don't believe the free 7-day trial offer. It doesn't exist, but you only find that out after giving you no other option but to subscribe and having an annual subscription immediately stolen from you, and after complaining via the in-app feedback and getting an automated response that says the 7-day trial is not currently available! Not happy! Demanding my money back and going elsewhere for a jounaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy too dictate your thoughts and exit you journal as needed. Great to be able to add photos or videos, etc. Makes journaling simple and fun."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"fantastic awesome result"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is filled with lots of my memories. When ever i drift away from my goals, i read my own journal which reminds me about my true self. thank you journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I bought the one time payment, and you are still spamming me with the subscription. Can you please stop this...I can believe how this can be editor choice. Respect the user!, purchases are restored and recognised. But you still spam for subscription even though I did a one time payment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is everything I need it to be. It's now 12/24/18 and I have a iPhone. This app isn't available for iOS. I really love this app. please please please bring this app to iOS. I hate most of their journal apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect so far, does everything as advertised."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app for journal entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the scheduled reminders and easy data additions (like geolocation, weather, and date) through photos. Mood tracker is a nice inclusion which almost replaces Daylio for me but I like the stat breakdowns, mood customizations and icon custom tagging that Daylio gives better. Photos is what keeps me interested in Journey though so I do both at the same time every night."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, it reads the date of your photo in the photo and adjust the date of your post, very useful. The only thing confusing is about the Premium version, apparently what I paid for was not for my account but just the Android app installed on my phone. Hence I was asked to pay again when I try to update over Windows app, even when I use the same email account. So in the end, although the app runs on multiple platforms, I can only use one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good dizital diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app for tracking important events. sync across devices and PC is very usefull. Search feature very usefull and accurate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I quite like this journal app, simple, secure with export options. I don't quite understand where the pop ups come from even after purchasing, that's the only drawback. Maybe I've only purchased certain types of exports, but the pop ups are still annoying at times."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use at as a food and training diary. very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Here you can both organize your thoughts and re-remember them, in the way that you can be your best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I didn't intend to pay for a subscription. Please ensure I do not get charged!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love adding in photos and tags and having a journal always with me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply a great journaling app, for whatever you want to journal. They do a great job keeping it updated and it is easy to use. I love that it syncs to the web and that you can print your journals later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great user friendly interface. Easy entries. Great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very helpful with notes organization"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this to track my natural hair journey. i love that i can add picttures to each entry. This app is very user friendly and I enjoy using it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i love journaling and this is perfect for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Thank you for your reply.  I did send an email on 11/27/18 and waited  before posting my rating with no reply.  I still have not seen a response and it has been nearly a month, the popup remains with a useless application."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is awesome because it lets me eaaily access my journal on any device and because it lets me get straight to writing. I'm a very organized person and with Journey I can immediately let out my thoughts and feelings, without having to rationally think what day and date and time it is. It's these little things that truly make a big difference."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"outstanding"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"After extensive research I found the 3 best journal apps. DayOne. Journey. Memorize. But they are all missing one (different) feature each. Journey's main miss is not allowing for multiple journals. Otherwise it's great. It has the best syncing across multiple devices. It allows for web access on your PC (they are primarily designed as apps on phone/tablet). Also has the most versatile print/export options. There are only a few minor tweaks I'll bug them for. Keep up the great work Team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The premium version worked well enough for months until it started nagging me incessantly to pay again for more features and some kind of membership with recurring fees. There is no way to disable the nagging. It is abuse of customers who paid and were promised no ads. Using a different app now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Worst customer service experience ever! They don't even reply back. Don't use them. Go with Diaro."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Should make data backup to Google account free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i really enjoy using this app for my day to day feelings. iys helpful with its reminders incase i didn't write in the diary that day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good and easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been Journaling for 23 days straight now and this app is easy yet perfect for what I need. lots of options like adding images and other great stuff. if you want to record events from life, this is perfect for you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! perfect for on the go journal entries. I love thay everything is safely backed up. I also love the location tagging and that I can add photos to my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a nice journal app. i can track my mood or add a picture or two. i am only giving it 4 stars because there is always room to improve."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"very disappointing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's ok so far, but some features I don't understand, like what is the atlas supposed to be for? And I wish they had different sections like for gratitude, lessons learned, experiences to remember, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app is way better than the web site, but I wish it would stop bugging me to upgrade to premium. It discourages me from using it because every screen you have to dismiss a pop-up asking you to to buy it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💜"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal tool! Easy to use! Because it is so user friendly, I find myself posting almost daily with everything from how my meeting went, to the results of a doctor visit. I love the quick insert options for the location, the weather, and my mood. Very thankful I can also attach photos. Truly enhances the whole journal experience. Mahalo and Aloha!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this App coz it helps me keep track of the fast running time..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. I was able to back up in time to begin recording new relationship."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"amazing app. love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Way too many ads about random things as well as for buying the upgraded version. I just want something simple that I can use without having to close a bunch of ads before I can use it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Use to note my mileage daily not earth shattering thoughts I'm afraid but very useful for that 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have tried a number of these journal apps. This is by far the best but to get full benefit you need to pay for the premium version. It's worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now I am getting Irritating upgrade popups everywhere all the time so now I am downgrading from 5 star to one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"perfect. just what i need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Almost perfect, but is it safe? If it uses Google Drive, and Google had a privacy issues in the past, how I can be sure my data is untouchable? Probably I can't. For a trip/journey moments and for other things it is very nice app, but for diary, I mean real sensative data, I have doubts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good stuff, does what it says on the tin. Bumped up to 5 because its so simplre and the free version is non intrusive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very handy for keeping my dreams everyday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"this could be a five star rating if it wasnt for all the ""buy this"" pop ups. The subscription/fee is not very clear. uou install it and there is something about a 7 day free trial. Then you can go to setting and get a one tine premium purchase, or do a subscription. but not really sure how that impacts the 7 day free trial. the menu to navigate is a little odd. but overall i ha e used it a number of times and I like how it is working for now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The full screen request to upgrade each time you open the app is ruined this beautiful app. It's extremely irritating. Every single time you open the app, they will ask you to upgrade. Irritating the user to the point that they may uninstall and go for another alternative which are plenty in playstore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"it requires you too pay to take notes this is all people who want to squeze money out of you have fun paying to write notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Love the app! Alittle costly but really like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"pop up for offers ads at every screen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Was highly impressed when I re-downloaded the app after close to 2 years of abandoning it and found all my old entries waiting for me... And with the pictures. The nostalgia I felt prompted me to purchase the premium version, which I must say, is a dime well spent. The 'atlas' feature gives an added incentive to make entries while traveling. I'm still trying to figure out how to get my Google Fit data integrated into the app. It says I can."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"incredible and beautiful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"paid option not good us."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this journal very useful as it encourages me to record details of important events, which, with my bad memory I would surely forget. Top marks for its layout and ease of use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"transcendent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok I'm no geek. Just want retrievable daily thoughts. No problems at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great for chronicling your life as it goes. You can add pictures, times, and locations. You can also see all the pics on a map and select them to read past entries and look at the pics. Excellent!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had been using for past 2 years. It had got so many features that make you write your journal daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love the ease of use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Daily reminder notification makes it easy. Voice to text works great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very nice application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps keep life in order and Goals in focus"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Last year my goal was to write a journal so I could remember what I did but also to just write more. After the birth of my daughter I started using this again and it's a great app for a quick journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good app, but ads for premium show up waayyyy too much.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I decided to buy premium because I enjoyed using the app. However, even though I have paid for it and gotten the receipt, my app still has not been upgraded to premium. Very disappointed and dissatisfied."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Thank you so much for this really handsome app! I miss some features due to purchasing the premium... the customer contact regarding fixing some bugs and making useful changes out of feedback occured to me slightly disappointing.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Other than loads and loads of promotinal ads I think this app is a wonderful tool to save your memories to cherish them later on in life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've gone through many, "" journals apps,"" and like this one the most"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that it works with All my other apps and programs..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App does exactly what it says and though I use it for work as a business journal, and not for personal use so much, it performs great. Easily conforms to what I need on the job. Almost entirely glitch free. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is very good for daily journaling and offers a number of simple yet easy to use features. It is straightforward and not over complicated and allowes password protection, geo tagging, photos, etc. The only thing I don't like is the annual subscription feature but I dis end up paying for the premium features (one time payment) to unlock a few of the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal for your phone, back it up so you don't lose it all if you're phone breaks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. I can use it as much or little as I want. Great functionality. Good payment options if you want to upgrade from basic version. It is totally usable without upgrading. Nice added features if you do though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Missed the one time purchase option rather than subs. This makes this a great app for what my daily journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app for years. I still love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love writing down my thoughts /daily adventures on the app. It's easy to pull them up on my different devices. Pretty easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has played a very important role in my mental health ... allows me to highlight hi's and lows and work out trigger points and dates"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Great app - will there be future support for multiple journals?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for a journal, can add pictures and media. Great help"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very good app. The dark theme is great. Syncs a bit slowly but works. Smoothly adds images to the diary. The only competitor to this app is Diaro. Have used the paid versions of both and have settled in with this one for a while now. Try it out, it's worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice tool to keep your Jornal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I need to journal as part of my recovery and for my general well-being; this app makes it easy. The reminders are nice and its very user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me to clear my head"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wish I could save more than 10 min audio with premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Must have on my devices and its fun!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to collect thoughts and make notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app. It makes keeping a short journal easy, and it let's me incorporate photos and videos. I like the reminders and the throwback entries. I've recommend this app to friends."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"keep up with the good work!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful app. I like the layout and the fact that you can add small details like location, what you're doing at the time, and your mood. User-friendly and syncs perfectly across platforms (I'm an Android and Windows user)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is worth it!!!! I started with the free version, because I wanted somewhere to just jot down ideas/ chronicle my day/ Etc. That was great, had no struggles using the app or anything. Nice too, if I missed a day I could go back to input the information. I realized I'm a visual=memory kind of person, so I upgraded to the ""pay once, unlocked for life"" plan. Being able to add pictures is so awesome!! Not only am I able to capture ideas, I can add a snapshot of that moment in time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and secure"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well for me, enjoying it a lot!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, very easy to take notes and journal. Markdowns however are a bit need getting used to, and fingerprint now works great, (this app had issues with reading fingerprint, but now they have fixed it. Thank You!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Will change review if they remove aggressive annoyance for ""special offers"" I'm already a paid member to support this developer. Yet more offers that cannot be disabled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and reliable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Despite the free desktop version is very clunky and I wish I could use it, I enjoy the mobile app as it allows me to quickly add notes, memories snd photos. To facilitate things even more it would be nice to have it ask you right away on load what's on my mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is the best! I love how it reminds me of my past entries. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep records of your life..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me write down my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Paid version too expensive!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only disruptive ad is the upgade to premium , which i expect using the free part. But besides that , this app is great for all my daily prayers , journalling and photo journals. Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very good to have a very good journal and it can be a useful almanac of memories also.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great for homeschool portfolio"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, simple UI but sufficient. Very happy to find a Linux version. On the downside I find the various offerings a little confusing: I thought I'd paid for full x-platform access, yet I keep getting in-app offers for another version - sort the paid tiering/features out, filter users who already have paid or at least provide some clarification and I'd have no quibbles at all. Now I just need to make better use of it!  UPDATE: to clarify - the membership tiering info _is_ available in the app. My glitch is that there are periodic pop-ups when I open the app offering. It's no biggie though. App is still recommended :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy i love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to self-reflect."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Even though I bought the app (big mistake) it keeps giving me ads to join their scription services, which would have given me the app for free. I don't recommend getting this app. Look elsewhere. It's missing one key feature. Multiple reminders. Also, wish the mood indicator was more noticeable"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journalling app. The layout and everything is pretty intuitive, and I haven't really encountered any bugs. One thing I'd like to possibly see is a way for us to create and insert our own templates. Every day I like to write down under specific headers what I did yesterday, what I learned, what I think I should've done differently, etc, and I'm forced to copy all that I wrote down the entry before and reuse my headers. It'd be nice to just be able to have a way to paste down my template from one button instead of going through the process of opening my previous entry, copy pasting it into my current entry, and then replacing the body with my current entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is really good but i want this app to be for atleast next 30 years or life time can i trust this app ??? I really in need of such a digital diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the interface and the ease of use. This one is a great app to help you make write daily."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"1st time using an app for logging. Working great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best memories EVER.... like a verbal scrapbook. Helpful therapy you can see 👀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't dream of a better app. Everything I need: no ads, accessible from both phone or desktop, I can search my enteries. I just love it. Thank you so much developers team."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's perfect!! Just.... They could tone down a little on the ad for the paid version? It's understandable, but appearing everytime you do something is a little overwhelming."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, hope to buy premium some day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. So does my a psychiatrist"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Journal app their is!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm so happy to have found this app! Been journaling for more than 20 yrs but had done it less and less these past few years. I've rediscovered my love for journaling. 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice journal Still would love to see some added features free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a wonderful tool. I even use it to track my work progress. If you're creative, you can put it to good use...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I changed to this journaling app because of the ability to attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"really like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I personally prefer writing for the clarity of thought it brings and this is exactly what I wanted! Can sync across devices and premium version can also let me export the entries. And UI is absolutely awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Switched from Diaro because I can add pics to my entries with journey. Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good journal app with lots of features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app with great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. The pop ups for buying the full version are a little annoying but it's a good app so I'll consider buying it. The password function is great for privacy if someone is snooping around on your phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it for keeping track of our family activities!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Exactly what I was looking for. :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm enjoying this app very much"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Is there any way to add a password instead of a passcode? I really don't like that I am instantly signed into my journal by clicking my g oogle account...what if someone else did? There is no option to input the passcode for the web version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling and sticking with the version I have backed up. They've got greedy and now bombarding with popups to upgrade, now unusable. Version 2.1 is available on apkmirror which is much better. Response: I know I haven't purchased the app, you currently offer a free service that is limited in content to persuade people to upgrade. I'm telling you that you have gone from persuading to pestering and your free version is now unusable. To avoid one star reviews dial back the ransom reminders or either completely remove free version. I'm happy with version 2.1 till you make a decision."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app, it is easy to understand."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am happy to have a password protected journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Clean interface design which makes it easy on the eyes. I like cross-compatibility aspect. Journaling for just 5 minutes per day provides a great release valve on all of the stressors of the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love writing in my journal for a few minutes at a time. Really convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sad, Wordpress uploading is not working properly since last update. Hopefully it will get fixed soon, is mostly what I use it for. Will update with awesomeness as soon as it's fixed. - Update Dec 10,2018: Everything works perfectly now! Thank you so much, no clue what went on but everything is as amazing as always! You truly don't value stuff until it's gone. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to keep up with journaling, especially when traveling. I especially enjoy that the app adds little details to my entries like the location and weather."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Yes a very good app for personal dairy wrtting"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a very consistent app... I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just love this app! It is so fulfilling and easy to use! By far, one of my faves!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've used this app for a couple of weeks as a visual home education record for my kids. The search function is awesome for this when using hashtags with my entries. I would pay for it, but it appears I have to sign in with Google for that and I am currently removing Google from my life. Stuck with my Android for now...will I have to lose this app when I finally get a new phone?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app with mood control and multiplatform support"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nice app. But last update totally awfullest advertising-forced annoying thing i ever saw in apps. -5 strars!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love how everything is so easy to find!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like entry, date setting, export options, and that I can use it on mobile and desktop."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app. But it'd be cool if I could search my content to find something in the past that I'd like to read."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far it's ok I haven't deleted it yet so that's a good thing.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for those that want to keep track of their activities without using public social media."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I enjoy playing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great little app for a gratitude journal. The daily reminder is really helpful and it's fun to look back on what you've written over the last few months or years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The markdown support is absolutely killer. It allows me to write even when I don't have the app handy and know I can put it in. I love having formatted journal entries, and I love that I can have a template I use every day that looks correct and fill it in (I use google keep to store the templates because they don't support that yet). The app works great, it's sync'd on my chromebook, ipad, iphone, and mac at work and my mac at home, so I love having access to all my information and I love that it's all available offline. Even the web view is useful (as that's how I started using it daily). I really love the app, and I'm looking forward to template support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome. Everything I was looking for"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used to write diaries. After getting this app i shifted to digital.very simple to use and I loved this app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app for day to day use. Using for one year now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Apps is good but its only save 4 images in one section.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself is great yet it has started to bother me with some membership offers despite the fact that I have the premium version…"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It really helps me to keep a current journal rather than inconsistent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such an easy app to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly, paid for android version but have to pay another time for iOS for same user account. Feel unjustified."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Recommend for person who want to write diary. Easy to use, good ui and ux."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app a lot. UI is clean, it's simple to use and it backs up your entries to a cloud. My last phone unexpectedly died on me and I was able to recover the old entries I had made. It's worth the money to remove ads! It's never crashed on me either."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, I Love it...."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this handy journal and the ability to lock my personal thoughts!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for keeping a Journal. I just wish the desktop app was less expensive, especially when there is a free online version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It did not fit my subjective expectation. But that is hardly your problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it and it help to record my life story."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Super easy to record daily entries!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very usefull app to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that I can write my thoughts down at anytime I want. All because of the good Lord loving me, I can do this! Praise God!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Please glad that it's voice recognition don't know if I can print it out we'll see"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app. Just what I needed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great app that can be used easily and useful for keep tracking of yourself and everything you want"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm new using this app. I like it so far. It has abilities to edit the date & time, adding pics when I forgot to jot down the diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Outstanding in all the fundamental ways a diary/journaling app should be. I don't give 5Star rating but rarely. I stayed at 4Stars for 2(½?) reasons. I'm not looking for MS Word here, but perhaps just a little in it's formatting features ... 1) I'd appreciate it's Rich Text Formatting options more flushed out than the bare Markdown that often presents as a (**code**/WYSIWYG-hybrid). I realize that it's even there is more than most diary/journal apps, but it is a differentiating feature set for my writing. 2) I'd prefer to have more control over the Edit screen's text zoom/scaling as smaller print on small screens with big fingers makes for tedious editing. ½?) I think this may be a bug/conflict from the Google Keyboard I use, but after a longer season and editing with what M↓ it has, the keyboard will go ""berserk"" as in a state of semi-crashing with it's cashed keystrokes (incl section Deletes, Returns, etc.) injecting themselves in spurts seconds later. I'm on a Note9, so hardware mem shouldn't be an issue. Happy to revise/upgrade Rating if I'm shown something I missed $/or indeed is what I'm looking for is added."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Helps me compose emails, posts, and lists to remember things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have returned to give you the updated review. The app is much better that so many features were added since I've reviewed this app in 2016. I applaud you on the changes you've made, and that you've added the audio feature that I've requested. It helps when I try to describe something. Now I have 2 requests that you might be considering. One is the title-bar. so that I can title the journal entry rather than putting the title in the page itself. And the other is considering the catagories so keep the journal entries more organized. :) Thank you for honoring my last request, and thank you for the hard work you've done. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient. I just hope it backs all my data up in case I change, format or lose my phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's ""OK"" at best. I just seem to keep finding features that it lacks. Plus, I'm tired of it begging me to pay it. Edit:downgraded to 1 star because this review was replied to with a request to upgrade. Lol wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sometimes there are thoughts in my head that's hard to share with people, this app is the solution 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The app doesnt have landscape mode, at least is not working for me while every other app does. If this gets resolved i will update my review"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"awesome app... people like me need it... this app helps me alot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Minimalistic and functional to my needs. Great work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great!! love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First review on any app EVER, I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"False advertisement. Says it's $2.49 on their website and I had to pay £3.69 which is about $5 for 1 MONTH!!! Forget it, way too pricey for what it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, the name is perfect. Life is a journey and all journeys deserve to be recorded!! This app is there for me to open upy point of the day for me to write down how I am interpreting my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well designed. Very useful. Some suggestions later, after I use it more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like have a place to easily write my thoughts without having to carry around a diary. I also like the reminders. Perfect app for my needs. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it, wish I could access on my desktop. Other then that it is GREAT."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it is a good app but it would become better if we can able to flip the photos on the main page. The app asked me to upgrade for Premium but actually I had upgraded already and I supposed it's for lifetime. Is there any problem? After a period of time, I noticed my a/c premium status was removed and I needed to uninstall the app and reinstall the app through my computer. What is the cause of such problem? It's pretty annoying that my premium a/c is being removed from time to time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Please stop pestering me to upgrade to premium every time I open the application. I have already bought it for my Mac at home. Seriously, a decent application with irritating nagging. Okay, so I upgraded to Premium and it has now started nagging, each time I open the application, to upgrade to the lifetime membership plan.... seriously, appalling lack of respect for the user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Loved the fact that i can sync my notes across devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoyed this app, it's so easy and so useful. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I have this for iOS too before I switched to Android. Seamless transition between the two platforms thanks to cloud sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app I've come across."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's helpful to take notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this as a personal & business diary. It's easy to attach info & map locations to media...and changing times and dates to bring everything into the actual timeline of events is fantastic. I love this app :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am very happy to find this app. Loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I still love the app. The new theme updates are amazing!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick and easy way to jot down my daily reflections. Love it!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use - I don't use all the features but it does what I want it to without having to think about it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I gave this app a five-star because they deserve it. It has so many features even in its free-version that's very much useful. Also, the best part of the app is it's free. That in itself helps so much especially with people like me just looking for a decent journalling app wherein upgrading to premium really just depends on my needs. What I'm saying is that upgrading to premium really is just an option depending on your needs and not compulsory after a week of free trial membership like other crappy business-minded journal apps. I sincerely hope the developers of this app continue to let it stay that way because it's such a great help and would totally recommend it to other people. Kudos to the developers of this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the first that I've truly loved a new app in long time. It's a concise easy way to write down daily thoughts and it delivers. I've never before journaled, and doing this was recommended to me as good way to find appreciation in my everyday life. What I find easy about this experience is that I can just open the app and dictate my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just needed a journal to keep track of thoughts and events, and this app does a fine job. I can adjust date, time and location, and can type or dictate, so I'm satisfied. Update Dec 2018: still using it, still loving it. Thought I'd lost everything when my phone died, but it's all still here and my saga continues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a good basic journal. Wish it had a good search and hashtag feature. Also, would like more apps to share like FB. The video entry looks like a picture wish it had a video icon to know its a video entry. Thanks. Premium user."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A journal and adding photos video etc. Very pleased with this app, thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's useful to keep secrets in this app!I think everyone should download it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a great app for journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app for journaling. However, for my purposes it comes up short on reviewing what you've journaled. I'd like better search functionality"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the app and how easy it is to journal. I wish the mood tracker was a little more intuitive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use if just writing or adding your pictures to your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There should have a reminder facility"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great outlet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app, but I've been getting ads for the paid version every time I open it recently, which is definitely annoying. Otherwise, no complaints."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Bought the premium version. Just one question do you have the option to record audio? I am not able to find it. If its not there now are you planning to implement it near future?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey have been improved a lot. I like the latest design and features. Very usefull and beneficial to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use diary, synched between different platforms. Option to export. I love it, I have been using this for long."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The information contained therein or for instances beyond our control and prevention."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to use across multiple platforms. Simple and handy to use. They don't tell you anywhere u have to pay for the pc version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice note-taker, easy to access and save and search. Happy to have downloaded this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and friendly app to tract ideas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app. I love the design and layout and how it can tell if you're sitting still or driving. And also you can attach pictures? I'm never writing manually for a journal again. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this for quick notes, snapshots, shower thoughts. Ideal quick journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I actually use this app to help track my daily pain so I have a log when I visit my Rhumetologist it's really nice because it shows the weather and I can rate my pain on the happiness scale. Perfect for what I need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app. Very feature rich and accessible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use the app as a replacement for my paper journal (pretty much text only) and it fits the bill perfectly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app really helps me I have needed it as a dump journal and it's just amazing. I use the free version and it is sufficient for me. Love this app!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing app. I found it to help me realize things about my life when I look back and things that I can learn going forward. I do hate the ads so all ads to me are useless. But I just won't pay for the had feature premium I paid for this app but not the full because I just not going to pay that much just to get rid of some ads. Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Super annoying ""buy premium"" notifications every time you open app, create a new entry, etc. I understand that this is the way they make money, but seeing the notification every time I do something even though I don't want any of the premium features is unnecessary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it handles the basics. I haven't yet figured out how to use the premium features(just went premium today)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love this app I don't have time to write I love being able to speak what I need to say."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i found it very easy to start with, it was just what I was looking for. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and I love to make a photo the centerpiece of my entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love writing and this is all I ever wanted💗"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps for keep record my daily journal. Easy to use interface. Work really fast on my Galaxy S8 love function to attched photo or assign mood to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple journal entry system. I bought the android app and the cloud platform is free, which I use as well. Functional but not feature rich. I would like the option to pay a larger fixed price amount to unlock applications on all platforms rather than having to buy them individually or pay the recurring subscription cost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best journal apps, I've seen around on the store. Many functionalities and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's an awesome app! I loved it.. because I share everything with my diary and its the best companion when I am alone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply perfect. Incredibly intuitive with the ability to add images, this app has been great for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I need a place where I can express those deep thoughts about me and things in life. This is what this app is!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Adding encryption feature like penzu would be fantastic."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well for me on all my devices and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A good app very easy to use. I like to use it to document my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for diary, from the calendar mode we can write and put photos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the idea of journaling. I definitely want to make this a habit. Supposedly that takes 66 days in a row, to make it a habit. We'll see if I can get to that. This app has a lot of great features. I love being able to attach pictures and that it adds place and time, as well as weather. Great App!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Suka banget dengan desain nya yang simple."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job as should be doing. A very good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great apps, worthy of upgrade version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It has a very simple interface and is easy to use. I like the mood tracker function and the fact that you can set reminders. You can also add pictures and other media to your entries. There are other functions such as PIN protection but I don't find I need it since my phone itself is PIN protected. Haven't upgraded to the paid version, and don't feel the need to. Though I might in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for people who record every events.😀 Updated version is awesome.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far the app performs really well. I would have been nice to have 1 or 2 premium options to try before purchase."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its a good App, It gets the job done, But theres a lot of room to improve. My biggest complain is that thee is no spell check. Fonts are limited and i just feel theres room to grow. That being said i use it every day and what it does it does very well. It has helped me write my journal and syncs perfectly with my phone. It backs up to Google drive and it works great. All i realy want from it is the ability to integrate it with gramarly and honestly it ca use themes. Other than that great job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like....."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yes I love this app I don't write daily but when I do my last writing is there with all my other writing history this is so great.Thanks for a great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"The only problem is that it keeps reminding you to put something, anything in all the time. If you want your phone to go off, reminding you every few seconds then this is for you. I had to uninstall it just to get a break. Not putting it on again. Yeuch."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Multi practical function with simple UI, very easy to get used to it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would give 5 stars but: Great app, used it for some time now , I went pro but when will we be able to edit the tags? How do I delete / archive tags?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Been using paid version for almost two years now. No issues whatsoever. Rare these days... If you're looking to keep a digital log of places and events I highly recommend."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is too difficult to format text."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Truly amazing and helpful. Well done guys and keep doing the awesome. And be generous like you ask for. For being, I'm sure you'll get that in return. 😜😋😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it thanks for this really helped"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Hi, so I installed this app yesterday. Since I'm allowed to upload videos I was thinking, oh, this would be a nice way to make a video diary. I bought the upgrade to see if the maximum size of a video would increase a bit, but it didnt... I cant upload videos that are more than a minute after editing them a little... I dont think I'm going to continue this, but only because of that. I mean all in all, this app is ingenious, but the video attachment option could be upgraded a bit to allow for slightly larger files with the purchase of an upgrade. 😟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love that you can add pictures!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is joyous."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would like to be able to batch select Photos from Google Photos but not bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I paid for premium. I wish the themes were a bit more customizable but it is a great journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I was after! Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app for personal journal. Syncs with Google. Secure with passcode. Location. Pictures. Words. Exactly what I was looking for."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"the app can't login gmail"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Allows me to skip social media..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I'm not able to upgrade it. Please fix it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is really helpful in creating memories for future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used it for years, very happily. Having reloaded it on a new phone, a review request came up. So, 5 stars. If I have a grudge it is that the premium licence which I have for phone does not cover my laptop as well, you need two .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a well-built simple journaling app. It's worth the upgrade to at least the one time premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me live healthier"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Someone Always There to Listen! I like this app especially because during the day at work I have so much to say but no one that I feel I can trust to share it with! So I can just pull up my Journey and talk about it with someone that I can trust...lol. Me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great depositary for off the cuff thoughts and ideas!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have tried many app's like this well worth the money to step up to Premium account."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and minimalist. Works well.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, no complaints! If im using this long enough, will probably buy the premium version"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so much !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice that I can add pics to my notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Every time your open the app it pushes you to the ""go premium"" screen. EVERY SINGLE TIME. And also after you enter a journal. Annoying. Finding a different app for journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"it is a good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Looking forward to the function of fingerprint unlocking"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've been nervous about traveling around with my paper journal. I mean, how humiliating and sad if I lost it in public, right? also, I think much faster than I can write so this app is nice...I can use speak-to-text to dictate my thoughts. I paid the one-time fee to be ad free. I do wish it was truly ad free. The ads asking me to upgrade to a paid monthly subscription is still an intrusive ad every other time I open the app and I paid for NO ads. Other than that ,awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This app has some great features and allows me to enter notes and entries with photos and videos. Very convenient and really easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wish it had an easier to view monthly calendar within the main page that pulls up with the red + for new additions."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app literally saved my life. Having a convenient app to journal my thoughts is helping me tremendously. Keep up the great work guys👍❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Since I got this app, i started to write my journal almost everyday. In the bus, before going to sleep. Also manage to record those lightning ideas that only last 5 sec. And because of the different categories, it's easy to organise all the different types of thoughts. Moreover the multimedia attachments are simple to add. Finally I love the simple design and the affordable cost."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Posting to Instagram would be better if more than just the picture posted.... No text at all comes through. I have to copy/pasta. BUT, I really like all the other features! Been looking for something this cool for a while. Exceeds my expectations!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely changed my life and that sounds exaggerated but it changes how I remember things and gives me time to think for myself. It's amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Price is too high. Need modifications. Lower the price."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Price is high"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Price is too high.....why to increase!!??"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've got the full version and I love it! I've always loved journaling and having this app is a super convenient way to write down the little happy moments in life I don't want to forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app is it daily for work hours The location and log in time really helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"This journal app has zero pen/drawing input which makes it basically useless for diary /Journaling. It's super rigid in its structure."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is it possible to connect another Google Fit account that's not used for Journey?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me in so many personal ways. Its helping change my entire life for the better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life changing. Life inspiring."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love having a diary and love looking back to see what I did last year. Journey is the perfect app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Looking for a simple app to journal. But from get go got bombarded with ads to upgrade. Night mode is a paid feature? No, thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app, but I would love it more if it allowed us to upload more than 4 pictures/videos"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can it export to Dropbox?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Started using the app a few weeks ago. Checking back to my earlier entries, I notice a whole week of data in the middle of my entries is gone, then later two days, makes for 9 days in under a month gone! Bug with syncing?! I use both Android app and cloud app which stays open sometimes, maybe this causes issues? Either how, losing that much data is enough to make me lose all trust in this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The Best❤❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i've been using this app for almost two years now. the app has a very neat look and it is generally easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the trick. Easy to use. Good that you keep the data in Google drive and don't have yet another data store to worry about"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Serves me right"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app was what I needed. I have anxiety and stress and work in a highly stressful work environment. I wanted to start journaling again but I. Didn't want to do it on paper because I have nosey children and I don't want my husband to read things when I just need to be ugly and vent. It has a password and it syncs to my account. I needed this as I sometimes break my phone and don't want to lose my data. It's a good app so far!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only been using it for 2 days, but do far so good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is sensational. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Available across several platforms, inexpensive, makes journaling easy."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this App daily, it has helped me to write everyday. I set my alarm for the perfect time daily and I haven't missed a day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better than a pen and paper journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it..awsum"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and useful in more ways than I tjought."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yet to use all the features, but.able to use it intuitively. That is very much appreciated. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. I'm using it to journal daily life experiences."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the simplicity, the reminders, and the ability to publish. I will take a photo and write short thoughts while on the go on my phone or sit at my PC and write a long entry. The sync feature is awesome and works flawlessly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best thing about this app is that I can dictate into my journal and not having my hand feel like it's going to fall off after writing so much. I would recommend this app to anyone who'd want to keep a diary even if it is in your phone because you have a password before opening it it's really awesome thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Worth paying for the premium version, happy to be able to sync across multiple devices"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app for sermon notes whenever God gives me a new word. I also use it to chronicle events."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent App, love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"been using it since 2015. lovely and very great. love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Even though the application seems awesome, pretty much everything useful is ""locked"" and you need to buy the subscription. I get it, you guys need to make money. I'm willing to pay for something useful. But if there isn't an unrestricted trial version of at least a few days, there's no way I will know whether or not it fits my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love journaling with pics, vids and text as often as I want! It's a great way to keep tabs on self-development!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy and simple to use and practical to the right needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome app. I would have given it 5 star if Google could provide separate secure storage for journaling instead of counting it against the Google drive storage. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty superb so far out of the gate. I've been routinely journaling since getting the App, and this is the first approach to both digital and traditional journaling that doesn't feel like a chore I have to talk myself into doing, simply to give up on or forget about just a week or 3. It does everything that it does well and in an intuitive configuration. There are a fair amount of cool little features that even of you choose not to use, in no one clutter the knterphase or make it confusing. HOWEVER It does need a couple obvious things. The first one that comes to mind is being able to have more than one journal going at once, or at least like a sub-folder kind of thing. I may want a public journal and a seperate private one for example. Also, why would an app like this not have at least some kind of bare bones social networking features...?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, share, and print."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy journal to use. Bought the upgrade, very happy with it!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for journalling"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'll enjoy these things later. I appreciate the ease."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I Love It"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. Its the best journal I've ever used."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Even the free version is very easy to use and attaching photo or other files is very simple. A great online diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"If you like to journal or keep a diary, then you MUST get this app. You can share outside entries and have them go directly to this app. I couldn't possibly be without it. 100% must have!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Ad pop-ups too frequent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Totally satisfied"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, so good, for my current use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I found this app through a newspaper article. This was not a new year resolution but always wanted to journal. Been almost 2 years and I have developed the habit of writing irregularly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use across multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Expensive and going too delete it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice aap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's a convenient app for journalling, but the formatting options are very limited. They have a Markdown option, where you can use syntax and then the text is formatted, but the formatting is not that user friendly, and you can't highlight. I wouldn't recommend buying Premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek and user friendly. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice place to keep my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No ads! I didn't upgrade but will soon. This is really good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for jotting down a life journey. Attach photos. Record weather. Location. Mood. Activity. Does a good job of keeping everything organised and together for self reflection."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very flexible and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to add photos, location notes, emojis and more!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seems cool"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"They try to push the upgrade feature quite often. Otherwise, great! Don't need to pay anything."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"PAID ONLY. Free to download, but no free version offered for use, not even a trial. UPDATE: Developer replied, said there is in fact a free version. But I was prompted to upgrade to paid premium, in order to save the first & only entry I attempted. Mind you, I attempted to save this entry multiple times, being prompted to upgrade each time, resulting in the inability to save an entry, therefore making this app FREE ONLY TO DOWNLOAD, on my phone at least. LG Stylo 4, Android 8.1"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Na"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not working in miui10"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fast and reliable no matter what platform I use! I have never lost an entry yet (even if it crashes, or gets interrupted by another app, etc.) It's so incredibly efficient! It has helped Me ditch the physical journals :') Physical ones are great, except for being cumbersome. So I'm ditching them for this. JOURNEY is a bit less personal (it's not my handwriting), but it helps Me minimize my stuff. Besides I could put photos and attachments to it. Thanks and congrats to the Journey team =')"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely an easy way to make sure I get those precious moments written down. I don't always have my book journal with me, but the phone is! I have yet to see how printing it turns out."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and simple to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fast and effective tool for writing down thoughts on the go, has changed my journalling experience in a positive way."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Introverted Life Hack: If you can actually land a date with someone you think you'd like but they obviously aren't, then pretend to be texting someone else a super important text while they're talking but you're really just writing complaints about them and their awful date in today's second journal entry about your pitifully lonesome lovelife. You can write about any other subject too though if you really want to, I guess..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great features and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful Journal/Timeline App!! I've tried a lot of journal apps, and this one has me writing and adding photos!! I NEVER pay for apps, but I paid for this one!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The interface is OK, and it works OK. In use I liked the free version. But beware that it is hard to remove the software (uninstall does not work), and you are not able to delete your account. When you want to switch to another journal app, it is not easy to export your entries (you can in the paid version)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app, it help you write words when you need to, a good diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for short notes and pics."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have installed pro version of journey.. it's a very useful app to save your memories and happiness in one go.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is good and adding video to journal entries is a bonus. One thing I still miss from Day One is the ability to have multiple journals under same account. This way I can separate work from personal etc. I use the Premium edition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using it to track my medical situation. Very helpful at doctor visits. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, use it all the time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journalling is good for your sanity. Get going. Great app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app! Very useful and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best note apps, i used this as daily diaryand mood diary and its all cool."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Other journal Apps don't compare to this one. I wanted me something simple and easy to write my thoughts down. Nothing to fancy... This is the one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"What a great intuitive app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy fun and secure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems to be what I was looking for. Like it very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Liked it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used the app for just over a month before upgrading to premium. I use it mainly to jot down events for my son's milestones and what sold me was the fact that they have a throwback feature! It's honestly better than any other baby milestone app I've tried! I do use it as a journal as well and I find the night mode was definitely nice touch!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good. However, it could be better to have a list of location we use more often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very useful to me as I often need a quick place to record in journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am really enjoying this app. A feature upgrade could be to have emojis. I would like a medicine bottle so I can use it as a reminder that I've taken my medicine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"if you like simple easy to use apps, get this one now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"BLOAT so uninstalling till fixed; ie sd card instal iption for us opted in by dev"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It allows me to pour my all out and not be judged. Tracking moods and everything is amazing. I am looking forward to new features. Keep up the great work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app it has made diary keeping that much easier... My only problem is the constant pestering to upgrade to premium. I understand occasionally advertising but everytime I log in or log an entry feels a bit excessive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I often joke about writing something in my journal when something incredible happens. I find myself more and more actually doing it because of this app. Having this outlet to record events and thoughts and to reflect upon has been very calming."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, and awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Trying to journal more. This app helps. They added some new features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I like this app and even bought the PC version but the amount of notifications about the Premium account drives me mad and I started thinking about switching to something else. No, I'm not interested now, do I really need to repeat this choice every time I open the app?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fabulous diary app. Have put it on my front page so that I use it everyday. That's my highest compliment, being put on the first page of my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the most amazing app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is great and easy to use. Kudos devs, you guys done a good job. I only have Rs. 200 in my Google pay balance. I'll surely purchase it if it costs that much only."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's even better than a traditional journal because you can add photos next to your entry. I purchased it and it would be nice if I could do both photos and video for each entry, instead of just one or the other. I am really pleased with it though. Nice app! I love the location feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a blessing to my soul and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"hope it doesn't read what i write"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to journal, life is so busy, but this is a simple way to write something down when I get a little down time. I can write as little, or as much as I like. And because it isn't hand written, I can easily read previous entries- not always true with my other journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"his helps me organize my plans and my direction"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app to record my life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use journal app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it's easy to use and I can attach photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"UPDATE:  Finally got my Premium back and all is good. Love this program!!!  This has been a awesome journal until the latest release. I had the Premium upgrade and with the new release they want me to buy it over again. As a customer since 2015, who uses this every day, it is frustrating to think I need to buy it over again. I have emailed their support and no response. On their frequently asked questions they give a way to restore a purchase but it doesn't work. I will gladly change this back to 5 stars if I can get my purchase back. Sorry to put this out to the public but their support isn't responding!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy format"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The interface is simple, sharing is easy — or don't! — and it has been indispensable in keeping track of myself. Updated Review: I upgraded to the premium features and it has been worth every penny. (Even if my main reason was the night mode lol) Being able to preview my Markdown has been indispensable in entries bound for export. (My only question is whether we will see the ability to use a space mark in our tags; I have a bevy of established tags with and right now tagging is a separate operation.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Seriously... I suggest this app for those who are just eager to write a diary but not able to do so with book and pen. Even some online journals I've tried but not this much easy and well designed... I can concentrate on my content as the app will take care of the rest of the things... Kudos Team... Love you ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the app but man, I like the free version and it's constantly bombarding my screen with pop up ads to upgrade. It's annoying!! Take it down a notch will ya?"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly and easy to navigate through. The notes are easily accessible and can be edited. Pictures can also be added as notes. Love it."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Maybe the paid version is cool, but the free version is pretty weak. Comparable to other note apps. No markdown capability in the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy."

Every now and then I get reminders of what I've written before and I think this is good as I can clearly see how things are changing in my life over time. I thoroughly recommended this app to anyone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"i purchased premium account then i realized later that this is separated purchase for different platform. i can't access premium from my mac. then later i also realized that journey on my android phone didn't support portrait system. or is there any way to make it portrait in android phone?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Something inside of us that rises through the cacophony of conscious and subconscious thought gives us epiphanies at the strangest of times. We are lucky if we can recollect those bits of wisdom in this age of technology that aims to shorten our attention span. The utility of journey is jotting these ideas, moments, sounds, in order to retain insights of our lives in an organized manner to then revisit and develop a narrative thread of our lives. Thank you Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Much better than penzu."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app to quickly record daily experience. Excellent features make it all the more attractive. You gotta pay for many exciting features, but still whatever is given free serves the purpose well enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to used for those who wants to document memories.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I have had this app for ages and kept going to and fro. Now that I am back , I have been using this as the main way to reflect my thoughts and learning process for quite a while now. I am really impressed with how polished the app is now. Testament to keeping that discipline!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a lovely app that does everything it promises and more. Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Has everything I need to get my life journal done. Wish some of the prices were cheaper but so far so good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've started countless journals, both in digital and traditional media, but have never quite stuck to one. I find that this one sticks to me. The user interface is clean and encourages me not to think too much about what I'm writing and just write."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app, Well worth the money"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent for tracking activities and memories."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app overall. Adds for the upgraded version are annoying since I don't want the extra features. I have 2 devices. Because it uses my google login I can keep track of my entrys easily. Makes it easier to make quick entry. Also neat feature is it tracks when you enter your emotions so you can see them on a graph."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cool, the best diary application in Playstore. Nice interface, real time sync, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"#2 Below is my opinion from 2+ years ago, still excellent, still like a nicer font, hehe ☺️ #1Looks hard to improve, but I'm sure they will... thought, maybe a handwriting style font to soften the experience..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"HOW can you get the key board to rotate sideways? My keyboard usually does but on this Ap I can't seem to get it to???"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app for more than 2 years already. Love how simple it is yet powerful in recording my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not many apps make me happy! This is great for daily journaling and or keeping track of your day's activities and thoughts. what I like about this app is that it automatically documents where you're writing what time what's the weather and all of the things that are important plus it doesn't date and time stamp plus you can print what you write and it's just a great all-around app to use for tracking and or journaling your activities I give it an B+"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is so easy and convenient. I love this app. It's so much better than using the traditional journal, and the best part about it is the fact that you can access your recordings, notes and writings online. That's SUPER COOL"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the ease of data entry, and the responsiveness of the app. Thank you! I purchased it, so I can't comment on ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As of 22nd Oct - I think Journey has to look at compatibility issues in chrome and IE. The web interface is working perfectly fine in Fire Fox. The mobile app that I purchased is working very well too. There is huge delay in the letters typed to appear on chrome browser. This was never the case earlier. I even tried to disable all extensions to noavail. even restarting chrome did not help. Hence I turned to internet explorer. Still the same problem and the worst part is all the words are displayed in the reverse order! I wanted to post a screenshot but we don't have an upload button here. However all kept aside, i love this app. Great work developers. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it to journal my thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Efficient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really like this app. I'm a writer and have thousands of those a day. With this I can just as it yo and it does the rest. It records the time allows me to chart what I'm doing and feeling. If I'm at a loss for what to write about it gives me a prompt. I love the tags that low me to mark my entries and the look them up later by the seperate subject alone . The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that I had to pay to have it kn my phone and laptop separately."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app! It is user friendly and the customer service is 5-stars. I try to use it daily and it everything I want and more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely LOVE this app. It's the whole reason i now keep a journal. It's simple and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just want to thanx to this app's developer by adding the capability to automatically backup the diary to google drive. I just so desperate of loosing my diary I wrote before as my phone can't restart anymore. Later I found Journey's developer has added this powerfull feature. Thank you Guys......thank you.....really really thank you ......"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great travel journal. Easy to add pictures if recent. Otherwise it's a pain trying to add new pictures, but not necessarily recent. You have to go through file structure and find new, but not recent pictures. Also, you can't choose cover picture for your post. It limits to one video, or 10 pictures for premium version. It would be nice not to have this limitation. Overall, good, though not perfect. Could be improved."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just an excellent app 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and had some decent analytics? Backs up very easily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"easy to used even u changed your smartphone.."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great to transfer to other programs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It has been crashing a lot lately: maybe connected to tagging posts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app. Quite stable. Has seperate licenses for desktop, Android and Google Chrome. A monthly and annual subscription is also available. Would like to see features like immediate sync, encryption of synced data, to be able to sync to any cloud service provider - like Dropbox (presently Google Drive only)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love Journey it is a great app I couldn't do what I used to do without it it is awesome I love it Hello Kitty"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Stop with the ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Made the mistake if upgrading and now there's a permanent ad in the interface. Incredible amount of water space on the screen. Wish I hadn't bought the desktop version. Unhappy customer will be finding another app to work with. App fails to add multiple pictures when you try to share them - quiet failure ensures that you don't know you wasted your time. Bad interface for choosing location for entries means something like 10 clicks every time you need to make an entry for a location other than the one you're in at the time. Constant upsell and irritation. Clunky interface. Don't waste your time like I did."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice to use. Fast and easy to use as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"many times it is quite difficult to remember the place exactly that we visited in the past. tagging places , pictures and time is really great to recollect our memories and helpful to visit them again easily. Recommend to show the current location in atlas view as i have to open google maps in parallel to see where i am exactly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app a lot. I have using it for the past couple of years. It's very convenient that you can write wherever you are, and it gets synced. I would love to pay for a premium version, but it's still too expensive right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one Export option can be developed for all the pages with a single pdf file"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great, I love the tag option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A highly functional app with a beautiful interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for building agendas for meetings with associates and motivating me to work on my goals. And for capturing ideas on the fly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Neat little app, easy to use, does not crash in my experience. Wonder if it may be possible for a user to make some sort of template to monitor tasks etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wow I'm so glad! This app is so cute and very useful! If you love to write 📝 I recommend this app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the app a lot! It's easy to use. I wish the spellcheck was a bit better. More Importantly, I wish I could dictate and not just write. But I am not willing to pay for the upgraded version. It serves my needs well enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the only electronic diary that I have been ok with using on an extended basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I want to upgrade but unable because I don't use internet banking. What are other modes of payment?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. Not ad heavy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is fantastic to record all your wonderful travel memories. It has an easy interface, heaps of useful tools and is a pleasure to use.

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've journalled for years with paper diaries and that was fine but I am enjoying using this app doing it online. It meant I could journal while on a business trip abroad without having to take a bulky physical diary. I like the way it's just simple and non-fussy...For me, the whole point of this activity is to live a more reflective life to the glory of God and bells and whistles are not needed for this so this app gets a full 5 stars from me! Please don't add too much to it 😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps. It is easy. It is needed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfect for jotting down important memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I'm unable to use the app on PC despite of having purchased the lifetime premium pack. I get greeted by a dialog prompting me to purchase the premium via PayPal (which I already have). Pointless if I can't even use it on PC."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for to have my private Journal, contains everything I need and it is super easy to use. Thanks"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent integration between android and mac. Makes it easy to keep a journal consistently. Adding pictures and locations is very useful. Tagging entries is excellent, search function is superb. Affordable premium feature purchase, I am not in for subscription services, I left DayOne app because most of their features went into subscription mode. Backups to google drive is good. I haven't tried printing out entries although expect it to be good. Features I would really like to see: options for fonts, easier formatting of text, adding check boxes."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I bought the pro version of the App but it doesn't sink with the laptop version and it doesn't allow to download your entries in a form that is remotely useful. I asked clarification about the difference between the two version and was ready to buy bought if that was needed, but never got a reply. Don't waste your money"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice please download this Awesome app"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Multiple font styles are required."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I was excited to try this out as I am always looking for a better way to deal with my electronic journals and such. I was willing to pay the $6.99 that upgraded to premium, but wanted to check that I could sink it with my 2 other devices. I'm glad I waited since finding it in Windows I would have had to pay an additional $17.99 to even install it on the computer. I'm not about to lay to install one app on every device. I've never even encountered an app that wants you to pay for every download. So I go back to looking..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Guys is the permanent ""Let's upgrade"" notification at the bottom not enough ? Why do i have to be constantly bombarded by upgrade messages when I'm trying to add a simple entry ? Maybe you should have kept this model paid only from the very start. Atleast then i would have had the option whether or not to adopt your ecosystem. Now it just feels like a slap in the face for being a free user. Edit: As the developers of the app you guys should know that this isn't a paid only app. I know this because I've been using its basic functionalities for years now without paying anything. Just like i use Google's basic services without paying anything. Nice of you to move around my main issue though. If you wanted paid users only maybe you should have kept it that way from the start and not adopt this bait and switch methodology. And finally, as a developer myself i fully appreciate the time and effort that goes into making an app like this, but as a user i despise developers who first bait users into using their platform, and then act like they hold the higher moral ground for demanding money for their efforts that they initially offered for free. Edit : in app purchases are optional. Do you guys even know how your own app works ? How was i able to create 500+ entries over the past 3 years if it was paid ? Anyway, its all moot now. Because of your courteous replies, i decided to delete all of my 3+ years of memories stored on this app and leave your ecosystem for good. To new beginnings 🍻"

Less is more, guys. Please kill this feature or at very least, if my settings have notifications disabled, then DON'T SEND ME NOTIFICATIONS. Thanks."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I don't use it enough. It's wonderful to read past entries and see old photos related to your entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the simplicity of using this to keep a journal. So easy I am encouraged to make an entry whenever I feel like it at a moment's notice."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good better than expected considering they offer kinda pricey packages"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it so far, but I wish I can put gif emojis on my entries without it starting a brand new entry. Also, it would be nice to have stickers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I do not regret my choice of Journey. I celebrate it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not sure about ads since I paid for premium off the bat, but I like this app since I can write from my phone or from my computer. I just wish the computer version also had a dark theme."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that even though it's a free version, the app syncs effortlessly with all of my devices. I don't mind the ads at the bottom since they're in a small box, but I don't like it when the ad to purchase an upgrade of the app pops up randomly in full screen after a certain time while I'm in the middle of writing. Overall, I would still recommend this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Crying emoji needed, and a sadder sad face beside the sad face before the angry face. Also, dark theme for those who can't afford to upgrade."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to take small notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it just fine. It's easy to use and gets the job done."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for tracking my work day performance and the rest of the day's thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good little journal app, simple and quick to use, really like the flash back function. It's got lots of functions I could utilise but it's worth paying for the premium to get the most out of it. Like you can save photos and other neat functions"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Cloud sync is great. The app just works good. I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use, convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"3 yıldır düzenli olarak kağıt üzerine günlük tutuyorum. Ancak Play Store da böyle bir uygulama ile karşılaşınca denemek istedim ve şu kadarını söylüyüm bir daha bırakamadım. En yakın zamanda premium sürümü satın alacağım nasipse. Geleceğe iz bırakın..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Perfect for keeping track of all my thoughts across multiple devices."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is really useful and it's good that I can get back my entries from my broken tablet to my new phone since it synced. That's the most I love bout thisapp. But I do hope that NIGHT MODE IS AVAILABLE FOR EVERY USER IN THE NEAR FUTURE, not just Premium users u know. Thanks in advance"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is perfect for me. I don't have much time to sit and write my journal at the end of the day. This apps let's me write it on the way to work or back.

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app in every way. Easy to use with many useful functions. Great way to log your daily life and flashbacks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like this app alot, I think it could be more colorful and have more stuff to do but I love it!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great for me and what I need. I like the tags for keeping track of separate events"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Must have app. very good ui."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"BE WARNED: The business model for the developer is crystal clear and end users should know what to expect. 1) if you don't immediately sign up for the pro version you WILL have to repeatedly dismiss prompts to upgrade. For example, yesterday I opened up the app and instantly a pop-up, then I write a 15 second note to myself, save the entry and another prompt to upgrade occurred and when I tried to exit, another pop-up. If I wasn't clear 3 x pop-ups in less than a minute. If a shop keeper tried to do this in person, I'd tell them to f off but I've never experienced that even once in real life so, to the dev team, why do ya's think you can do this digitally? There is a reported on tactic in tech news articles, the most prominent is YouTube and the constant mid roll ads etc which is relatively knew, anyway the tech articles describe how tech company's employing purposeful frustrating user experiences to either get users to pay or stop using their service. I knew this in advance of contacting support and they defended the prompts, told me they provide a free service but at the end of the email the CSR said unless you pay you not one of our customers. This to me means, don't use their free app and if you do, pay for it and if you don't pay for it they'll purposely frustrate you with constant full screen pop-ups to purchase the pro version or uninstall. This company will treat you as a $ and nothing else until you give them your money and if you don't give money, and I'll say it again, they will deliberately frustrate you with an undesirable user experience. ◼️◼️EDIT 1◼️◼️ This is reply to developers reply. As I stated, if you guys think it's OK to frustrate people in to purchasing your app despite it being a nuisance, then I will decide to treat you poorly in my own way. Your consent was never needed for that, cry all you want but you get what you give. ◼️◼️Edit 2◼️◼️ Developers are very unhappy with me via email, here are some direct quotes from the CSR 🔷🔷""Don't worry about us, we have gained positive reviews as well. Our current priority is put all our effort and attention on paid customers for what they deserve, and less on free-riders."" 🔷🔷 🔶🔶""Do these screenshots look good on reddit as well?"" 🔸 this reply I took to mean that they are literally going to try engage in a media war with me/try to shame me because I have clearly stated to them I'll be sharing negative reviews online 🔶🔶"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes keeping a diary easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good application, but when I type my password, the premium sale ads pop-up and, when I close, I need to type the password again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simply a fantastic app. Does exactly what it is expected to and much more, without being at all cluttered or complicated. Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, clean and smart appearance."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journaling app. I seldom write reviews, but I do recommend this product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like how easy it is to use this app, and the availability across devices. I don't necessarily like how it sends push notifications just because I haven't used the app to journal when I've been using the chrome book app, but I suppose it gets people to use it more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app about for a week but I'm wondering if you can log in and still have your data in a different app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Handy app for quick journaling pn the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Enjoyed the app in the beginning. Haven't used it for some time so updated it and am now bombarded with pop-ups trying to annoy me into upgrading. I understand that I use the free version. It contains enough features not to have to upgrade. With this new strategy they can forget that I ever will. Google docs and Evernote will do just fine for basic journaling. I see no need to be so disrupted while trying to get some thinking done, it seems to completely defeat the purpose of wanting to use a journaling app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice journaling app. I've been using it for 4 years now. It does take a long time to synch several years of entries when you're setting the app up on a new device (or after doing a factory reset), and this last time I had to keep restarting the process, because I kept getting an error code. Overall I really enjoy the app and use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journaling app. It is just what I was looking for.  I have purchase the premium version.  I want the pc version is there a discount if you already have the android premium?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its an awesome app This app is everything you would look for in a Journal app I am using this app to save all the moments in my life for my son. When he's old enough he will see the ups and downs and how we all came to be where we are at that moment in time.  Just wish this app could be family Library enabled. Paying R365 a year for each member in a family is quite steep"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Developers need to get their act together. I paid for the full version earlier this year. After app upgrade my purchase is no longer reflected. I followed all the directions mentioned in a previous reply by the dev - uninstall, then install from web play store. Nothing. Even tried purchase option again. Google Play says ""you already own this item"". So, like I said, get your act together and fix this problem. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yeah writing review because your are asking me to. It's a good diary app too. At least for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great App. A++"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good. Only downer with the free version is that it pesters you heaps to upgrade to the paid version. Which is fair enough I suppose."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. It does everything I've been looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It makes journaling convenient and I love to add pics, location and weather to my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Using it for long. Wonderful app. But the fingerprint doesn't work most of the times. Why? Please fix it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice and useful application"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, great memory aid"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best part is that there are no disruptive ads. Interface is neat and clean. No messiness around. No complications."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good journaling app. I love the interface and the ease of access!! 10 out of 10 would recommend"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, meets expectations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"For more than two years I had given it a 5 star rating, will do again when the developer stops trying to shove a premium membership down my throat. Please stop. The app is the best out there(considering I've been using it for the past couple years), but I don't feel the need to upgrade to a premium membership just yet. I'd love to support the developer, but I am a student and hardly have the means to do so right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app to capture bitter sweet moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great Journal I have had a really hard time keeping a journal but having it on my phone has made it so easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, but my daily inspirations are not there anymore. I purchased the membership and could and nothing. Please add them back .."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for those looking for a solution to have their thoughts documented at any place or time of the day. A good alternative for diary. Thanks a lot for this useful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used several journaling apps but have always been sceptical of ones that lock up the text in proprietary formats. This one doesn't and it allows the addition of photos for each entry. It is easy, very attractive, and has a cloud version for when I am not writing on an Play store enabled device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Me encanta escribir con Journey es muy fácil y puedes subir cualquier cosa muy rápido"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Its great except there are too many popup ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this update👍👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to journal. Including photos, attachments, weather and locations makes memorable entries. Also the security features is much needed. Although the screen and keyboard don't rotate when typing, which is something that should be intuitive. Overall, this app is much appreciated."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Only problem is it doesn't have Google drive support. So no backup. Almost all other dairy apps in playstore have that option. Dear developers, it's not a big task to add cloud backup. Please consider it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the idea that I can pull this up without wifi can add pictures to them and look back at posts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice application"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sucks that the inspiration was taken away."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the format, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hi kindly help me purchase premium app. As In app adds suggesting purchase does not go beyond click."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Won't give me access to google fit even after buying premium app seems ok but definitely not worth the money."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been going through a separation with children and this app has been such a great aid in keeping vital records with photo's, video's, date, time and location stamps with the ability to print it all easily when needed.

Nothing wrong with that at all. Use it. 1 high bit of Praise I do want to mention, the voice to text on this app is phenomenal, I have never experienced better. It's very easy to hit the microphone and just chat away and the accuracy is so so much better then like my text apps or anything else. I just said this entire compliment without pausing and without looking because the stupid up covers up what I'm typing so I can't see it anyway. However if I get to the end and hit a. I won't change it and you'll know that I did all this Justin morning long paragraph speaking it. Thanks have a great day God bless (Lol, well, it almost made it) (I really am speaking quietly and not clearly and if I had it would have said that I did all this just in one long paragraph, and up = app. There is your proof. LOL. So whatever they use please please sell it to Google for a bazillion dollars and have them use it from now on because if this was my text app or a word doc thete would have been at least seven things to correct up above instead of one"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update: so with the new update it seems that the ads only show on the bottom and they don't freaking keep popping up into your face every second, making you forget things you wanted to write or what not. Also it looks more clean the UI, with all this things combined I am ready to happy pay for the pro version. Specially when you guys are not being annoying with the ads. This app does provide a lot of value. *(original review)* If you hate the intrusive ads just delete the app and download the apk from Google. Look for version 2.4.1"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I forgot to upgrade to 5 stars, this app is very good and useful. A must have for your daily journal. So far I'm liking this app. Have not used it long, that's why the 4 stars. But I feel I'm going to give it 5 after I use it for awhile. So easy to keep up with things I do. It's awesome to me. Thanks. I'm changing it to 5 stars because it does work and I see you respond to just about every one. Thanks again."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love the app. However it could do with some added functionality. A way to give access to another email account would be nice other than just your gmail account for emailing entries. Also have trouble saving the time to receive my emails. Integration with google keep would also be nice, but doesn't affect the app itself which is fantastic for basic journaling. Since we are in a digital age app integration would just be nice for apps like this."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy for recording your thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Downloaded 2 or 3 years ago and deleted in favour of a physical journal.

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love keeping track of our travels and good places to return."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful UI on mobile and desktop and backs up to Drive automatically for peace of mind..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would give it five stars but good god every time I open the app, open a new entry, save an entry theres an ad for the eternally ""on sale"" premium version. I will buy it... SOME DAY. Not now, and reminding me 5 times a day is helping me consider moving everywhere (but I won't, I've been using this app for just over 3 years now.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple easy journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app I came across till now. Free features covers almost everything that's essential. Love that I can sync all the data on cloud and can access it anywhere, can upload photos and locations. UI can be improved a bit though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm not able to say if it has adverts as I use the premium. My problem is that the app is way too bland. Some colours/paint bucket to highlight or differentiate between postings will be great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have premium, it's worth it. Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Constant barrage of requests to go premium and to leave a five star review can make it annoying to use this app. Still using for now, though."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I Cant directly to location tag without klik option, not availlable directly share the picture to social media such as whatsapp, etc, Can not draw the pictures,"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly fluid diary for instant memory storage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Just what I need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've always loved the idea of keeping a journal but setting aside the time to actually do so was challenging. With Journey, I can upload pictures the day they're taken with ease & the app itself will record the time and date it occured. I also use the tags for ease of navigation between the different ways I utilize this app: creative writing, reflections of my days, photos, downloaded snapchat mystories, and even emails with loved ones that I've copy and paste over. I LOVE using on both my phone AND laptop♡"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using since 2 years No worries"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My digital spine of all schedules and plans."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A daily reminder to leave a story for future me. I hate it when I instinctively dismiss the daily notifications and miss a few entries. Overall, I love this app. This is what Day One should've been, and I do not regret spending for the premium for this. If you value writing down memories on a regular basis, you won't regret paying for this either."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Using this app for a personal travel blog. It's amazing the thoughts that come to your head when they're being recorded somewhere. Highly recommended for everyone. The app is simple to use, lockable with a password and automatically backs up to Google so is accessible across multiple devices. Protip: start with a small basic daily entries and you will soon find that the time spend journaling is sometimes the best part of your day!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Why some features are paid and expensive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love being able to write down my thoughts add they come to me. I love the privacy setting. I love that one can add pictures."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice app to keep my memories and thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a beautiful app and I love it !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I believe it's the best Android journaling app. I am using it for quite a few years now and definitely recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why the hell do I need to PAY to export MY data?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Loved it once upon a time till I had to pay twice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best to let out my inner self..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good one"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm so thankful for this app. At the time I bought it I was so frustrated that I couldn't seem to talk peacefully with someone very close to me. I felt there was no one in the world I could speak peacefully with, or at least open up to whenever I needed to... So... I searched for an electronic listener and I found Journey. I can't thank the developers and the Play Store enough for making it available to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app is very easy to use. I record how my health progress daily. Love this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is very simple and convenient to use. Really like the Premium option and being able to journal on my phone and then it ca sync to my Laptop... I'm not able to access all.of the features in Premium. I'm still trying to figure out if it's my settings or the app? Okay up date on trying to figure out this app and the issues that I'm having. So I paid for premium less then 30 days ago for 5.99 then I just got done being prompted to pay 8.99 for premium again today? I also want to create or label different entries and make a almost folder of entries. For example... a folder labeled GOALS etc? How do you do this? I was looking in my settings of the journal app and I was trying to simply access some entries to add more and update them with pictures and then I was prompted to pay 8.99 for premium? What's going on? Do I uninstall this app? I have emailed the help desk that is listed for this app hopefully I will have an update soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love journey so far it's working well love all the features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Always enjoy journaling my life with the product. I usually remember to make notes. I am upset with myself when I forget to make notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Small, one off fee to use premium features, but easy to use and does everything I want it to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It works for me. I like the fact that it's not all prissy and girly, just strait forward journal to organise my thoughts and keep my past in order."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Nice little app but not a fan of the extensive permissions. There's no reason a journal app should have ability to force your phone on or monitor all the network connections."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been searching for a simple journal/diary to house my thoughts. Finding one that isn't intrusive or overly complex is a bit of a pain. Then I found Journal:Diary, Journal. It really is exactly what I need. And, even better, for a few £'s you can unlock some great functions within the app. ""Throwback"" entry's, a chart showing you your mood through a specific time etc. All great stuff. I also love the little piece of ""Inspiration"" you get every day...some of them have even helped me by encouraging me to write about thoughts I wasn't confident enough to put down in words. 12/10 would write again..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app, using to log journal entries for the start of our new business."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hope minimum photos that could be uploaded is raised to 10! 😁 Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Hope can change to night mode without need to go premium (paid)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal does exactly what I want. It's simple and doesn't require paying for the basic functions. It's perfect for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like the simple elegant interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping up with your daily life also love that it allows pics"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its a good app, and am use for a while, its useful and helpful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Kool beans"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"No categories we can create."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I like the concept.. however, i wish it was more customizable in terms of theme & colors & editing etc.. to me.. it will feel personal which is important for an app like this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Every time I've opened the app I receive multiple pop up requests to purchase premium. If I can't have time to enjoy the free version, why would I ever pay for premium? 0/5"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. Just what I need :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Somehow I forgot passcode but this app doesn't give any option to recover passcode. Now I can't open it."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really love the smooth interface and how you can connect across devices. Will be using this for a long time for sure!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish I found this app sooner. Wasting so much time and energy on trying other apps. This is the easiest app for write your journal, your thought or notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Need sync with google calendar option ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's overall a great app and does exactly what I need it to, but minus 2 stars for the constant bombardment of pop ups asking me to upgrade. To be honest, I would pay just to get rid of that and not be asked every time I navigate the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"was looking for a good journal app for my pixel book .. this app fits the bill 100%"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps u relief stress and everything ! I feel much better , I recommend this app 5 🌟 !!! Download it it's a MIRACLE !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It is so easy to use. I can jot down what's happening in my day super quickly. Great for a busy mom who wants to document her kids' lives."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Easy to use. I wanted somewhere to right down contemporarious descriptions - and it's working without fuss."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So I got a response to my last review. Their response was to upgrade the app which cost money. I'm not going to upgrade it. It was perfect before the upgrade. Now I'm looking for a new app. How discouraging this is. All about money. And Everytime I go into the app, I'm continually backing out of every upgrade ad, after upgrade ad to complete my entries or review them. It's irritating as hell. I have journaled in this app daily, 2-5 times a day. And I'm going to hate like hell to loose my data. But I cannot accept these terms. You lost me. Going to uninstall app when I find another one that suites me, or I'll start handwriting my entries. I can make my own graph. Shame on you, for destroying what was a wonderful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like everything about it. Easy to navigate, and syncs beautifully. I can't think of a thing I would change."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Gets the job done for free, awesome"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for everyday diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good journalling app! I don't even have premium and I still have a really good experience. It does everything it claims to, and really helped me reflect on my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great application. Finally can keep my thoughts up to date and tidy. Great idea to attached photos as well! Highly recommended!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It was just what I needed to keep some of my notes handy. Grateful for it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the only Apps that I have felt is deserving of a purchase. Been a user for over 2 years. It has only improved with time. Great UI. Easy to use and feature rich."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"a book that I can learn and grow from the past"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well I have not explored many of the features of the app, I've enjoyed using it on a semi-regular basis."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sleek and clean interface, easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Journey for scrapbooking. One day I will catch up and I'll need to recall every detail of everyday. Its easy to use. I can speak to text if I have a lot to say. Phone and tablet sync effortlessly. Love the date, time and location tags."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful design and so easy to use. I've tried many journaling apps in the past, this one is definitely my favorite!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"If the membership could stop being so disruptive it be perfect"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really convenient and not annoying with the sub stuff."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great. Easy to make entries. Makes journaling easy."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to organize your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, use it to capture moments that I don't want to forget and to remind for later."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wonderful developer. I think there's enough room for improvement. I like it and I wish anyone reading this will get it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm a senior and not a tech wise one. I like this because for my use I like simplicity. The Bells and whistles are available if I want them but for me me keeping it simple is keeping me happy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ts like a personal twitter"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Ive been using journey for quite few months since last year. I've encountered the same problem - the missing for premium and successfully restored it.But this time, When I tried to follow the instructions of restoring premium by uninstalled the app - Ive lost my data for half of this year - Ive already contacted cust service and checked the journey.cloud as told - but no data there. I thought it was sync automatically and really really disappointed. i wish there is a way to help me get back my lost data..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I liked this and paid for the upgrade. Criticisms are: it's not very obvious what all the functions are or how to use them - a manual would be handy. Secondly, the timeout before having to re-enter the passcode doesn't work like it should. It should only start timing after you close the window. It got so irritating having to re-enter the passcode as soon as you'd made an entry that I disabled it. I would like to use a passcode so I hope this will get fixed."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is easy to use. I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its easy to use. Pretty simple yet effective."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the idea of saving photos and notes to remind me of the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is good. No real complaints. Had some issues with the Chrome app recognizing my subscription, but now that they have a Linux app, I don't have any issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good for what it's intended to do. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app for my first foray in Journaling since I was a child"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've always loved to journal recently decided to make the learning curve to digital. This journal is great. Wish there could be something like an indexing for each entry and tags with searchability."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really helped me to process my day and be honest with myself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the ability to take notes. Daily journal. I keep my auto mileage on it and where I go each day. But I would also like to write entries by category or combine them not so much by the date but by theme or application which i have not been able to figure just yet, where the date is there but secondary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"IThe premium version has only lesser tricks than the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Spell check stinks. Editing tools non existent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful for keeping diary of days out and pubs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use every day helps my anxiety"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Lovely application to record lifestyle but it really irritated me how the advert for the upgrade made my screen space smaller and you can't change the theme unless you upgrade and even then it's only for a night theme. I liked how the font could be made smaller as well as bigger allowing you to see more on a page. The fingerprint scanner to enter into the app was also a nice touch. I've remained with another app however as it offers more for free. The £6+ to upgrade was not worthwhile and the free app alone wasn't enough for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am really loving this app! I love that it tracks my daily moods and the people Im with. Love the tags and daily inspiration. I am strongly considering purchasing the full premium version. Update 10/13/2018: Since my review, I have purchased the premium version. I really like the additional features. Including the ability to export backup copies of the journal. Wish I could add my stars to my rating!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Exported all journal entries then tried to recover them/import them back in and it lost about half my entries. Very unhappy with it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it so much! It keeps my life organized and easy to reflect and look back on things I'm tracking."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and helpful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Terrific journal app. The cloud based feature to use the app between devices works perfectly. I love how you can add photos. I enjoy writing, encoding my memories & thoughts, & have continued to use this journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to navigate, advertises upgrades... But if you're just simply looking for a place to jot down thoughts this is it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a decent app that's lets me write what's on my mind without a lot of nonsense"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Bought the premium subscription but now the app has even more ads about buying premium..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a simple easy to use journal. Wich is great. I love this journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, a place to pen my thoughts any time, anywhere."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and excellent features. It's got even better with the updates. I can dictate my diary, so it's quick and easy to complete every day. The mood box is a great addition. This is the only diary app I'd ever use now, because it's perfect for what I want. It even saves to a word document and I can back up all my entries. I'm entering all my old paper diary entries retrospectively and that's easy too. Brilliant! Can't recommend this app enough."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best apps I've tried. It is very user friendly!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is the best app I have used, it has not let me down"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am very happy with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It's ok and proving useful as a diary for my dogs poorly leg treatment.. The predictive text function is pants. STOP ASKING ME TO UPGRADE"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and secure! Xoxoxo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is useful for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journaling app. My favorite so far. Beautiful interface and so easy to use. If it offered multiple journals, it would be absolutely perfect for me. I'm an android user so I prefer it over One Day, as it syncs to all of my devices. But admittedly I am drawn to One Day's ability to create different journals. For instance, I have various projects going on and like to keep separate logs. One day allows for this. And if I were a Mac user, I would probably switch. However, because I love the look and feel of Journey so much, I'm sticking with it in hopes it will offer multiple journals soon."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wish the pc version was a one off fee intstead of being an ongoing payment system."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Pretty dam lame if ya ask me, the concept is appealing, but the layout is boring and uninspiring"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app, just what I was looking for! Only wish is for night mode to be on the free version, but I guess they succeeded in that one since it's the only reason I pay for premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thank you it's practical and convieniently syncs to my email."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like how this will allow me to record my journal entries with voice recorder and it tells me the date and place that I recorded it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best one to handle memories :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice to use as a journal or diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app is good. I have used it everyday for the past week. It is easy to add thoughts and keep track of what I did. I recommend this app. The only con is it is a little pushy on the notifications and upgrade recommendations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The constant reminder to upgrade is the most annoying. While using the app, I find myself automatically aiming for the upper right hand corner to clear the reminder. It's become habit now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Ignore what I wrote below. The idiots who updated this app (10/11) killed full screen mode in Chromebooks. What kind of boneheads do this? Very handy, very useful journalling program. My go to journal is MacJournal but I do not always carry my MacBook. This program is on my phone or Chromebook and what I type is easily exported. I could wish one could have more than one basic journal, but this will do. Free is good, Premium is inexpensive and the features are worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Cool app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I need"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use and convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Building up my own journey, and I'm loving it ..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I want, very good journaling app! I like the feature of seeing pictures and entries on a world map. I'd like it if I could permanently disable the option for showing the weather or my current state when writing an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for casual journalling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like this app because I don't have to worry about wasting paper. I've tried journaling before but I would always stop in a few days and not start again, then I would feel bad about wasting paper. The knowledge that I can quit any time actually makes it easier to keep writing. Being able to spell check and have it safely protected by the lock on my phone makes it feel like I can be more expressive of myself. A very good app, better than a regular notebook any day. PS. There are a few adds and they can be quite annoying but other than that it is a perfect app for journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just does want I need it to do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Like the app just wondering is there a way to connect to Google photos?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my husband and I to keep track of where we went and saw on vacations."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far I love it..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a easy way to journal your thoughts. It has some noce features like downloading pictures and videos to your day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really help me to make my daily life journal with ease, anywhere and anytime."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been my journal for several years. I love it. Reminds me to document important moments or times in my life that I know I will want to remember. Easy to use and pleasant interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"chose this out of all the ones i saw in the app store its been a month and I'm happy with it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Can't print unless I buy premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Early day's but good so far. Maybe asking for a review when ive had a chance to use it properly and possibly upgraded would be better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great, i like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Pretty easy to use. I like the reminder you can set, and that it will auto capture location, weather. Simple smiley button for mood - convenient. I like the map generated with my entries, but I haven't figured out a use for the graphs yet. Meh. Sharing feature is neat, but I don't think I'll use it.Wish I could add a photo to a regular entry with the edit function, unless I'm missing something, you have to create a new entry beginning with the photo. All in all, I recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Started using this app 2 years ago. It changed my life. I recommend it to my clients. Truly a game changer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great ap. Easy to use. I like that it reminds me in a non-intrusive way to write an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very user friendly, very easy to make notes, I can attach photos to have the place connected to the text, very easy to update"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Simple feature like hiding it's content while multitasking was expected in such apps. Should include option to import from json file format ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to document and journal. Love the voice recordings. Helping me with my accountability in wright loss management"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use and pic options are very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like that the app is portable and I would like more ability to edit my text"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i use it to store choice photos of kids and write a bit about them for them to read when theyre older"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Favorite!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great way to keep track of my day. I just keep forgetting to do it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was looking for the perfect app to journal what I do at work everyday and after downloading 3-4 others I found that this app was the best one to fit my needs. Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Don't popup premium subscription page everytime. That's really annoying. If someone feels like purchasing the pro version he will do it anyhow. You forcing someone to buy the premium will only annoy more and sometimes even people will uninstall the app just because of that annoying popup. Keep it clean so that people are encouraged to buy the premium by themselves .learn from apple and Mi marketing strategies, they don't force customers to buy, neither they advertise. Its the products quality. Even google offers numerous paid services but it never asks its customers to buy something forcefully. I have rated 5 stars but the way that popup was coming up everytime I opened app it was really very annoying."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for writing journal, events of life and important topics of interest"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Keeps me on track."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I uninstalled this because it started sending me push notifications."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app, I use it every day . Very easy to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Very simple, yet so useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Needs themes. Have to buy windows app for yet more money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolute love its format. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use, helps me develop the habit of keeping a diary every day😆 but the upgrade ad is a little bit annoying😯"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"... .. ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Can add pictures and other things. Easy and quick way to journal and note the good memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"good app. way spammy about wanting you to rate/pay"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping documentation as well as just journaling!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I'm using it to keep a diary related to a biking accident. It's easy to enter notes using speech recognition and I'm adding photos as well.  I am having trouble locating where to find support, though. The app says it syncs content with Google Drive but I cannot find my entries anywhere in Google Drive.   Still, this is a great app for journaling. Highly recommended."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app that somehow feels good to type texts on your phone. Big fan of night mode (requires one time pay). Don't have a subscription and so far I don't see a reason. But I might to support the team soon"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like it. It's like a journal in your pocket that has double security. (Your phone lock, then the app lock)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I loved it. I paid for premium a few years back. I finally got a laptop to realize oh, premium is another 17 dollars for a desktop version. Otherwise you can't use it at all. Which makes it completely useless for me. Will not use anymore"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I really think you should have a one time price not a MONTHLY subscription. Too many reminders to Upgrade, remove the link or pop-up to upgrade that is constantly at the bottom of your entry... IT'S annoying to see it there. Takes away from me wanting to write anything anymore! Overall a great App. Thank you to the developers."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app so much that I bought the more permanent option."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"When I installed this app a few years ago, I'm a bit skeptic that a paid feature can easily import content to another phone. But oh wow, it turn out it's so hassle free you don't even need to import/export data to your new phone. It's just need your same account name and voila your years of content just synced directly to your new phone with all pict, location, basically everything you saved years before."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yayyy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has gotten me to reflect on my days and appreciate life a little more. The hashtags are very useful subtle organization method and the usage data keeps me going without being pushy. The app design is also intuitive and simple as a journal should be."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far, this is a great journaling app. just wish I could add a bit more photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it. The features in the app is sufficient to record journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use and great for ranting when you have no friends :')"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app almost everyday. Super clean UX, smooth graphics, and amazing auto-save. I loved it so much that I upgraded to have voice entries as well. Totally recommend for those who have tried journaling the traditional way but couldn't stick with it long term. I've been using this for almost 2 years! 👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best among all I have used. Simple interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app to have. Being able to jot things down that I don't want to forget."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app ever to record my travels with pictures alongside. Favourite app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a log love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish I had started using this app when I was six instead of 69. I highly recommend this to anyone and their children. ASAP.!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A really good app, I've been using it as a personal diary. I would give it 5, but there's a bug where the screen won't rotate anymore."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best diary ever, you should definetly get it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, i share my all memory..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great way to diary or journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using this app weekly for more than 1.5 years and it has never let me down!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works and syncs over multiple devices. Adding pics is easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for maintaining a personal journal. Great UI design and pretty straightforward"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been looking for a good journaling app for years. Paper journals are hard to go back through retrospectively. This app is convenient to use, allows multimedia, and saves in Markdown format to my Google account. It is in a standard, lightweight format and is protected on my Google drive separate from the app. Great product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It works well, easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great app for organizing all my thoughts. I love that you can add pictures, videos, audio and your location to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its really amazing to share my daily experience, my journey and it's fun to read the past experience . Just love the app😙😙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Hell of nagging screen to update to premium plan. I am going to uninstall this if I find a way to export my content. ☹️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best journal app ever for when you wanna get your feelings out at 3am."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Love it so much I paid for ""Premium""."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I'm using it to keep a journal of my baby's first year to share with her later. It's amazing to be able to append photos to the journal entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great for entering thoughts and entries right on your phone. I appreciate getting this valuable tool for free."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just please make it add free for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal keeping app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a digital journal that allows me to dictate entries, in the moment if I wish, attach photos, quotes, or anything that I wish, and although my husband and I have a ""open phone"" policy, this allows me to use my finger print as my lock. A true diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had been looking for a digital diary that was easy to use. This works perfectly for me right now."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great product. I've tried others but this is the one I like to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Out of all things this journal can do, why can we not draw or write notes?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app. The only thing I don't like is that I can't have the premium (that I paid for) on my other computer. I need to pay for the premium every time I get a new computer :("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"In general I like the app however it is so annoying and that it is asking you to upgrade repeatedly. I also wish the features on the website or a little more robust."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what you want from a cloud based journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is an awesome app, I just wish I didn't have to keep putting in my passcode all the time !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years now. It works great for taking notes or writing a journal entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good App.. Loved it.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I tried this app, and while I can see this being useful for some people, it's simply not for me. I realized after installing this app that I don't like the idea of having my private life story uploaded to something I don't have control over. I'd rather download something that, while less flashy, stores my data exclusively on my phone so I can do what I want with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this a while and still love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like that I can put my thoughts down"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This journal is great for my daily short entries. It's also a good place to put notes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app is becoming infuriating with constant reminders to pay for the full version, with pop-ups and ads everywhere!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works great to write and keep records of awesome things that happens in my world. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been looking for a journaling app for a while that can handle my attachments and hold metadata about the day and the entry I write. And if I am not able to take the time to write out my entry I just do a video and post it. It's great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App that caters to all journaling needs!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Some events would show up out of sequence at times."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've tried so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is really awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"You should be able to add photos from google photos to entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dies what I want. Easy to use hence 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"If you were able to categorise your journal it would have been good. Health/ work/ relationship etc"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"After every single action you can make in the app, you are given a full page interstitial upgrade ad. I do not mind the upgrade sell, but not after every single action. Some idiot on the dev team decided to tell me that this is removed by the upgrade. Of course it is, you moron! But the amount of times you have to see the upgrade notice during a normal use scenario is completely unreasonable. This app is trash and so is the developer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Already bought premium membership but always remove the premium membership after some day. Thereafter I have to uninstall & reinstall for getting back the membership facility. This is very poor service & wasting lot of time for syncing the database. Appreciate if someone look in to this. Thanks.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am bad, I don't write everyday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far liked it.. Tagging and search is very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super easy to use for all your basics. 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. But I wish that when you added pictures it didn't change the date of the entry. Sometimes I want to re cap a few days, but if I add a picture from yesterday it changes the date of the entry too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good and very useful app...My best friend..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the best journal app. I have used many apps before this. But this is the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, very plain and simple. Had to pay for premium to get some features. If you are looking for plain simple text version dusty then this is great. But USD you want something beautiful with lots of features and stickers then this might not be it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only thing that improve this app would be if we could lock our messages. Either individually or in a file."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"PLEASE REMOVE THE PREMIUM UPDGRADE OPTION ON THE HOME TAB, IT JUST FOLLOWS YOU ALL THROUGH THE APP, IT'S JUST AS BAD AS ADVERTISING, PLEASE REMOVE THIS UPGRADE FROM THIS OTHERWISE SPLENDID APP"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I just wrote my first entry and so far, I like it. I will probably pay for premium in the next couple of weeks. It's simple and enjoyable. Got the premium. It is worth it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to empty your thoughts into. I use this for all my writing.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful and easy to use as well !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and beautiful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I think this is the best journal app i have tried. I have used it for years now. However, i dislike how this app give the suggestion to upgrade the app. I didn't really realize it until recently that everytime i open this app, the suggestion pop up. I am grateful that this app is available for free without any ads but i just think the suggestion to upgrade is too excessive. I hope the developer can tune down the suggestion, like only when the user tries to use a premium feature or just the banner (which i find annoying at first but I'm used to it now). Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Too pricey! What is the difference between the ""pay once and keep forever"" and the $30.00/month one? (I rounded up.)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the journey app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Am able to track my travels with photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this is app is not only the most important but also extremely useful app for all ages. For me personally this is the most awaited app - diary for long after so many searches and after so much trial for various dairy app I found this perfect one I am so much satisfied and happy with it. Thanks a lot..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great journaling app. It is so easy to use! I have been using this app for quite a while now and it has helped me to build a habit of creating journal entries on a regular basis. I do have one suggestion, however. It would be nice if we could add captions to pictures that we add to journal entries. That would help to us to be more clear in the story we tell in our journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For my daily devotionals i love its simplicity but this app also has all the tools you need to capture your thoughts. There is a premium version if you want to capture your journey audibly but this version allows you to write, attach pictures, capture emotions etc. I am very happy with my new life tool!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would appreciate separate folders in addition to the ability to add tags. I also want to keep a gratitude journal, but I want it separate from the daily record. But I do like how easy the app makes it to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I wanted it to do. Nothing... Just record my daily meditation notes. Simple!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to look back at your previous day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very very useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far it looks good to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Such a great app, it makes keeping a journal an absolute breeze! I used to struggle to keep up with entries, however the notifications mean I rarely miss a single one. 5 stars from me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"wonderful Journaling app, highly recommended"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very convenient way to record thoughts when it's convenient and I have a couple minutes. Cross-platform capability is very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been a godsend. Whether it's one sentence or five paragraph it makes writing down my feelings a lot easier. It encourages me to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great. Easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app allows me to record all the fun things I've done, AND the neat photos I've taken in each place, on each day of my trip there. I ABSOLUTELY, 100% LOVE IT!!!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy tool. Great way for me to get my thoughts down. All english, no adds except for suggestions upgrades you can buy for the app, but even without them it's great! And it's free!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app has best features when compared to other diary apps but they increased the premium price suddenly which is a bad gesture. So, I'm rating it to 2."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that it has a very user friendly interface!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"You know what grinds my gears, the constant advertisement for premium but I mean, that's what we get for living off free journey right"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"And generally gives you what you give. If you use it I can do everything for you if you don't... Gives you nothing. It's very Zen ... I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app best there for Android"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this as my Jiu-Jitsu journal and it works great!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and powerful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app so much. I think I paid for the lifetime subscription, and it's so worth it. I do worry, sometimes, that I might lose everything if it's electronic, but I just need to go print pages from online and I'm good to go! So many nice features, including the always essential password for prying eyes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really great way to keep take of your memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app! So very worth it to go premium!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love that I can input for past days, and that I can add pictures, as well as see my entries in a list. It was a choice between this one and one that had much prettier backgrounds, but seeing my entries in a list won. Thank you for a great, easy to use app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for keeping a daily journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is great for me to use as a pain diary. I like the set up and no ads"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice tracker of your daily activities. We used it during our vacation in western Australia and Thailand. It's good to see where you were when you can't remember. It has a few bugs but in general it's doing what you want it to do. Passcode feature works as well although a bit too tight (when saving an article it asks you again for your passcode to let you see your overview)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, useful and easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I can't use frontal camera when recording videos. Please fix asap. I'm planning to buy the full package but not with this bug"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great apps, would give 5 star if it use 1 time payment instead of monthly payment for pc platform."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm glad that I can use this application to keep a record of my life and that I can also back it up to Google Drive and even save it as a ZIP file. I've always tried to be organized and this journal application has been a great help to me. I've been able to go back through my paper journals and actually type in those entries into the application so I have them backed up (I use a wireless keyboard when I use this application). Being able to upload to WordPress is nice, but being able to do it with other applications or websites would be a nice touch as well. Overall, I fully enjoy this application and have recommended it to others."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Annoying popping ads everytime when I need to make a post or check past entries. Otherwise, it is quite handy for daily records."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've never been this consistent at journaling, before this app came along. Now I can jot down a quick idea on my phone before I forget it, and I can also write the longer entries from my keyboard."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I downrated because now the developers are trying too hard to get people to upgrade with all the new annoying popups! This tactic only pisses people off!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Live the app. Easy to use and available on multiple formats."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, I like adding photos to entries. Nice being able to journal on the go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sync thru Drive to all devices is what made me test try the free version of this app. If it performs well during the next month I'll buy the premium package."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First time used, and as far as best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"easy to use, intuitive"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"If only the font was a little larger that would be perfect."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Could be a decent app if it didn't ask you for a paid subscription EVERYTIME you open it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent diary app. I use it mainly to documenting holidays and mini-breaks and the like, but works well as a tool to journal one's life. Recommended."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Perfect for what I need"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple, to the point and no faff ☺️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the better journal apps. My favorite, as it syncs to my Gmail acct."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Only install this app if you want to be constantly harassed with notifications to upgrade the app. It indicates very little respect to the consumer. Because of how far these ads go, I have committed to never giving this company a single cent. And I urge everybody else to do the same."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good for writers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app for journal entry. One has to pay separately for each platform. Please consider giving discount to those who have already purchased app for one platform."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a real time killer"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far easy to use and fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A perfect virtual diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app! Love that I can add diary entries to dates and include pics so I can refer back to when and what happened at certain times, but I can also use it as a real journal for myself. It was well worth purchasing the full app. I am sure there are several other uses, as the app is pretty flexible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love how the diary display. The app also easy to use. Just perchance the upgrade version, really enjoy the night mode and more photo"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to track dates and times"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Practical Quick & ez to use for those who 'd like start routine journalling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Text cannot be formatted. Sometimes the web version hangs and crashes."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Nag. Nag nag nag nag. These are fine, should start in a week or few days of use, not instantly. This is 10 or twenty lines of code. Why? May revisit unless I delete."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for a diary keeper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ot is intuitive does it in elegant simple efficient way ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm using this app to document my two young children's lives as I find it hard to find the time to physically write in a journal at the moment. It's great to attach media to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app with awesome UI but you will always regret not having a premium account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect diary app. It's the only app I've paid for and I feel it was a great buy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to reflect on your actions for the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A very convenient way to log and remember your thoughts and ideas."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love this app, I recommend to the men I lead and disciples, but I would have given it 5 stars if it allowed you to record your journal entries. Then it would be perfect. Even the lesser apps have that feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Just trying to nurture self awareness. Better add an option to unlock with fingerprint for faster unlock"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good daily journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly ..can add photos and videos. Can tag events. No ads. Auto sync to google drive. A must for those who want to keep their memories for life..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Can dictate into app, very convenient and accurate (HTC One M8), which saves a lot of time. Can add photos, etc, but not wholly intuitive. Tried to purchase Premium but said I already had this. Not the case, so I'd appreciate some help or clarity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Option to add older images for older entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"❤️"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly and efficient. Great experience using this app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"excellent app!!! Thank you!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find myself motivated to do things so i can record them in this app. I find it satisfying. Straightforward and stylish interface, and a business model I trust not to sell all my private data. Premium is well worth it, for the features and to support the developers. I'm glad i tried this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Phone app is mature. Expected functionality is available. But web client is immature. For example it is easy to lose one's typing! Manually saving every 50 words seems appropriate. I expect more functionality (foolproof and convenient) so that web client supports the way I think, the way I journalize."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journal helps me stay on top of my Journaling with beautiful pictures to add depth and color"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this. Easy to use."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great works as expected"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"very good app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"DON'T BUY!!! I paid $7 for this app in a fit of rage against my spouse and now I don't see any difference between what it was before I bought it and what it is now that I paid for it. I wish there were some way to add text formatting so I can change font or font size. I can't even add italics or bold print to my entry. This is a great app, I just wish I hadn't paid for it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"UI is not good. Improve front ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfectly created just what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A really good way to build a visual diary for the year."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Good functionality but reminders to upgrade to Premium get far more frequent the longer you use it & become a real nuisance!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Have been using it for three years now, and it's the best journal app among all those I've tried!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is one of my key apps! It's a great way to keep memories close but also helped me through some dark moments where I needed to unload and getting things out that would otherwise have stayed in my mind to fester. So thank you keeping me mentally healthy as well :)"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just awesome app for recording day to day privately. A nice journal with photos."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best $5 I ever spent for my own sanity."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoy the app 100%"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been trying to find a good jurnal to keep tabs on what I have done. I am crazy about this app. It is by far the best free/and paid for jurnal app that I have ever used, very simple to use also. I can pull it up on my phone or my tablet also set a reminder so that I don't forget to wright that days events in. I have now had this for at least three years now and I absolutely love how I can go back in my journal and see what all I have done in my life so far. I particularly like that it actually helps me keep my life events in order. I do like how it will give you throwback days and show you an entry that you wrote a year (or two) ago."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Never kept records before very easy to use app 5 stars"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This has been a great app for tracking my journey. It's pretty robust and flexible. No complaints."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"GREAT. I WOULD LOVE WRITING ALWAYS HERE!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app to note down all your thoughts of the day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app but now I am constantly bombarded with pop-up ads for premium. Before I post, after I post, when I first log in, every time I edit a post, after I put in my password, while I'm writing an entry... all the time. Unless you love being interrupted by pop-up ads do yourself a favour and get a different journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I used Journey almost every day because it fits my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good, easy to use and visually pleasing app. I use it for journaling and the beginnings of writing ideas and it's more than adequate for that."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great app to keep abreast with your activities..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's perfect for the job. Keeps track of all my feelings and emotions. It's like my priest at church. Tell them and do everything together lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice, easy & useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not sure I know all of what this app can do, but what I have figured out I am liking. What I dont like is that there was no tutorial and so it's taken time to figure out what should have been straight forward."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good, easy to use. Wish the extras didn't cost extra!!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just a great app for daily journaling..also for travel memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The free version nags you to upgrade incessantly. I only add one entry a week on average, and every time I open it to add an entry, it has at least one pop-up asking me to upgrade. It's fine if you intend on using the paid features, but the free version is irritating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love having this available when I have thoughts I need to get out. Tagging them is wonderful, as I can easily find anytime"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its best diary app what i perfectly wanted."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good aplication"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been writing a blog for three years without a good app to save my diary and this has been more than what I expected when I tried it. Excellent app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Able to take screen shot, which should be disabled."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great app but it's little costly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Free version has too much ads nowdays. A dark tagline of premium version is fixed to shown up. App ask to upgrade to premium version on every time when opened."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Great journaling app that I would give 5 stars but always advertises its paid for version. It gets annoying. I understand things can't be free but don't advertise constantly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Bermakna"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Handy and easy to collect memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!!!!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I've just started using Journey and am really impressed with it so far. I have only one gripe: I don't seem to be able to use it in landscape and this significantly slows my typing speed. Is there a way to get the app to rotate?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I started using this app about two years ago. Back in time this app was a FREEMIUM which basically means you had this option to use basic functions including PDF exporting. Also you could upgrade for more. But recently I figured that they don't let you export your data anymore unless you pay for a membership"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish it bring the microphone back but side that it's good love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant app. We'll worth the £2.79 or whatever it was for the full version...go on, spoil yourself!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has the ability to change your life. Writing journals is such a cathartic experience and it is so easy to use, you just need to motivate yourself to write something. I've stuck with it for over a year now and make sure I write something every week but ideally every couple of days . The best feature for me is that when I post a photo it back dates the entry so I can write about things that have happened and keep it in the right order and with the right date and time linked to it. It even keeps the weather information so it shows what the weather was when the post should have happened!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks for doing this."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a great way of jotting down your thoughts. I used to use DayOne on my Mac a lot, but thought I would try something different. Journey is well designed and offers a focussed experience for you to write your daily entries. I love the phone as a platform for journalling (as opposed to my laptop) since it's always on me and really convenient. I set a reminder at 9pm every day to make a quick entry. If I were to make any comments, I would like a bit more of an ability to customise the app with more fonts and colours, but that's a minor criticism to this already great app."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is one of the finest journal app I have encountered and it packs tons of cool features in it as well which is great. The only thing I feel they should add is trail for the premium version, because I want to see how the exported content should look like but I just can't do it because I export without the premium version.

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"DON'T USE!! I'd been using this app for YEARS, then when I tried to download all of my entries, I had issues with firewall settings preventing the desktop version from installing on my computer, and the instruction to disconnect Google Drive resulted in losing ALL of my entries. The app help desk has been of no help in restoring anything, so I've lost everything. UPDATE: I did not verbally abuse anyone. I wasn't getting a response and am understandably upset about losing all of my entries. The fact that your company sends the same response over and over again doesn't attempt to resolve the issue, nor did you acknowledge whether or not you keep any backups for when problems like this occur. Instead, you just ignore emails. And, I would never have disconnected Drive if I didn't read about doing so somewhere in your help section."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, pay separately for each OS, but still functions. This is my go-to application for taking notes, doing dictation for myself to type up later on my PC, and what journaling I do."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I haven't been so faithful about journaling in years. The reminders and ease of use are awesome. Premium is worth it, too! I love being able to print off multiple entries at once."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app that i have found. I love being able to include pictures!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Wonderful app... I purchased the premium version on my other phone and also installed it on this one, but it doesn't reflect that on this older phone. I'm a bit baffled, as I don't wish to purchase it yet again."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I very much enjoy this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app very useful and secure, Fingerprint lock and Cloud Backup makes it amazing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"hi! i need help. so ive been with journey since early 2017 but i can only find posts from early 2018? did it perhaps get deleted? how do you bring them back? help?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Mantap"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's easy to use. I'm thinking of buying the premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Turned my 5 stars to 4. Great app overall but they removed features like Throwback and Inspiration and are now pushing a monthly subscription. Don't take features away I paid for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really good app that is simply what it says it is. No fluff and I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the perfect way to keep a diary. I've been using it for quite a while & I love it's convenience and the features available to me. A nice set of emojis to express my emotions on that day would be a lovely improvement. Other than that, this is great for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a simple way to keep a lasting journal. Looking back over the years is wonderful. Thanks for this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I had Universum Universal Diary but switched phones and they do not have cloud. But this journal is amazing. I use it almost every day on my smartphone and tablet. And I love the tag feature that is built in. What a wonderful journal app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy way to keep up with writing. I love the inspiration section when looking for what to write. An easy to follow interface on your phone. Wish I had started using it sooner. The Atlas feature is great and allows you to easily document your travels and your reflections and have them all laid out on the world map. Nice how it takes away the leg work of setting up your own map. This app gives you a a tool for looking at your past journey and current journeys in different perspectives whether it be via a map, calendar or a photo record of the things you have done. I really love the different ways you can view all your past entries. It is a great way of getting into a habit of writing. I love how it backs up on your google drive as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping notes with your pictures, educates you to go for quality instead of quantity, or to at least have some ""signature"" shot for every entry. Pro version has nice and easy text formatting options as well  (""wiki style"" via mark down.) Maybe I just can not find it, but I am missing some sort of show mode where you can go through all of your photos instead of one entry at a time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better way to keep journal.. Of adventures, daily life and whatever you want to.. You can add location, time, weather, activity and pictures. I can even peint the journals. It's a good experience."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app...thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice integration with Chrome and Markdown syntax. I wish it had a non date organized notebook too. Still it has been a great purchase. Recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So I like the app but it won't let me use the weight on my computer Every time I go on the s8ght it freezes and won't load also it says I only have the basic one on the computer but I have a paid subscription on the phone"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does the job of a diary perfectly - very intuitive and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for Travel and daily Journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like it ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So Amazing this Journal is! I love it cause it is portable and if I break my phone I just download the app put in my password and email and there my journal is, all saved and I dont have to rewrite anything in its! You can also rate your moods and how you feel each Day and it charts it for you showing your good and bad days! Just everything about this app is great!!!!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for your life planning.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I use it to jot down my thoughts and my prayers. Give it a try, you will love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journaling has helped my mental health. This app makes it easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use it as a journal for my studies. It works perfectly. No complaints."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's awesome, just write whatever you feel and it'll make you feel better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Found it relatively easy to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My best and most used positive and productive app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app I've seen. I'd like it more if it were driven by Google Drive or Dropbox. I mean like in a Markdown file or plain text. Something that can outlive the app itself."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Super cool app, though would be cool if it could make atleast some text from handwritten journals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use this has become part of my daily ritual"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! I was looking for a food tracking app but none of them were quite what I was looking for. This is exactly what I wanted. I upgraded to premium so I could add in pictures and links of my recipes for later reference. Easy to use and I'm very happy with it so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. But now the devs have gotten really greedy. Every time you launch the app you get a full screen ad and also at the bottom there's so much space wasted to show a banner ad. The premium has no good features that would make you wanna buy it. Stop being so greedy. I'll buy premium if you add features worth the price tag and using 20% off as an excuse to show those ads is lame. A sale that lasts all year long is not a sale."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm happy with the app so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Voice recognition stinks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thnx a lot for such an amazing app. Keep it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is the best... Easy to use, simple to organise... Love it very much..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Been using for years and they have kept adding new and useful features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"the best application. Must download"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the use of markup language, but is not consistent across Win10 and Android in terms of formatting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good plan's helper 😁"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely a wonderful app that helps secured writing"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is a great app. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"As one that keeps journals I've been through a multitude of journal apps free and paid versions. This is by far the best of them all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think its a nice app But sometimes a little remembering goes a long way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I really liked Daylio and this is a better version of that app because it can be transferred across devices and exported/saved much more broadly and securely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick, easy and innovative"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite.. This app is so clean and smart.. Perfect match for me xoxo 🗣"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it works.. simple as that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is brilliant expect for one that is absence of voice recording... hope u will include it in future updation.. otherwise this app is so good. Thank you... 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Хорошее, приятное на вид приложение. Это очень немаловажно для моего внутреннего эстета"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I absolutely LOVE this app. However the constant push to upgrade (paid) is getting extremely annoying. I think I may start looking for a new app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Well, I paid 6 dollars for premium, which promises what it doesnt offer. There's no ""markdown syntax,"" so I cant style my texts like it says I can, but all I can do is hope for a refund or an update. I'm begging you all dont get premium, but it's a good app overall."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app with awesome support."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps. Excellent job team member."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"PERFECT for journaling, quick notes, tabs on day-to-day agendas, lists...whatever you need it to be; you can make it your own."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Useful and easy to used...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Elegant and simple 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Many great features. Does everything that I want it to."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful way to keep memories, and even organize my meeting notes for work. Love that entries are searchable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! It's the best one I can find to fit all my journaling needs. Adaptable, easy to use and aesthetically pleasing, I have simply stopped looking for something better... ❤💕💞"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to collect your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I tried many journals/diary apps and this one is the best for me overall. It's intuitive and simple to use. I can capture many thoughts and activities very quickly and at the same time attach pictures. I haven't tried the voice recording feature yet but I'm certain that would be handy for many users. Very happy with this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is my go to writing/journal/dairy app! Fixed on this after trying out a lot off different apps! My most favourite! I like the online cloud support feature so I will never lose all my writings."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awsome, one of the better journal apps out there"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it says. Minimal and functional"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it, so easy to use 💓"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple way to get things off my chest. It can be as short or as long as I need it to be so I can get my head clear."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it sets out to do. Could use any notepad but this is less fuss. Tabs would work better if horizontally displayed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Its ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's the perfect app for diary keepers. Am thrilled"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Expensive! Why is everything turning g itself into a subscription service. Whata waste of money! Plz change this!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic is all I can say!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing diary app... I write in this app every night."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really like the way of organising memories with #"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the beautiful minimalistic design and the practicality of this app. I'm using it mainly as a food journal at the moment so being able to add photos, time, mood and even the Google fit integration are great! I wish there's the functions of rearranging the order of the photos, and minimising the calendar view when scrolling up to look through multiple entries made on the same day. Having time stamps on the photos might be good too. This is a great app and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I was waiting for import from penzu option but i guess it will not be free either like most other services."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Bug free no glitches in it so far. Installed about 2 weeks ago. It's really encouraging me to write. I hope to use the publish feature eventually working on a project. Just thrilled I can save my hand and write as much as I want to. Love that I can turn on any android I own and resume typing . Very thrilled can type by voice. My new bff plus I love the security feature, mine is password protected. The sort of entries I put there it has to be protected. Very glad I discovered this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My go to app to track important event the tagging feature allows me to look at categories.like tracking weight over time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very private, for your private thoughts"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app and the user-friendly features in adding pictures, tags etc. Would be nice if we could add in a title for each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app because it isn't too fancy. It does exactly what I need it to do and I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great little app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I bought the premium version which is nice but I'd love to be able to add a photo and a voice note, not choose between the two. Typing takes too long for me to get out everything I want to say, so I like the voice note feature but then I can never add a photo."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Llevó casi un mes usando esta aplicación, se convirtió en parte de mi. Un pequeño amigo con el puedo platicar durante el día. Gracias ~~"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app. Very useful. It includes pdf conversion. Please include magazine creation option. Weekly/monthly/yearly magazine in pdf format and video format. App seems incomplete without this feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! Love the ease of journaling wherever I am, whenever I can. Not tied down by carrying around a physical journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. I love that it has a lock on it. I love that you can add pictures to it. Its so easy to use and navigate. Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use the app daily. It's perfect if you need to write down your thoughts quickly, before you forget everything you think, or keep some information. Works fast, interface is just good, easy to use. There is one thing that annoys me though. The app forces me to buy premium almost every time I click something.. I mean, that's too much. Every time I open the app, every time I start new entry/close it, this thing appears on full screen. That just triggers me. Make it appear not that often."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app worth purchasing the premum subscription"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"After a change of phone to Oneplus 6, it seem to work fine with two accounts after upgrades. Would still like Photos inline (in the text) and better export options (Markdown etc). And how about @mentions and #tags?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful to keep up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I luv this app..I actually enjoy writing in it cause I can attach pics etc to my daily journal..Which makes it more enjoyable and nice to be able to look back on..The best Journal I've had so far..😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this! It has really boosted my mood and helped me pay attention to the world around me, and how happy my life really is 😊❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was looking for something that I could write my thoughts and monitor my progression and this app is amazing. It shows how you've been feeling over 30 days or longer which pits things into perspective and helps to improve it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great product, so much so it's the first app I've purchased. Premium is there way to go !!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I originally got the app to document my children's progress, but I find myself using it on a daily basis to record ideas, thoughts, and dreams. I'm pleasantly surprised by the ease of use. The UX is super intuitive and the tags are invaluable. I'm seriously considering upgrading to the Premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app is very easy to use for the most part. I did make the mistake of putting too many pictures from different days on at the same time, and so they were all put on the same date. And I can't figure out a way to remove the pictures that are on the same date and I guess if there's no way, that's just a learning curve. So otherwise I think that it is a nice app. I've enjoyed using it for tracking my diet."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. I have purchased it and enjoying all the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"UI is very beautiful. Color is clean, everything crisp and easy. You can add different tags, weather is automatically set and other customizable options."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Please, add weekday"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app to write down out moments ... Can attach media as well...... It helps to backup also"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy. Type new entry. Post new entry. Has timestamp and date. Very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"pretty useful and the features are also neat. so far didn't face any problem."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, simple and beautifully designed. I love writing in it, and love how it puts in my location, weather, mood and what I'm doing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Brilliant app but it should be option available to make date, entry and everything else bold or resize as one wishes, please sort that out, I find the calendar writing small and there is no option for highlighting a date or or note"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The only feature I would love to had added was if we could use different font and sizes in the same note, for example large and different font for heading and normal for rest of the note.. also bolds and italics options should be available..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy way to keep a journal. I use tags and mood icon a lot and have the cloud subscription to use the desktop app as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Nice app But i think if you add a title field then it will become better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesomeness on a tablet...💙"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dear journal I love it and i hope to improve with regards on the addition of pic files etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Quick to write and edit."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and Good app. Easy replacement for your paper journal, year diary, etc. The fingerprint/pwd lock adds security and privacy. Also the daily reminder to write down your journal is an add on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've wanted something easy to use to help me journal more. This is so easy. I can use it on the computer or my phone. The only thing I don't love is having to pay for the app on the phone and then again on the computer. But the paid version is worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this app... After get this app ,my writing speed increased rapidly. Good app👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is helping me a lot keep track of thoughts, feelings and memories!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's really excellent. The voice recognition is remarkably accurate."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great, simple, all the features you need and shine data to track usage."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only just started but its good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does everything its says it wil. Would like more print options.. like wher the photos should be placed and wht size and all. Overall great work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Like the app. Great way to get my thoughts down and incorporate music and pics. Wish there would be more fonts to choose from and instead of changing ALL the journaling done would just change the immediate entry...sometimes a font can say almost as much as an emoji how a person is feeling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I love the app and I would have given five stars, but I found out that, although I've already paid for the app (I first found out about it on the phone), upon realising there is a desktop version and downloading it, I was unable to even use it without paying for it, too. Sleazy move. Most of the programs at least have some trial period and can be used, but this one not even that. Quite a big disappointment."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I always found journaling a hassle. I'd put it off until I found the perfect hardbound journal. This app makes it easy. I pick it up and go naturally into a space of writing. Perhaps it's because our phones are soi intimately attached to us now, this process feels private and natural. I ealso enjoy the ability to add a photo or video. It is le a placeholder for your mind."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I am a premium user. This app has been great. We have a our first baby, I wasn't keeping up on posts to facebook, labeling each photo so it makes sense in an album, responding to comments. I want to spend my time with my baby, not on social media. This app lets me quickly add my photos or videos, blurb a memory to go with it, tag; birthdays,family members or events to easily track then down to share. More time to do what I want and keep our memories. I will be adding the app to my partners phone so he can easily add a blurb as well. I would like to be able to: -Add video and photos in the same post. -Permanently rename locations such as ""home."" -Choose a feature image when uploading more then one. -More font formatting options would also be great, bold, italic, underline, two sizes. Thank you for the great app, and responding to everyone. :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"This app was good. I wasn't too become premium user. But the cloud add-on was costly i feel. Every month is not good idea to me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sync feature is awesome. Been using this for about an year. No downs still."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm glad I installed this great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, actually does what it says and works flawlessly. Finally making journaling a habit. Thanks!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been looking for this for a long time! Thanks for an excellent creation!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"I will change my rating and buy monthly subscription to all devices when: - person tagging in photos will be made available; - when I will be able to change the folder the photos and videos are saved in, as my internal storage memory gets frequently filled because of this app and I want to change to SD card; - I will be able to export my data to custom templates in .docx and .pdf instead of the plain template currently offered and even add my own templates; - it will take a shorter time to add photos to an event as it takes too many clicks and in my holiday I decided to use plain camera instead to shoot photos continuously; - when I will be able to mix photos with videos added to an event; I paid for the premium version. Why am I limited to 4 photos added to an event? It filled my internal memory as I couldn't change to save to SD card and consequently I deleted it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I used this for a journal and it works really well. I just wish you didn't need to pay $5 for certain things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app if you forgot about your activities of past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The most useful diary app as it allows you to sync notes with all your android devices & Chrome. Backup options are also good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Where's the 6th Star? The best!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A modern alternative to a personal diary. Very easy and intuitive to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Works well and like the flashback to the past."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice. Got premium today"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love this app alot. I hope the free version will allow more photos and videos to be attached to an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. No one but me can see my entries and it's so pirvate and no one even knows I have this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just love it !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for over 2 years now and I love it. I recently changed my password and now I forgot what it is & I don't see a password reset anywhere. Please help!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I own the paid version of this app and they're still regular instances of freezing. This app is clearly buggy unfortunately it seems that the technicians behind this app don't care to provide any updates or improvements."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for Journaling. I ended up buying Premium and have met my goal of Journaling more this year!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use. Let's you add 4 pictures to an entry in the free version. Should absolutely recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"For starters like me a app like this is worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the tagging and the star feature the most but the whole app is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good... Will use it often..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app indeed to save your memories as they happen. Loving it.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Damn useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app, and glad I came across it. I even purchased the  premium feature which is certainly worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really handy to have. It works well. If you could print a whole week's diary on one sheet of paper it would be perfect. Thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Started using the app on my last trip and after a few days found it did everything I hoped it would. Easy to use to jot down notes and includes automatic entries for weather, location, date and time. Take a photo and add it to the entry. Easy. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Keren"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Every thing is excellent. But cant export in in free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"With all the features (premium included) it is the best journal app I have ever had. But one thing, there is not so many things to do with the basic version. A basic version doesn't mean you put all the common features aside."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome... please make the purchase price with more discount..a bit expensive to purchase..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I upgraded from a paper Journal to this app and have found it to be a great replacement."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hi Thanks for this great app. I am premium user that really loves your app. I have been using this app frequently for the last few weeks and the one thing that is annoying me is the file attachment popup.. especially that of photos.. I don't know why I can't choose different folder which have my photos.. it has been set to recent folder I think by default... Basically, what I want is a explorer type popup in the photos attachment function.. because most of my photos are old and distributed in different folders.. I would give a 5 star if I could get to choose the folders in that function. Thanks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I love it. It could use a lot more features. But so love that it backs up and can use on my computer and laptop. You have to pay separate fees but worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm new to this app, but using it for the last month as been great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome journey app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simplicity makes it even better."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best personal journal I ever had"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm having a ball with this app. I love that I can add pictures to capture my mood or situation, that I can set headings, and that I can add tags to tie together related entries. Hey Devs, how about a cursive font?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to record photos and journal entries"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent daily diary, synched over both phone and PC where I do most of my updating."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It would be nice if the app didn't keep reminding me to try voice recording"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find it convenient to be able to pick up where you left off from another device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for Journaling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Brilliant and simple to use. Exactly what I wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very awesome. I think of a better way to capture all my little life memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Straightforward to use from the start. Can automatically record your location with each entry, as well as time and date. Easy to return to an entry later to extend or otherwise edit. Photos can be associated with entries, as we as hashtags. The best journal app for my taste so far."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The cost of installing on PC in Aust is $US 16. 00 This would be $20A. Far too expensive for what it does. App on tablet & phone work well, but having to pay $7 A for premium version on phone & tablet would be $A14 plus PC $20 = $34A. Unrealistic. Consequently I just use standard version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using this for two months now and I love, love, love this app!! Beats jotting down various thoughts or quotes throughout the day on post its. I am so grateful for it. It has all the journaling tools you need (tags, videos, pictures, etc.) right at your fingertips. It has a very simple interface that makes it so easy to use. And no annoying adds. Plus it lets you password protect your entries at no extra cost. That's awesome! A+ The only thing missing for me is a header or title line for entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome!!! It would be nice if adding an option to select an image as cover photo of an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Right i have just downloaded and i want to know the honest truth can you see what i put"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping track of my thoughts and feelings. Adding pictures and audio is a great feature too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app, simple and so good for ones mental health to write for your eyes only to read. Just wish I'd found it earlier in my life!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm a premium user and would say that this app is awesome. Simple yet effective. However, I would love to have an option to auto backup my entries to google drive periodically. What say?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use Journey to keep track of my calls. Works great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dear dev, I'm a premium user. Few days ago I update the application in playstore, and now my premium account is no longer available. Plz fix this, I've been using this for such a long time. Updated** Dev team did a great job in handling issues regarding my premium account. I can say I am a forever supporter for this application and I appreciate everything, you guys trying your best to solve my problem!! You guys rock!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Works pretty well and I have had a good experience so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's not just a app, it's a complete solution to a synced journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great journalling app. Keeps getting better"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"💯 ＼(^o^)／ [🚶]-[🚙🚛🚚🚒] It's easy to save images to the diary and then complete your entry! Your doing great! Just keep on trucking!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it every week. Easy to use. Functionality is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Life is all about the journey, not the destination."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great for trip memorries! Been using this for 2 years now and love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have used the basic version for about 3 years now and it's time to be very helpful in keeping a journal and record of my travels"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it! Helps me with notes I need for myself"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's minimal, simple and efficient. Good user interface. Loved it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use this app and enjoy every moment"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Creative and easy and fun to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does what it is supposed to and very well designed"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The app has a horrible camera function. Other than that, it does what it promises, and does it fairly well :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I like that I can add photos and video/audio files. It's like a scrapbook diary. I wish there weren't restrictions on types of attachments in a single entry. But I just make a separate entry for each, no biggie"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Early days but good so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far i think this app is really good. For what i need it for i don't require the premium. But its so good that if i do require the premium i will totally purchase it. I recommend this app for daily journaling. I also love the pass code feature. Keep all you entries private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love to write and this gives me a way to write/type."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a wonderful way for me to put my thoughts into words and not have to worry about someone getting into it. No more paper journals for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've really enjoyed using this app as an alternative way to write stuff down without broadcasting it to the entire planet. It's a lot more relaxing and I don't have to worry as much about having my thoughts analysed by marketing firms or political strategists."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Update - I love my purchased Premium & have moved into a new phone. I cannot determine how to get it transferred... I won't sit down & formally write in a journal b/c I'm convinced I don't have time w/too many obligations. But my Samsung Note phone is always w/me & moments are always available to put down my thoughts & feelings in my Journey app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is perfect for me"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I needed it to do exactly what it does and have no issues whatsoever with the functions of this app. Overall happy enough"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for about three years. This is amazing diary. In all that time, I've never think of using any other app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! You can tag entries with categories that you create. Records 
time, place and weather of each entry. Best of all, it's password 
protected! One of my all-time favorite apps!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Just downloaded this app, so far so good. Is it possible to make, see and edit the entries while in Google Drive, for example on a laptop? many thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Even without paying... Great app to keep journalling whatever and wherever you go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The premium version is brilliant and helps me blog on the go too. Love this app, I've had it for about 2 years."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely app. Wish I started using it a long time ago. Way more friendly than Day One."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app for jotting down random thoughts anywhere, anytime. Simple, but has everything needed to capture your thoughts."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very helpful ... since I'm beginning to have a hard time remembering what I do everyday!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I give it a 10. Writing is a great way to relieve stress, 
an then go back an read what you wrote you will be 
amazed..🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for my style of journalling. Quick, easy, and can include pictures 
and other details."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome. I wanted an app I could use with my phone, tablet, laptop and desktop. Journaling is a habit I always wanted to develop. With this app, it becomes fun as well. Cloud storage is brilliant! Twitter, WordPress, and Tumblr support just adds to the value. Some requests to the developers: 1) Please add Facebook, Google+, Blogger, and LinkedIn support as well. As many publishing sites as possible."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its easier to do no matter where you are, you don't need to turn your light 
on to write in your journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app features are great. However, as I have been using this app for a 
while it is taking up all my internal memory. I can't move it to the SD 
card and when I clear the data in the app settings on my phone it just 
resynchs all the data back to the internal memory. Unless I can fix this 
problem I will no longer be able to use the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this app since last year nice app love it, don't matter wat 
device I have I always get my memory back when I download it, I am not a 
premium user but am loving it most important no ads in free version I would 
like different colored text"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i liked the app ....app is awesome...but premium membership is costlier for 
me...i want to purchase premium membership...i can pay 100rs for it....app 
is good...best app in entire play store....may be it will be my first app 
which i want and will purchase in future for sure...but not right 
now...best app...thanks for developing it..it is like my friend..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Diaro has free web access to a wonderful outlay. With Journey they want you 
to pay way too much for a desktop app. Why not give free access to web 
version like Diaro? I've spent too much on Android apps that get abandoned 
after a while."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First class journey keeper. Supporting more than 4 pics would be even 
greater. But not able to sync in main land China. Please help to solve it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am using this as personal diary and organizer... easy to use... easy to 
track back but I prefer the old school method... using pen n paper... hahaha"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great way to keep memories with a nicely designed UI and UX to work and 
view with."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Ace"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for more than 2 years and it made me fall in love 
with writing in a more personal light. I truly recommend this to everyone 
who needs a handy journal and just can't wait to express their thoughts 
whenever and wherever."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Useful even offline"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Why is 'the record' so compelling? Yesterday's content can be so boring. 
What is the past but present memory? Maybe the record that we make in 
journaling is a reflection of an existence Beyond Time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app for documenting life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Now I can use underscore for tags as expected.. Better if you can simplify 
the creating an entry process by making it more user friendly with 
suggested activities, moods and etc. Also it would be useful for us to 
measure our day to day life with generated statistics according to entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An amazing app. that has helped me make some positive steps forward in life 
honestly. The ability to set a notification/reminder daily etc. Is perfect 
for me!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awe"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome Daily Keeper"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great tool to gauge your mental health, trauma, successes, and failures 
on a day to day or week to week basis. I didn't bugger around with the free 
version because using the chrome applet was a requirement for me just as 
much as security"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is very user-friendly. It's easy to add photos as a remembrance of 
each day's agenda. I like it very much."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Should be able to co edit it with the person you want to. Also if we want 
to add more than one picture at once, it is not possible currently. And The 
desktop version can't even make a back date entry"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app allows content to be saved on Google Drive. Simple and clean 
interface!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app. But I still can't access the finger print though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, can write your thoughts down at any place and it's all going to 
be synced. I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very clear to use and reliable allows you to focus on the journal rather 
than the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love being able to journal my thoughts to Papa God."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Hate that I have to get the premium just to have some kind of security on 
my app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good diary app with a sleek design. Very useful for researching your 
crush."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app! Super easy to use and great features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful! Love how simple it is to use it and it has a very clean 
interface to it. The statistics portion is very interesting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I write my thoughts in it daily. It really help me and o do like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I purchased add on premium for £4 something it doesn't allow me to change 
the style of the text which is really disappointing slightly on the boring 
side not able to change colours of the font or style of the fonts even the 
theme it's all blue I like the layout need to make things more fun and 
colourful I'm the type of person colour has to be everywhere it changes my 
mood disappointing with not being able to change the font or colours ever 
after purchasing premium add ons"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A perfect journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"a nice app to keep track of all your. memories and moments"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been journaling for my girls daily lives since there are three months 
old they are now 15 and 12 I do this because I love it and when things get 
crazy all we have to do is go back and read our journals and put things in 
perspective. It allows us to slow down the day and to really look at what 
we've done ane shared. I share this because it's important that I have a 
journaling app it's easy to use. This app is just that easy to use but with 
a lot of features and great functionality. Thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really simple to use and really effective to document your days"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Pretty decent app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I switched to Journey after using paid versions of other apps. Even the 
free version is good enough. This is the best app so far. Since the day 
entries we make are so valuable, we must choose an app that has a good 
pricing model (so the company survives for our lifetime) and an ability to 
export to PDF if you want to switch to other app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app. I love the way you can tag , add photos and 
videos and so much more. Plus it syncs across devices , so if you see 
something during the day you can snap a photo , add it , then write about 
it later on your pad. I was once told by a medical professional how 
therapeutic keeping a diary can be. I have found this to be good advice. So 
even if you've only Umm'd and Ahh'd about keeping a diary before , then 
this should be the app you use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app except possibly need to have line/arrow linking the places 
visited in sequence."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, IT'S so much better than I ever thought it would be!!! 
Much more than a journal...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exceeded my expectations"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Honestly gr8 hit nearly all my criteria"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome Diary App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I would rate this 5 stars, but somehow this app interferes with the swipe 
and autocorrect features on my keyboard, making it difficult to make long, 
accurate entries. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the app, but that 
didn't help. Please fix it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Great for travel. Also to track anything!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like this"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish you could add more photos per entery."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best productivity app so far"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A true journey"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awson thing when you get older yo can look back when you were yonger"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it goes across many devices and platforms. yay!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I use it as a simple, no frills journal. The only issue is the offer to 
upgrade which appears every now and then."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Since I started this journal I've been able to let go of a lot of things 
that have happened to me and then able to focus more on my duties together"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app... Best artificial intelligence that will help me to memorize 
my everyday moments...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app, just keep posting my location different"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Use this app to track what I eat without worrying about counting calories 
that you have to do with those other apps."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hands down the best journaling app. EDIT: Complained a little about 
markdown not working as expected, but that was my bad, its awesome. The 
only things i'd love to see working properly are iframes/embedded youtube 
videos as they dont load. But its not a problem, just a nice to have for 
devs trying to stretch the limits of a journaling app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app, easy to across multiple platforms."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Helps me take out frustration and not take it out on people lol"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need it to. No complaints. Use it every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Geat app. Good for looking back on memories. I moved over to Journey after 
using Day One for two years as this app supports android user much better. 
Good Web version. I do miss the ability to insert photos within the text 
from Day One though."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Must have app for daily journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app, been using this app for months. Can you please add an option 
to search in the entries. As sometimes it happens that you forget the date 
an event happened but you remember what you wrote, so a search button for 
the same would be very useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm really enjoying the app so far. It's very very simple and intuitive, 
but I wish I could group some entries (for example, by week) and write 
weekly and monthly reports. I also wish I could give titles to the entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Although I'm using this app from past one and half year and keep using it 
forever. But the day counter is stop at 353 days and password feature need 
little attention because when I install this app on another phone then 
after login from google it doesn't ask for password which I set in journey 
app earlier. Guy's can you please provide cloud password feature for total 
security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for quick or detailed journaling. Allows you to track your 
mood and can provide you stats based on weather, mood, location, and 
activity. Easy to use, and I love that I can tag my entries to easily look 
back at topics vs feeling etc. Highly recommend this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loving this app to keep a quick record of key events and photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. simple to use, attractive presentation"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything is awesome, except it is confusing at first but when u get the 
hang of it. It works awesome🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very good app to keep alive your journeys memory. Loved it. But the image 
attachment facility should be minimum 5, I think so."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Have been using journey for years! Still wish there was an option for an 
auto journaling feature that records the weather and a photo from your 
gallery for the dates I forget to record the events! It would additionally 
be useful to have daylio IN journaly rather than bouncing back and forth 
between the app to record pictures in one app and mood in the other for 
them to integrate later."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice so far. No force closes *thumbs up*"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent design...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I looked for something with a password and it just asked for my Google 
account"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to express my thoughts via photos and talk n text. Keeps 
everything well organized. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've never been big on writing but I find journaling very therapeutic. I 
love that I can save everything and add pics as part of the entries. The 
app itself is beautiful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice clean journaling interface. It needs a couple convenience updates like 
being able to edit a previous entry by clicking on the page rather than 
finding the pen button. Overall a good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"you are awesome and I have purchased the premium version. have tried other 
journaling apps but nothing can beat journey thus fat. I really can't wait 
to see what Journey has to offer in the future. keep it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"please add a feature like keeping notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app.. Good UI"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In tandem with Daylio, i'm doing it as a habit now. I love the app as it is."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Seems pretty good so far. Good for lazy diary keepers !"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I've been using Journey since 2016 and have never had an issue until 
recently. I had to clean my phone and start fresh. Since I'd purchased the 
premium version I wasn't worried about getting my precious memories back at 
all. However after reinstalling the app, I found I'd lost four months of 
entries including precious memories I can't get back. I emailed support a 
few times and never received a response. While I continue to use the app 
because I enjoy the way it's set up, I no longer trust it the way I did 
months ago. I use another app as a backup before posting to this one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was looking for an app to document things that I don't want to forget. 
Things about my kids and about my life. Things that I would probably forget 
otherwise. The app also allows for syncing on the cloud and so far it's 
worked perfectly. I also use it between my phone and a Windows PC. No 
problems so far. It's nice when things work the way they're supposed to. 
Well worth the price and I don't usually write reviews either"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy UI; lots of options; great support/responsiveness from developer."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful for writing down important stuff"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great way to express feeling"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app, nice ui and easy to use. But the way to select, add and handle 
photos to existing entries should (must) be improved, as is it now it is 
very cumbersome and time consuming. It should be an easy way to rearrange 
and sort the photos and it should be possible to select several photos at 
the same time. I bought the premium version anyway to support the 
developers, I really hope they can fix/improve the app. Keep up the good 
work 👍🏻"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice clean interface. Easy to use with lots of useful - and optional - 
features. Sad the dark theme is behind paywall, but no other complaints ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple to use, stores most of your memories, syncs across the devices well 
and adding content is easy. It has all that I need in a diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome journal, love the pics, video, and voice recorder"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This apps for me, its good enough.. The best one.. Its worth to grab 
premium..to write my daily thoughts.. And love to review it again.. I 
really recommended for those wanna be an author.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent! Best I've tried. Until now it meets all my expectations: being 
able to write ,but also to attach audio recording of my voice and also 
photos. 10 photos! What about attaching to an entry even a video. Really 
good app. I've been trying to find one like this for the last 4 months. 
Thank you guys and keep up the good work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"i use this app and lottt, mostly to like write/type and it helps a lot, to 
just at any moment i wanna write, story, my feelings and so on, it helps, i 
love it alot, im glad i started to use it in the first place! and i love 
how i can add pictures depending on the writing and add how like i feel 
when i write it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"They are trying to make a move to a subscription service since that's the 
only sustainable business model, but meh. Good app though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Can add pictures, text, it automatically syncs and labels 
with date time and location. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, exactly what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This app. Had everything I've been looking for in a digital journal. The 
lock is a must for me and my thoughts. Safe from prying eyes. Thank you for 
a very thought out app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So I said why I'm returning the app in my refund request"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Would love to keep the tracks kept in Google Fit and add to the days entry. 
However this is an excellent app to record our travels in our motorhome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it. Keeping journal was never so easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best part it has automatic sync so you don't have to worry about losing the 
notes.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app for saving your memories in a new way"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I needed something simple to use, and this has done it. Autosave is a big 
help when you are deep in thought. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Only diary app I've used. For years I have kept a physical journal but this 
app makes it feel like it's the right time to move digital."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It took some time to get in to the habit. But now it is the the that i use 
consistently every day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loooved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is really helpful.. I've never been so close to myself as I'm 
now...For a good mental health and knowing yourself give this app a try😎"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A very simple app to keep notes about my days, exactly what i wanted."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good job guys"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me write my blog"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic way to journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the simple design"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well this app has been very helpful for me for quite some time now. I have 
been using this app for keeping notes in time of emergency. Very easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's very user friendly and relaxing. I find myself dozing off as I unload 
all my busy thoughts into this journal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Not sure about this app yet"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is the best in the market. But had it given the feature of writing with 
stylus as in a real paper, it would have been better..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good excilent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps me to note my memories a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Working well so far!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this journal. One of the best apps of its kind. I'll be devastated 
if it ever goes away"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best app I could find of this and its super private. I would 
definitely recommend this and there is hardly no ads."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An app that is like a scrap book. Best travel app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been documenting my life for years with this app, love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"How can I change my email Id"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Muy buena aplicación. No sirve la cámara en la aplicación, pero tomo la 
foto por fuera y la importa sin problema"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Incredible app works perfectly and the extras are great"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've used this app to write down the important events in my life. 
Everything is backed up so I'll never lose them, and organized perfectly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best if free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sorted through different journals...this is the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The app is fine, but the price structure is clear as mud. Unclear what's 
covered by the special offer. Windows app priced separately, but they don't 
tell you..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"The app itself is perfect but my issue is that I was using this on my old

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"There are a couple of things needs to be improved such as reorganizing 
tags, arranging journals by month or by tag and creating folder. But 
overall quality os great. I like they upgrade functions over the time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easily one of my favourite apps! I love having a journal handy wherever I 
am. The best thing is no one knows your writing in it, you could be texting 
for all they know. The quotes that show up from time to time are nice to. I 
use it like a little travel log. The design isn't at all hard on your eyes, 
very nice blue and white color."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"No reminder sound. Poor support."

interface, has the features I need, and then some!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has a neat UI. The tags are a useful addition. I've tried a few others 
as well. I find this more user friendly. Just a suggestion- how about 
organizing the entries for a day in a vertical slide column. Slide left and 
it the next day. Slide right and its the previous day's entries. Kudos 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Layout is neat. Easy to recollect. Important tools have been 
loaded even on free version. Thank you guys for your this nice product."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice little daily journal"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Extremely shady business practice. Will first popup with a ""50% offer"" to 
sell you cloud access for 15 dollars. Then says ""DONT CLICK AWAY, this 
offer will only appear once!"" If you click away and come back to it, it is 
now 5 dollars. What?!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Would be amazing if it is available on desktop/website version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Convenient"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, very simple to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy tool to record the day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal writing app I've been able to find online. Though they have 
downgraded it a bit over the years. Previously the printed pdf s would have 
perfect photo quality, but the new versions give smaller sized files with 
lower photo qualities."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice most probably will buy the full version if I continue writing as 
I do now"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Good app would give it 5 starts but it's really bothering me that it's 
always lose track of where I was writing whenever I switch app. I need to 
reopen the current day, scroll down to the bottom or whereever I was 
writing. That could be corrected easily I guess, else I'm looking for an 
other software"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was very surprised and how complete and simple it was to keep a Daily 
Journal. This is something that was new to me and quite exciting after I 
started."

a really positive impact on my mental health"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So easy to use and great to look back on."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Nice feature to add a picture for an entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Just getting started, not sure if I'm doing anything wrong but it seems 
like it's limited the number of pictures that are available to choose from 
within the day and it will not filter the picture gallery to pictures taken 
within the day you took the pictures if you are adding an entry for a past 
date. Overall easy to use app and works well except for the limitation 
deceived above.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing. It really helps me express my thoughts."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Some times when we want to store our emotions audio recording is necessary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy using this app to keep a bit of a digital journal. I am 
using the free option, but it meets my needs just great. I add a picture to 
my entry to remind me of that day as well as type whatever I want! I love 
it :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice and easy, I use it to track what I'm doing it have done during g the 
day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it. Use it almost daily. We'll worth it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic App and well worth going premium. I think it's a great way to 
document everything that life can dish up, good, bad or just plain ugly 
without the whole world seeing."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not familiar with or have used some of the features of the app. But the app 
is still great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app let's me save short stories that I write/read on the web, amazing 
UI and great features!! Love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far, the app works like it says it does. I can use this anytime I want, 
and it starts when it needs to. I would prefer if it had password 
encryption- don't want my entries to fall in the wrong hands. Otherwise, 
great job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"All around great journal app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great. I enjoy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good except that font setting eg bold and italics need to be easier"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I just downloaded the app a few days ago and I really like it. Using it as 
a daily life journal. The feature that allows you to integrate with your 
Google account so you can it use your laptop and type is really what sold 
me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderfully and beautifully simple, yet with exceptional functionality! I 
have journaled for years, but haven't been able to keep up with writing as 
often as I'd like. While I love paper journals, this app is ridiculously 
practical! I find myself writing far more often than in a paper journal 
simply because I pretty much always have my phone with me. Write an entry 
in the waiting room of your doctor's office, or from your Air bnb on 
vacation (without packing anything extra)! This is the perfect journal 
format for aspiring minimalists: everything is in one secure, easy-to-use 
platform. Additionally, I love that you can export entries AND switch 
between writing/viewing on your phone and computer. BUT: the BEST feature, 
iny opinion, is the ease with which you can attach photos. Just a wonderful 
journal of the future! Thanks so much for enriching my life with this 
awesome technology!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So simple! This app is so helpful! It lets you write down whatever you want 
and add photos. You can also keep your private thoughts protected with a 
password. Highly recommend!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very good!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Can't you do °C and miles for British people, instead of km?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for private journaling with the option to download your journal to 
local machine."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I usually don't write reviews but I have to for this one. This app is a 
great way to keep track of what I'm doing in life. I've always wanted to 
start a diary or Journal but I hate writing it down, so I never did. But I 
always needed something to get my thoughts out. So then I got this app and 
everything has been easy for me. I really like it! 5 Stars! amazing!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This App is marvelous. I think this is best ever i have seen. If Bullet 
options are there while writing dairies,,, then it would be incomparable 
and invaluable."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Hope you guys will add more fonts that are compatible with Vietnamese."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"absolutely amazing and easy to use!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Shouldn't have to pay for a diary. Should of say that from the get go."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like the quick journals to look back on and remind me of things ... I 
write a lot.. hope I don't ever run out of space.. I love it dates it daily 
!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best Application for Capture our life in a diary."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Amazing app, but we should be able to attach more stuff, it's ridiculous 
when the limit is just one video"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Easy to use and safe.. because you can back it up"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good app for journal entry. I really loved it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to track a day by day/ week by week progress!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I appreciate how I can easily express myself with the tools in the app. The 
premium was worth it for the amount of bold and italics I use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"The voice notes should have been for free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish there were fewer self-ads early on, as it somewhat detracts from the 
app. Maybe only show upgrade ads to frequent users"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Journey is a great app, which really helps you to keep track of your life. 
The design is smooth and the back up option makes sure that your entries 
are beyond your device."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It helps motivate me to make entries more often. It is very easy to use and 
quite versatile."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very happy with it, been using it for a year"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"straightforward"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good and easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journal app! 👍👍 Love it 💚"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what I was looking for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I find this app to be the best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Only routine entries. Would have liked entries in different heading s"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use. Love it."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this app to track my health issues."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love the app ... Helps me remember my day to day activities and what was 
special about them"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and effective so far. Just getting started with it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"They thought of everything. Definitely worth paying for and keeping for the 
long haul."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app works perfectly for me. The premium version is worth it if you can 
afford it. I will certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a 
track of their life. Journey for PC is a bit expensive for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A must have app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"In a all in all a great app. I use it on daily basis and it helps my life a 
ton. One suggestion that I have is not allowing export your journal easily 
with the premium account. As you know, security is the biggest concern for 
users of journaling app. Also, I am concerned with if the input is 
encrypted in the database, because, you know, i dont want anyone who has 
access to the database to be able to see what i write, like the developer. 
Anyways, a great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love this app! I would love it so much if can include an option 
""select from album"" because I want to record/write my past experiences in 
the past. Hope you will include it in this app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just what i was looking for my thesis.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"First time diary keeper. Let's see, you can make entries for the current 
date/ time. Add photos and location, and a few other tags can be added. 
There's voice dictation if you can train the Google voice keyboard for your 
own voice. For what I want, this little app does it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like that you can add several pictures to an entry but I don't like it is 
limited (to a maximum of 10). I also want to be able to add both video's as 
well as pictures not either or. I like the simplicity of the app. I have 
premium. It would be nice if basic text fonts (bold, italic, etc) could be 
added without using html code. It would also be great if the app would give 
the capability to adjust the format of the pdf. So I can decide how the 
pictures and text are placed, like an album. Overall I am very happy with 
it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Night mode feature should be free..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My life in a book... Amazing app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's bloody groovy, mates!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good nice app...."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very handy. Would like for it to be able to back up to my existing cloud 
instead of having to pay for cloud service"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very nice app.. user friendly.. I like it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Looks Awesome Entertaining and Fun to Use"

basic account without any charge. Best app for digital diary lovers ❤"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Its what I use. Safe, easy, unique."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've never been a diary journal girl but I love this app. It reminds me to 
sit and gather my thoughts. Very useful and private. I appreciate that."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Much easier to backup than Day Journal. That's critical for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Thanks 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app. Highly recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for whatever you wish to use it for."

all the essentials required for a simple diary writer without any ads. So, 
thank you, developers, for the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really like it, wanted to start a diary and this is ideal, also can do 
picture diary and now audio but I like the writing so I have something to 
look back on.👍👏💯🏋💪👊😎😀"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a beautiful app, that's the summary of it! I'd love it if you guys

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best Journal ever"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An easy way to capture my thoughts and effectively document them. I've been keeping a journal now for many years but this app makes it all so much more efficient, to be able to instantly record my thoughts and even ultimately print them out as part of my permanent record."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. I used it everyday to record my newborn's growth and milestone. 
🙂"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful this is just wow"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I would give 5 stars, but it isn't letting me sign in to my other device 
and I paid for premium. I have a Blackberry phone, and when I install the 
app, it works, but won't let me sign in to my premium account. Please help."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't say enough about this Journey app. I genuinely like it, one of my 
favorite apps. I enjoy writing about memorable family events and other 
important issues. It has it all organized by date and time. Awesome!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect app, I paid for full access, night view is great, useful. Just want to ask please add function to five star to some entries.  Later edit, thanks for adding star function for some edits"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice simple app to keep a journal. I use the cloud service so type 
up an entry on a PC but would like to have more options (such as mood 
entry) be available across different platforms. But 5* anyway"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Loved it... especially bcz I got my all documents even after back up my 
phone 👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Your app is good. Can I backup all journals related to only 1 particular 
tag into document if I buy premium"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm an avid note taker and recently started journaling. It's very 
convenient to journal from any device and attach photos. I love the extra 
features like hashtags so I can organize my entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Nice! Easy to use, uploadable, works great!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent and simple"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app, been using it for a long time now. Doesn't seem to have 
any problems besides the storage space it consumes.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome application...had a few problems in the beginning...all sorted 
now... keep up the good work."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"It's a great app just not catered to me. I wrote multiple times asking for 
a refund and no one got back to me. Can I get a bit of love here?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it's easily accessible, and has enough resources within the application to 
make it personable as if it were on a peace of paper."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app. Helps me record each of my travel trips and can get synched to 
my Google account!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I have the text size set to gigantic but on the main screen the text is 
still very small. This seems to be a bug in that the text size doesn't 
change."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the most simple and elegant journal apps. Super easy"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"OLD: The app is good. I use premium on both my smartphone and computer. 
I'll give it 3 stars because I think there is still potential in terms of 
creativity. It is a simple app but I wish I could individualize my text 
more! UPDATE: Ok, so now I found out how to change font and individualize 
your text. For that you have to use commands like *text* or # text.... Love 
it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A beautiful app, I just love it, no adds and it's helps with everything 
it's supposed to do. Keeping track and all. I just hope future versions 
will enhance privacy by encryption of access either fingerprint or password 
either should do well"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is very good. Use very useful. Thanks"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app i've used. Nice free cloud backup."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Definitely the easiest way to journal that I have found. I love being able

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A great way to tract our thoughts & experiences. Thank you team for such a 
great app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"I cannot stop my app from syncing on Tablet. It is using up my cellular 
data. What happened to Wi-Fi only? When I connect to internet using hotspot 
it recognises it as WiFi?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"App is great for what it does. Workflow is good, is reasonably stable. 
Biggest area where it could be improved is to be able to share full content 
with select family members over the internet. Also even though it is 
supposed to be able to post to FB it does not."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love keeping track of life, and this is great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful! I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's lovely I just wish more on the privacy thing. Like everytime, cuz I 
could go to something else and then my sis can click on it from recent apps 
and it won't require a password. Other then that I love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"works fine so far. recommend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really good having it on the cloud, just a shame that font sizes are so 
small"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I didn't think I would use it and like it this much. Really good app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really love it! But lacks the polish feel of day one. I just feel it to 
be a little choppy. But I really do hope you guys come up with better user 
experience. Otherwise love the app so far. Please add the feature of 
choosing the cover photo for the post! It's annoying having to delete and 
then add again photos on order to match the photo I want as cover."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not bad"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I am recording my progress through some body therapy and 
it's amazing. Seriously considering lifetime membership :-)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Wanted a simple journal app on my phone, tablet, and computer. This one 
looked promising. Installed on the phone and computer to start. Before I 
could even begin trying it, it started asking for money. Couldn't use it 
without paying. Sent email to support team for help, no response. 
Uninstalled, complete waste of time."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome diary app... Purchased pro and didn't regret it. Nextcloud 
integration would be a nice feature to add."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Dude, get premium because its worth. LOVING THIS APP!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My Story & Bussiness Diary.. This app is my part 👌👌👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"[premium user] I can write on paper and attach an image. It syncs across 
with the computer app and is stored in Google Drive. It's worth using."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Going to have to get premium though"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is is great app that makes journalling feel very natural and easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a really great app, especially where you can add photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It very helpful and has many functions. The new version only has the option 
of Google sign in, I can't sign in with my Microsoft account, which has all 
my all data's and entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Not bad but would like more feature for the free version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love it so much. But please consider making a ""share"" option. I'd love it 
to share w my travel pal."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I did nit expect to love writing in an app journal, but I do."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the search feature. Super easy to type in a key word and pull up 
each instance. Very helpful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It's a very good way to organize thoughts, big ones and 
little ones."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Accessable. Just enough of the right features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Had no bugs, premium is definitely worth it if you can 
afford it. App is perfectly fine without it. Good for venting and keeping 
private memories. And even if you loose/reinstall the app, as long as you 
have it logged into the same Google account everything will stay on your 
account. Way better than all the other journal apps out there. Just wish 
you could have like a calendar, and be able to categorise days by certain 
emotion and or colours."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helps me remember important things"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use, and nice features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's great to use and easy."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Tried many and this seems the best for my needs"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is a decent journaling app. I like that you can add photos, video, or 
mp3. I wish you could add all these to one entry but unfortunately you have 
to choose one. If developers could change that to an option it would be 5 
stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Lovely stuff, not my words but the words of Shaking Stevens"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I like the idea that you can print it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been wanting a daily journal app on my phone and PC for a while now. 
I'm very happy to find this one. It's pretty much what I was looking for 
with the added bonus of attaching a lot of meta data to each entry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it.. specially the atlas.. I write everywhere and it adds little flags 
to the places I have written stuff..!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very nice app easy to use thank you"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really liked this. It even has fingerprint Id which I really liked. I 
wish there were more fonts but the fact that they had font options was 
pretty cool already. They have a calender to find entries, and mood entry. 
No ads either. Defs reccomend"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app to Foster a good habit. The free version allows you to 
keep a journal and reminds you each day. I'll probably unlock at some 
point, but so far it's great."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has a nice clean interface and is perfect for jotting down your 
thoughts and musings. Good work and please don't introduce any obtrusive 
ads in future like competitors."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, I love it. You can insert pictures and share with friends. The 
reminder and the quick write feature helps me remember to write in it every 
day."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This makes me happy. Great job!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's perfect 👌👌"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Perfect for writing lovers"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"It has my address incorrect, how do I correct it?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app has been great for keeping a journal. No complaints at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better spending as much time on Journey as possible than social media..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Well i buy the premium one... that explain everything... 😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for some years and made many precious journals 
about my life. It's easy to use and offers many useful features. I wish 
that developer could add handwriting feature in the future."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple to use. I like it a lot"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app, just annoying how it tries to push it's premium version"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So good dood."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The only journal app that ive used and don't even want to change it to 
another app. It has all the features a person would need. Cheers to the 
developer!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"No need to worry about your siblings or crazy roommates stealing your diary 
anymore!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy being able to add pictures to the posts and its nice to have 
a journal at my finger tips when ever the need arises. Love all the 
features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helpful to keep track of daily activities and to do lists."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great layout and very user friendly. Feels like a real diary and great 
features like pictures, location and weather. Just as a questions though, 
if I upgrade to another phone does all my entries transfer to my new phone 
if I log into my google account or do I need premium to do that?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"No auto correct keyboard. Tried to print, but each entry is a separate 
page! Needed the entries for a medical journal. Useless."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Enjoying using this app for documenting our holiday."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best app for write diary"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Amazing app i have also purchased the premium plan and it is worth it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Not had it long but really like it so far! Love that you can add pictures 
etc and the search function, so easy to use the whole app! Just what I was 
looking for, will upgrade to the premium version for the extras"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app, best journal app I ever used. Thank you :)"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really cool app.handy an quick to take notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Use it everyday. Like that you can attach pictures."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It has great features. Good interface"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Of the journaling apps I have tried, I like this one the best. There are a 
few minor things that could use improvement, but I honestly feel like it 
would be nitpicky to even mention them here. Long story short: I highly 
recommend this app to anyone seeking a journaling app that is easy to use, 
without any unnecessary, flowery extras that detract from the simple 
experience of working. It DOES include some extra features, including auto 
meta-data like location, weather, etc., and the option to add your current 
mood, activity, etc, and (a must for me) the ability to create tags that 
can later be used to sort and search through your entries."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Sure thing this is a good app. I used it to record dairy and stories with 
relevant photos. Easy access from all devices. Works offline as well."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great place to record your thoughts. Just dump your problems, stories, 
aspirations, anything you want right there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's wonderful. The app has a user- friendly layout. The instant tag-making 
is useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"not many activities to choose"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Easy to edit. Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Better than carrying a notebook and pen"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Simple yet best"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's really amazing app. Before it I use to keep journal in my diary 1 time 
a day, but due to its media attachment and location tracking made me crazy. 
Now I journal 5-6 times a day. Now I'm thinking for purchasing its premium 
version But I want to know if the charges are for permanent purchasing or 
its yearly based because it's not mention clearly there."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"A good journaling app. Simple to use with a clean interface."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is surely one of the best app ever made. I've tried buying fancy 
notebooks to record my day but I couldn't just get into it. I've also tried 
several diary apps but immediately gave up for its poor feature. Then, I 
found this one! Even though I don't have the premium, its conveniency is 
still there. Simple but great! Edit: It keeps getting better every update. 
I love how it doesn't have any ads in it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. I haven't tried printing from it yet, but it helps me keep 
little blurbs about my kids, life, etc."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"•Awesome journaling app. Premium purchase was worth it. •Devs please add 
the ability to upload multiple photos,videos and audio files in the same 
entry. And also please add the ability to use tags in the journey cloud 
version. Anyway the app is very good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using this for years and was so happy with it I bought the premium 
version. It is simple to use and easy to set up a reminder."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Simple and easy to use design. Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this to write a dialog to my wife everyday because we are a part of 
Worldwide Marriage Encounter and it's really easy to just write, send it to 
her and if I ever need to go back to it and look through my entries, it's 
all displayed nicely."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I LOVE the privacy and lock security."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a great app to have to collect your thoughts into."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great UX. As simple as needed – with all the features I seem to need."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is almost what I have been looking for. A proper electronic substitute 
for a traditional dairy. Really well thought!!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Perfect for what I needed. Only a little disappointed that the desktop 
version is a separate fee."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Updating my review after using this app for over a year: It's a fantastic 
app. It has apps on multiple platforms (which you purchase individually), 
which are worth the money, though the chrome app isn't as fluid as the Mac 
native app. It's perfect for journaling, and exports decent data, though I 
wish it gave an option for XML or JSON export for more flexibility. 
Developer is responsive, open to ideas, and working on features. App has 
definitely contributed positively to my life."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's an amazing tool for documenting and also helping to cope or 
share. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Asking me if I want to write in my journal gets annoying really quick. 
Totally not what I expected at all."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic cross-platform journaling app. I love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Is the premium permanent? It doesn't tell It anywhere"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I was a loyal paid user for over a year, but unfortunately, I can't keep this app. Even after you select the option to not store images/videos in the gallery, copies are still preserved in the app data on your phone.   If you journal a couple times a week with even brief video clips, then any 32g phone (most have ~22g real storage space) will fill up and become unusable within a year.   I have no idea why there isn't an option to just erase the local storage and let the cloud store the big files. Some of us don't care whether we can view all the content immediately from the phone; I'd much rather be able to collect it without worrying about space, then view the actual content on a big screen later.   Even just an option for storing on SD card would work, but that is not offered, either.   As it is right now, I guess you need a 64+gb phone to use this long-term. I'll be finding a new app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Over it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great cross platform app that works. Not all features work on 
each version but I notice it is being actively worked on. It's got me 
hooked. I'm writing more than ever before."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I would give this app a try 5 stars, if it had pop up reminds. I use to use 
this app a lot and then I found another app which has pop reminders."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great. Very helpful to organize my thoughts, document my experiences, and 
track my goals."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this App♥️."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app allowed me to write down and experience past moments of my life. I 
can easily find old entries using tags and can look back and see all the 
days in which I submitted one."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep track of everything I wish. Markup syntax could be 
improved as well as the checkmarks. And it is strange to pay for the 
Premium on Android but have to buy a different license on Chrome. All over 
anyway it is nice and easy to use and sync."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good apps for reasonable price"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This apps is helpful for me, especially when I need a catarsis so I can 
write a diary safely"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"it has amazing features its the best diary app available on playstore i 
love this app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"To record my life journey..This app is pretty perfect..I am thankful to the 
team journey for making such a beautiful application.. Gratitude 💐💐👌"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it👌👌nyc app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of the best."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love its location defined"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Actually i will give 5 stars, but i need to get a answer for one 
quesion.... All my entries are backed up in google drive you say means, how 
mych space does it consume? In a year? For 10 years full of entries????.... 
Also, i didnt found any folders of ur app on google drive.... Please 
answer... Im waiting for your reply.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Been using it for a few days now and it looks very promising, I haven't had 
any issues and the long term happiness graph and often together interest 
me. Only thing that I would really like is to shift the end time of days 
because I like to recap my day at 12am-2am before I go to sleep."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Obviously great app..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this way of journaling."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app. Very simple to use. Was exactly what I was looking 
for."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is awesome"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for over a year...it works well for me."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"My favorite app for daily log."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best out there for this job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"Found the app clunky. Also wouldn't sync across devices. Asked for refund 
but was asked for screen shots and told to read extensive returns.policy!! 
Should have gone to Amazon!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app. Simple and easy to use. You don't need a lot of features in an 
app meant for journaling. This app has just enough without trying to 
overcomplicate things."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great app that helps write our daily journals everyday. I love this 
app.."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a good app I don't like that it asking me to upgrade all the time but 
I like that it's convenient."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app I love using it everyday. It syncs between my phone my 
computer and my Android Wear. And it's really cool because I can import 
pictures and videos and voice messages and anything that you know remind me 
of my day. Plus it's location-based"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I wish you bring back the feature wherein we can publish on Facebook"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app. I faced some issues with it, but then the super active 
support team helped me out.. Awesome app!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome.. i like it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I believe that journaling fills my life with joy and heals my spirit. You 
should try it. Will reveal things about you... that you haven't discovered 
and didn't know existed. Highly recommended! 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Awesome app to note your memories."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good for taking notes..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I downloaded this app to keep my days from running together and improve my 
memory. So I basically is it as a journal. All and all, I enjoy this app, 
and it has definitely improved my life! Also adding photos and videos to 
them makes the experience even better!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Love the app. It does what I want it to do. The only thing I wish was 
possible was to export it (not just one at a time) onto a .pdf or other 
document. Otherwise, great app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"So far so good. Time will tell whether it is worth the subscription."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like how this journal can be accessed by multiple devices and is not 
proprietary to just my phone."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very easy to use and manage!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is exactly what I was looking for. I am very pleased. I can update on 
either my phone or tablet which is awesome. I can attach pictures. Great App"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best way to keep in touch with your inner self and record the story 
behind the pictures and save it for eternity. Highly recommended app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"I'm not that crazy about the app these days, and for several months now. 
It's sluggish, doesn't start my entries with capital letters, and doesn't 
treat the entries as true text, won't make spaces between words, and is 
very slow or non existent when trying to delete words or phrases. Wish I 
adnt purchased the premium."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love itttt"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. Easy to record stuffs and the geotag is good."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"There are no ads and it is a great app. I use it every day to show my 
feelings and it is like someone to talk to. I love how it has a lock so no 
one, even my friends can get into it. I strongly agree that you should get 
this."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best diary app in the world! Easy to use! Love the fact the idea that you 
can back it up to your Google account!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy and convenient to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Makes it easy to record my day"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, no ads and works very well. Simple GUI and most of the features 
aren't gimmicks."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"The new update promised for microphone option to audio record. But that is 
only for premium version! That's not fair. Not everyone can afford it by 
money. Please do something for free version people. That's why two stars."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A must have app if you write Journals daily"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love JOURNEY! Its straightforward, with an elegant design. You can opt to 
share or stay private. You can add mood faces, stickers, photos of the 
moment, and now even audio if wanted. Truly satisfying."

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I think if it had an option for uploading video which is already shot. It 
will be best and I would have loved it. I like this app otherwise."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've always wanted to keep a journal, and Journey makes it fun and easy. I 
love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"I'm new, but so far it's really helped me to keep journaling. I've set the 
reminder, but it doesn't make a sound or pop up. If I check other 
notifications, it's there among many others x but it has never successfully 
prompted me to journal. I'd like to set more than 1 daily reminder too."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice. Upgraded to pro to unlock all the features."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app... My only regret is that I should have discovered it 
earlier on!"

"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great interface, Iove that it's searchable. Easy decision to get premium. 
One suggestion: make a auto-list option, so the enter key creates the next 
number automatically (for easy list making)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"""Best app to make a memorable moments "" Need option to save entries in PDF 
format and need some animated emojis"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"We are building a house & I am using this to track the everyday progress.

One question, I have a tablet that I want to install this to as well so I have it on a device I won't break but it's saying its already downloaded. Is there a way to get it on both?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's not only a good app for certain people that like to journal but also 
you can express whatever you've gone through in life"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"An excellent diary app. No lock-in, as you can export easily (if you buy 
Premium). Simple to use, good looking and reliable. I am becoming a more 
regular diarist!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"One of The best apps out now love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Does what it is suppose to do and organizes my art and writing across my

recently gotten a actual diary so I will no longer need this app ."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's simply the best journal I have ever used and much better that 
Calendars with Android and Windows. Now with the new Audio recorder, it's a 
wow!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a great journal app. Seamlessly transition between writing on the 
phone or the computer. Also passcode to keep all of your private entries 
private."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really happy that this wonderful journal is free for the basic version and 
that they keep it that way! Thankful that it has a fingerprint lock, 
ability to sync / save entries to Google drive, has daily reminders to 
journal, allows saving journal entries from other apps, allows putting in 
photos and tags and your location. Keep up the good work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Since I dont earn money yet I have not bought any program in my life before

diary app that I will buy the premium feature asap :)) Amazing work!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I tried this a week ago and didn't instantly like it so I put it aside. 
Spent some time today with it and wow! It takes some time (maybe an hour 
for old folk like me) but it's worth every second. It's also worth 
upgrading to Premium just to get the ""Night"" (dark) theme although there 
are a few extras that come with the upgrade. Well done. Too bad leaving an 
entry about pizza on Google drive will cause a flood of ads for pizza. It's 
Google remember."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a very good personal day to day app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. this app gives you a chance to write your feedbacks of 
that 24 hours that you face . It gives a hope to change your life per day 
with a new hope.....!. Feedback > FANTASTIC!👍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Really great way to get into journaling, especially if you want to record 
your life by means other than words."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"rly useful and a good place for me to vent and keep my thoughts stored"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Marvelous!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Super loved it... I enjoy writing on it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is a good app I only would love it if it was completely free"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is the best journal/diary app so far. Easy to use, simple but nice 
design, no ads (I use the premium app)."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"...“Showcase your favourite entries with family and friends, even the world!”... says the first thing you read when first installing this app. I mean, call me old fashioned but when i was growing up, a diary was a meant to be a memoir of your PRIVATE thoughts and feelings on a particular said date/time. But then again, times have changed.  Me:  ""Dear Journal, still a sad, sad pathetic loser today. But on the bright side, that really, really fat ugly chick from accounting smiled at me today...She totally wants my D... I may just have to give it to her (you know, only if she consented, of course!)"" ... JOURNEY: POST TO FACEBOOK?... Me: ""Pshhh... yeah! Let's just go ahead and tag really ugly fat chick from accounting SARAH SMO*****, my boss and of course, Mom to that, #cubiclelife aaaaaannd....post. And to think-- I used to have to write these super personal and completely inappropriate thoughts down in a fabric binder that even had a cute little lock and key so nobody could ever possibly read them!"" Thanks Diary, Journal!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app! I really love it!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think it's great! I never leave reviews for apps but this app is special. 
It's like a memory bank, and I use it daily to keep track of my daily 
activities. All features are great, definitely get premium. It's nice to 
look back and enjoy the memories. Thanks Journey!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Think it is what I am looking for just trying to get acquainted with it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It was simple unique and with awesome ui I prefer d best app was this to 
store our private memories"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent journal app. Easy to use. Recommend paying one off fee as more 
features. Very Good."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great diary app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"App is great and contains almost all features of 'Day One'. Would have 
loved if Premium version had the free access on PC as well. Right now 
subscription schemes are confusing, and premium buys you very few extra 
features on same android app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's nice, but there are too many restrictions for the free users like us, 
but i advice and recommend you get this app, it's a must have."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"A great little app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good and apt app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is a very good app but one drawback can't upload more than one video 
soo please look after that and pictures uploading are also limited"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Like it. Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I've never been a diaryist, but this app is addictive. I'm not sure why 
writing something strictly for myself should be so satisfying, but it is. 
Also, the best of what I write does tend to be a good starting place for 
work intended for more public places."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It took much tym to me to rate this app from 2 to 5. I Love it bcoz of its 
simplicity"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Easiest journaling app I've used. Most important, it's a 
cross platform app so I can use.it on my phone, tablet and PC. Thanks for 
the awesome app!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this it's over simple to use"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best thing about Journey is it supports my clibboard.would be better if 
it starts putting numbering and bullets"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Very useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one.. but i enabled microphone to record audio mp3 and attach it, but, 
i cannot see any option to attach the audio, how can i do that..where is 
the option to attach the audio..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far so good. Easy to use, free version syncs to multiple devices. One 
draw back is that ""motion detection"" cannot be turned off, it's a feature I 
don't care to use."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Nice.. do you have web version. ?"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journaling app out there! I simply love it! Tried others but nothing 
is as smooth and easy to use! Simple yet full of great features!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is a great app for private notetaking and journaling! I would 
definitely recommend getting the premium version-- it is worth it to use 
night mode, view throwback entries, and take advantage of markdown editing. 
I cannot recommend it enough as a private diary, journal, or anything else 
you would want to use it for."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app is great it keep your pictures and notes together This app is 
worth the cost you can.t beat this just try it you will see i give this app 
a top 10 Excellent"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"So far us filling my needs. Keeping track of plans, thoughts, and progress. 
Its easy to look at and review aspects(workouts, journal, plans) via 
tagging."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app. So useful."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"So i like this app but i wish it had more features like the universal diary 
that allows for dailly noted Andrew different cool stuff. It does basically 
the bare minimum"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I like using it to create a medical event log, just the tap icon, enter 
daily weight, then tap ""done check mark"" its automatically time and date 
stamped. I also use it to track ""did I take that pill this afternoon?"" when 
I took pills or other body events so that when the Dr. Asks, how often do 
you...? now I have data. Great!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good one..."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Everything you will ever need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yeah, this app is love"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It is very good for my needs."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent app.... Superbly designed for Dairy ... Loved it"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Best journalling app I've used since Day One. And since Day One switched to 
a subscription model in order to use multiple devices, I've completely 
switched over to this app. Even bought the iOS version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"So very tired of waiting for dev to advise how I'm to get the version I 
paid for & to respond to my various queries. I have been ignored & I want a 
refund. I got sick of waiting, so went ahead & got DIARO now, the free 
version of which is far superior to Journey's paid app. I did warn you I'd 
leave if u continued to ignore me. I gave you ample chances to respond. You 
replied to my ratings twice, giving the same info even tho I told u the 
first time what u said didn't work. Devs aren't serious about improving 
this app, so don't buy it! Your money doesn't buy much anyway."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The best application indeed!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really nice app good for me to write down stuff I read anytime very user 
friendly😊"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great fun"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I was having a hard time and needed to get my thoughts written down and 
this app did a great job."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Will buy it as soon as I have money."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's a big help with my weight loss journey 😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",3,"Would've loved if I was able to post the pictures across the journal as I 
am writing, not in one location"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good works"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I'm loving this app. It's my go to app where I can put down my thoughts to 
paper where no one can read the entries but me. Awesome app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Helping me to be regular. Though I prefer pen and page."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Yeah, it's a pretty good little journaling app with a number of good 
features"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Exactly what I want! 😀😁😍"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal app, but would like the added extra for safe notes"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's overall really lovely, but what I urgently need is the ability to 
access different folders from your local storage as well as your SD Card 
storage, because I have way too many pictures to scroll all the way to 
attach that picture. Its really exhausting."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great app. But I have only one complaint. Make this available for desktop 
and web. Only Journey cloud is available on those platforms. So you kindly 
do that and get 5*."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Great App! Google location tags can be improved. Hope to see in future 
updates the capability to attach PDF and other files. Cloud service is too 
expensive considering it uses user's google drive."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"The app wouldn't give me premium even though I bought, I tried to reinstall 
and now it won't even install"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"simple to use. No complaints"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love the app!! It helps me save memories effortlessly."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is what ideal perfect journalling and should be like It has exactly 
what I need exactly where I want it to be. convenient and perfect"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"this great app let me watch my life differently and enjoy it more."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good App but need to add title feature on each note"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very thoughtfully designed, smart application awesome for what it sets out 
to do - journalling! If there's one feature that I could add, it would be 
to be able to link the journal entries on the map with a line, so we can 
see the path we take on our journeys."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Why all the ""editor's choice apps"" are usually end up being rubbish. What's 
wrong with people!!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really useful one. A pocket journal which is available at any time"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Really Good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I updated my review to give 5 stars. I actually really liked the app before 
but they made me mad with all the upgrade stuff. I swallowed my pride and 
bought the paid version. I still really like it. I would not have bought it 
but it is so much better than anything else I've found. It's simple, it 
does what it says it does and it works. Can't get better than that! My 
original review is below: I really liked Journey until the last version. 
Now every time I open the app and try to do something I have to fight my 
way past several screens wanting me to upgrade. If they are going to badger 
me to upgrade every time I'm going to delete it and find another app to use 
instead."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",2,"App is nagging me to rate it before I know how good it is. So here is my 
rating. Sorry."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Excellent app. Easy to use and learn"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This apps really help !!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I use this journal for recording my meaningful thoughts. I love it because 
I always have my phone with me so I can capture the thought while it is 
fresh."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"LOVE THIS!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This is useful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"100% nice app for writing daries, if it could insert pics in journals, but 
not inserting it over a journal, then I would appreciate it! :D"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Excellent simple to use that delivers what it promises."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I think this is a great app that allows me to express myself in so many 
different ways I think it is truly wonderful"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It is a good diary app. My only complaint is that entries sometimes take a 
while to sync, even when I sync manually. It can take several hours before 
an entry on my laptop can be seen on my phone, and vice versa."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app simaler to day one but good free service can't wait to try prim 
version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, great User interface, regular app gives enough features. Will 
use more and will see to take premium"

photos and videos. Really it had everything you need!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use. Like the reminder feature."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love it...but can you pls include a to do tab"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"5 stars because even without the premium version is does not have ads! I've 
tried many and all of them have ads, kinda kills the mood. I love 
everything about this app. The UI is neat, love the night mode. Everything 
is well organised. Love this so much that went to purchase the premium! 
Thank you so much for this wonderful app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"It's good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Very useful!"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This one is so far the best journal app."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Just the best 💖"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I can't buy the professional version in the software, please give me a 
solution, thank you."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I love this app I and how easy to use the interface is"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Beautiful, easy to use app that makes writing your journal very convenient. 
A big applause for the creators 👏"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"This is this first review I've ever written for an app, but I feel this one 
definitely deserves it! I love the picture/video upload and the passcode 
(in addition to the other awesome features!). The overall user interface is 
clear and clean! I've recommended it to two of my friends and a colleague. 
The only thing is that I tried to purchase the premium version when it was 
£3.99 but the app store froze and restarted without completing the purchase 
and now it's gone back to full price :-("
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Easy to use, wish you could add more than just 10 photos."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great journal program, easy to use, simple controls...would love the 
ability to highlight in my writing without having to buy the premium 
edition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Fantastic tool for journaling. Like the markdown Command to edit my post 
and the analytic tcols."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Great app, easy to use. Would recommend the premium edition."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's the best digital journal app out there. Simple interface, minimalistic 
design and overall enough features to make you want to write everyday. 
Infact I'm so happy that I'm thinking of upgrading to Premium version."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Oke sip"
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"It's a great app. However, occasionally I can't type with Swype which is 
troublesome."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for a quite a while and even bought the premium 
version,its a great app with UI I love. I also liked the cloud feature 
available that allows you type from other devices it's mostly beneficial 
for me when I use a laptop to speed up my typing. I was even going to buy 
it for desktop but it seems it's a subscription model which I can't really 
try for some reasons Great app though, definitely recommend it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"This app really keeps my journey updated. 😉 Very useful, simple and neat."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",5,"Love it."
"Journey: Diary, Journal","Unknown",4,"Good enough"
