There's a limit to ads. Do we work or see ads? This is why small competitors disappear. Greed. Ticker tape ads are acceptable. Full page, non skippable 30 seconds ads are not. People will stop using these kind of apps, you will have to close shop. And you will be responsible for your own shut down. And we wonder why are there no alternatives to Microsoft office?"

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",3,"Polaris is a great program but the free version has been nerfed now that pdf editing is paywalled. Still cheaper than microsoft office, I would consider buying it if I could spare the coin. However in the meantime, the free version is useless to me, and the ads are aggressive, time consuming, unskippable and honestly relentless. Seems to take about two or three minutes of your time if an ad pops up. Supposedly you get one. Aday but it's one every time you open the program."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"SLOW + Adware It barely functions and only after playing an ad for every document. It's not just hiding premium features behind a paywall but just basic functionality. Why the hell would I pay for an app that hasn't proved it can't do the most basic of edits in a mediocre time. Make no mistake. I have a flagship phone. It's just a poorly written app."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Used this Polaris app for a long time had to delete it after the ads came into it long loading times as everytime you open the app to view somthing you have to wait for an ad before you can view the item Am sorry but unless the devs remove the ads I can't use it what a way to loose customers"

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",5,"If I'm to choose, I'll always choose POLARIS. That's because you guys act on reviews and that's a plus for you. So here's another suggestion. It'd be better if users were able to access the printing page even though not connected to a printer. This is a very useful feature for us. But for now, it is not available. For those of us who can't afford the premium subscription, it'll enable us to save our work in PDF format before printing. This'll give you an edge. Pls Input this in your next update"

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",4,"Subscribing to Pro. Generally it works well enough. However it's becoming a bug that often it will hang trying to open when offline as it can't download the ad I thought I had paid not to see, for the AI which I don't want and which isn't available yet anyway. If I'm somewhere I can't use the Internet (some secure servers room for example) it's extremely unhelpful. If the app works properly again I will continue to pay.

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Had it for a while & it worked okay even with incessant annoying ads. That being said, it suddenly doesn't work.

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",5,"What happened to the search function that used to be available on andriod? Updated: i appreciate Polaris quick response to assist"
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"The ads were way too disruptive, making this app useless. It starts with opening to full page ads that I had to wait while it completed the ad (no way to close it), which would then automatically start downloading apps I didn't want unless I quickly clicked cancel during the process! Then, once I was finally able to view my document, banner ads covered up parts of it, and there was no way to scroll to see what was under the banner ad. Using this app was a terrible experience."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Used Polaris for 2 yrs but the ads and nags became more annoying and more frequent. The one that made me finally uninstall says ""Click to see what's most relevant in this document"". How stupid! The nag can only be paused for the day then it's back again tomorrow. Every day you gotta click to kill this piece of idiocy. What total utter Polaris moron thought this was a good idea? Well, they just lost Polaris a paying customer."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",2,"I understand ads, & dont have a problem with them. When you hit the X though &, it takes you to the play store anyway. That's just wrong. To all the businesses that pay to advertise this way,unless the problem is corrected, you will guarantee YOU get remembered as shady & deceptive. When someone taps the X, close the window. You're giving your advertisers False Clicks & everyone a bad rep. If its not fixed immediately it could be considered fraud to the advertiser.. Fix the (X close) button."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",2,"The app itself is good, and I appreciate the need for ads to support a free app, however they are too long and frequent. When i first start the app fair enough to have an ad, but if I switch back and forth between apps I get hit with more 30s adverts. For example, at an airport with a pdf open, i switch to email to check something theb have to wait 30s to get my pdf back. Maybe limit the ads to once every hour or something? The adfree price is too high given there are free alternatives."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",5,"It is good and easy to use"
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",2,"Not without its functionability, this app can be very annoying when one is just trying to achieve the simplest of tasks. For example, if you haven't updated to the latest version all the time (and the app finds out there is an update) the app won't start. So I know it's difficult to believe, but once and a while people don't have access to the internet. I just want to write a letter sometimes you know? Why the constant and hefty updates? I much prefer Word and Excel circa 1998."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Yeah, update fixed a lot of issues, especially the one where there weren't many ads before, but now ya fixed it so the ads have made me uninstall your app. Good one developers. Fools."

Moreover, if I use Hindi fonts, the process of editing gets too painful very early.

You can get rid of them if you pay their one time fee for just one device (does not include promotional ads of their own product). That's not the worst honestly they want you to pay a subscription to remove ads from all devices. So it is a charge by device or accept the subscription in which they place features that should probably come on the application.

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",2,"It's a good app for making/writing word & other documents, but the amount of ads & frequency completely diminishes its use. I'd gladly buy the app (it's not terrible). However, it's subscription based about 60 dollars yearly. If it were not for that fact I would rate this higher. The publisher has essentially designed this app to harass you with ads (which slows down the app functionally & memory wise on the tablet) to try & push the user to buy the subscription, so no good in my book."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",4,"Great app so far. Have transferred from Office Suite and tried out different apps; gotta say this one beats almost all of them. It doesn't take too much space, it has options to Find and Go to a page, easy flow of reading and nice UI. I have just 1 complaint - it does not offer me an option to select a word in PDF format. The file is password protected for editing, maybe this affects it, however other apps let me to at least select. If there's a Web search option too, that would a plus! Tnx!"

It is a master piece for document formating and reading. Thanks for giving the ad version of this great app free. Years after daily and constant use, It is still the best and last bus stop of all word-apps. But I noticed now with new upgrades that when the font - colour icon is activated It takes too long a time to apply. why?"
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed in the recent forced shift to All Access permissions requirement. Now several years of files are lost, unable to be viewed without allowing this app to access, change, and delete any and all files with NO notice on my devices. I know the standard response from the developers is mostly a polite ""too bad, that's just how it is now due to Android OS 11"", but this is terrible. Added to the frustratingly glitchy text input on bluetooth keyboards, I will be looking elsewhere."

Also when I'm typing the words they will all of a sudden cut off other words so I have to end up undoing stuff which can seriously sucks as well.

The app makes changes by itself (adds spacing, deletes words/sentences, etc.) and this is extremely irksome. Best way around it is doing this."

PDF document reading would be better if you can reopen the PDF in the page you left, different modes of reading also will be welcome like ""mobile view"" to read e-books with little letters, a night reading mode will also be useful. Word processor and spreadsheets looks OK, the options are just what you usually expect to find. Tho video clip ads after closing the document tend to become very annoying and intrusive. For some reason, I could never save a word processor document, no matter if I tried on internal storage or external SD card, I always received message ""saving file failed (0)"""

Literally every minute or two, a notice would say recovering document with directions on how to not lose your data. I would get back to work, repeat the above. Then, I realized any edits you made were not saved when you opened the ""recovery document "". It also gave me difficulty in validating my email. Aweful App. Don't waste your time."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",3,"Clunky, particularly in association with Dropbox. After opening a file in Dropbox and working on it, Polaris will not save the file under its original name, but reports that the File/Folder already exists. This forces me to change the name every time I want to save it. Using Ctrl-S on a keyboard sometimes opens up a dialog instead of just saving. The app pushes its own cloud service as the default save location. The ads are implemented in a very intrusive manner. Pro subscription overpriced."

I found this to be a suitable alternative that has last me for several years. Recently, Polaris jammed this with advertisements which I can't stand. I also saw the same on my laptop, but more disturbingly, when I got the executable, legit distribution site, it infected my system with virus. Advertisements can be a vehicle for malware no just an annoyance to productivity. I'm done with Polaris. They spun off of OpenOffice I promise, but they've gone downhill from there. Keep away!"

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",5,"Review after a month of use. Still amazing, much better than official online-only MS Office, and faster and lighter than WPS. Works perfectly for Chromebook. There is just ONE thing that I can live with, but would love to change and is the option to select as touch mode or as pointer mode in Word and Spreadsheets. When you have long-typed files, and you have to select a part of it, there is no way with the pointer to do it. You have to select something they drag the markers. That is totally doable, but it's frustrating when you have a mouse (I'm using Pixelbook). Is it possible to add pointer/mouse support?"

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"The ui is very small, confusing and flashy for new users. Sign into to Google for using Polaris..okay. I click add cloud account after and then Google drive. One would assume you'd either put in a password or click next since youre logged into Google. Nope, Polaris wants you to create a new Google account for it to use cloud services. Why do you have to sign into google on this in the first place. A lot of the menus and placing of options is just silly I spent a few more seconds gradually getting more annoyed trying to find stuff in the menu like adding a Google drive since the obvious didn't work, and uninstalled once another ad blocked the entire screen."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"The ads were invasive and unbearable; impossible to get any work done uninterrupted. Perhaps the quality of this app necessitates such intrusive ads in the free version, but for basic word processing there are other free options out there with much more palatable ad experiences."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled this app and inslalled a different one, but this app still appears everytime I try to open a pdf file, BLOCKING my file from being opened..How can this be possible?"

It was frustrating. Now no hard feelings, but that was just my experience. It's cool that you can just make an essay on your phone without the use of laptops but the bugs just spoiled the bunch.

No. Im not gonna sponsor every single app on all my devices. Be the difference and stop annoying customers. After response: thanks for your automated response with ZERO respect. Uninstalled. Good luck with your ads."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Forces you to set up an account before you can use it and won't accept my usual go-to passwords for nonsense such as this.

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"I am GLAD I did not pay money into this app. Using a spreadsheet has never been more inaccurate. I try to enter information into a field and it magically disappears. Not every time. From time to time, my information may register and stay in the field. Other times, the information I plug in will disappear after hitting enter. I'm trying to make a spreadsheet for work and this app is working against me. At first I thought it was my Note 4 acting up because of age. I found out I was wrong, so I went out and bought a new phone and I'm still having the same issues. I also HATE how ads are taking over the app now. It wasn't this way for a good amount of time."

hangs up the program and is absolutely obnoxious the amount of them. You 
try using it on some random persons phone that download the free version 
and see it for yourself! Then maybe you'd get it! You can't click on half 
of anything without having to clear another ad let alone close it without 
clearing the app through your app clear button. Ridiculous."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",3,"*TRIED THE TOP 5 DOCUMENT APPS, including this, AND FOUND THESE OUT* PRO(S): It has a beautiful and a user-friendly design. CON(S): Compared to the other 4 apps, it uses the MOST SPACE in my phone's storage, which badly affects the speed of my phone. Though I understand that the app needs the space to function in a better way. But of course, I believe that this part can still be improved. Also, to convert a file into a .pdf file, you need a PRETTY HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY, unlike some of its similar apps, which offer this feature without the need of money. Nevertheless, I can say that it's a pretty good app so thank you devs and I hope you'll still improve this app. :)"

changes Media Volume thanks to your ridiculous ads! The ads are too 
numerous & too aggressive! Too many are shown, & are violently loud at 
random times, or lower the volume to zero even after your program is 
closed! Ads helped this great program to stay free, but they used to happen 
in moderate amounts. Unfortunately now, with so many ads, and such 
obnoxious ones, it makes this otherwise great program no longer worth it!"

app but my patience work it out because I almost gave each time I tried to 
do office work or something through the app and I couldn't get through but 
I was very patience with the app usage and I also believed there are menus 
that may be hidden in the app icon menus thus, I searched them and I found 
out there are more better menus that I can use to do my office work than 
some other office app on the ansroid market. I gave this app 5* not because 
of sentiments or allow effect but I am being objective on my review of this 
particular app. Thanks to the developers of this particular app for the use 
of the world and in particular to ease the use of our android phones to 
deliver our reporting and develop documents for the use of any 
organisational responsibilities through Polaris office app. I wish you guys

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"App does not save column widths of existing spreadsheets. I have a document 
that has its columns reduced to 10px squares and merges them together for 
layout purposes. When I edit the data and save the sheet, then close and 
reopen it (anywhere, eg Excel on my desktop), I find that Polaris discarded 
the column widths when it saved the sheet, making the sheet virtually

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",2,"Glitchy and extremely slow. It kept reinserting words I had already deleted 
at random points in my typing stream. Made the app entirely unusable. 
Granted, I am running it on an Android 4.4.2 tablet, quite an old device, 
but that's no excuse for performance this poor. It disappointed me too, 
because the app seemed like a perfect fit for this limited platform. I 
really like the interface and support for saving locally to an SD card. For 
these reasons I will consider using this app more if these compatibility 
problems are resolved."

to keep using it. I will be deleting it off my computer and tablet."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"They shouldn't try forcing us to ""upgrade"" to the app that needs to be 
purchased when they already promote countless ads. I used to really like 
this app before they got money hungry. They won't allow exporting to pdf 
anymore and won't grandfather the previous versions you had on previous 
phones. I'm starting to look for another app to replace this one. I've lost 
hope with this app and their shady new ways. Unless they help us recover 
our previously installed versions we had on our previous phones I won't go 
back to this. I've used this for years without any issues untill my last 2 
phones. I was forced to use New versions that started limiting its 
usefulness. Addendum: the following reply confirms my review. vvv"

this app to need any info at all to work correctly. BEWARE!!!!"
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",4,"Mostly good. Frustrated by trying to email the document (not the link) from

very irritating these days. There are ads popping every few minutes and you 
can't even exit the application peacefully."
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",5,"Very easy and compact to handle"
"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Its a decent app, but the constant waiting through ads make it completely 
unusable. It was advertised to me as a free office app, but every single 
time I tried to save a document I had to wait through a 30sec ad, which 
made using it impossible. And the monthly subscription fee is comparable to 
MS office, so why not just get the real thing? If you are looking for a 
free office app DO NOT waste your valuable time trying this out, it will 
just frustrate you with endless forced ads every time you click a button. 
If you want a pro and fully paid ap, MS office is miles better than this 
anyway. Either be a usable free app with a few tolerable ads, or be a 
full-on pro app with a fair price. This is neither."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",3,"As with all other apps out there, I can't save a PDF as a Word document. Every developer wants to tie users in a monthly or yearly subscription to use the upper level functions of the app. The problem with that is that I might have one or two files to convert per year, so to me it's not worth the money to buy a subscription to this service. I am disappointed."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Have loved it in the past, but the ads are unmanageable now. Some ads are 
of course inevitable for the revenue model. But this now opens up a new

Whilst the Presentation app (slide) and Spreadsheet (sheet) apps are okay, they do lack a bit of functionality  when compared with MS Office.  However, the Word processing app more than holds it own, and with the annual costs half of what Microsoft charge for Office 365,  I'm more than happy with this.   Essentially I now have a great little home setup (Dex Station and Polaris office).  I should also add, that support are really quite responsive."

I applaud Polaris for breaking the stranglehold of Microsoft.  Programs like this are required to get through life these days for students, employees, startup businesses and even the elderly. Obviously those groups have always had trouble paying through the nose to MS.  Now the underprivileged have a slight advantage.  It works great what more can you say."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, but then they decided to start displaying ads. Any time you want to open a document you have to see an ad that appears in your list of documents, then a pop-up ad after you click on your file, and then a full 30-second game ad when you try to edit the file. While you're editing you get random pop-up ads every minute or so, with occasional video ads. Then, when you're done with the file and try to close it, you have to sit through yet another 30-second ad. Then, to finish with a cherry on top, trying to close the app brings up one last pop-up ad. Their automatic prefabricated reply to this kind of feedback is that we have to understand that they're doing it to improve functionality. No, improving functionality would be REMOVING hindrances like constant ads, not making me sit through another ad every time I breathe or pass gas. Anyways, I'm switching back to Word. Polaris can keep their ""functionality""."

So i only used polaris when internet access was disabled(wifi/data off),  I am unsure, but can only asume the constant interupts were the program trying to continually  connect, cannot be certain though. the clincher was after spending 4hrs on my document it would not save it no matter what i did, kept telling me it wont save until document loaded, the doc was loaded 4hrs ago. i could not save-as either (even though it had done so many times before without any problem). i lost the 4hrs of work - uninstalled, and will never use again.  Use with cation, or better still; dont."

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"Thought the reviews could be over the top re ads, so installed. Well proved wrong. At first no ads so led to a false sense of security then the ads started. Talk about over the top. Can't read spreadsheets as ads appear over them, then a video pops up and it wasn't very pleasant. Looked at the upgrade but at a rip off price of 56 euros per year there is no chance of that. Appreciate it costs money to run and develop but what could be a good app is ruined and I would say by greed."

Secondly, where's the option to backlight your font? I can't find it. I know this version is fairly new; I was using the older v. on my S5 & am not impressed by the new app's lack of functionality in that regard. Pls fix or tell me where these things are located now! Edit: still haven't heard a thing from support abt backlighting fonts. Form letter response from Polaris below. Edit 2 no update, terrible reviews, turning into bloatware real fast.

"Polaris Office: Edit&View, PDF","Unknown",1,"BEWARE OF THIS TIME-WASTING APP! If I could give this zero stars, I would. Not only is it useless, but it actually causes more problems than you had to begin with. Aside from the incredibly annoying ads popping up at the worst times (and I was thinking about purchasing the app but this changed my decision), when I'm editing a Word document, as I'm typing it inserts words that have nothing to do with what I was typing. Not even close. I can't even call it autocomplete in anyway because it's completely different from what I'm typing. As a result, I had to trash the entire document and start over  editing on my computer since after a few seconds of editing in this document I had no idea what was there before I started.
