"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have an issue, and I wrote it for the company and They have ignored my email up until now . by the way , this is a really useful application, and it helps me to write my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"app loading time needs improvement. Overall, still very functional."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A high price for minimal quality and effort. I moved to Notion after years of using Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I like it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App fell off hard. Insanely pricey."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HELP! I wasn't even given an option to pay they are holding my information hostage! I have had the free version of Evernote on Samsung Galaxy phones for several years now and as of today I am unable to access my notes unless I pay for a subscription they sent me an AI response back as well Google Play stated that they cannot do anything about this So this is my recourse they're holding my information hostage without giving me any notification I think that this is unacceptable and inappropriate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, used to pay for premium version also but now, without subscription you're limited to only one device and several other limitations like number of notebooks or pages. Oh and intrusive and countless pop-up beginning you to pay the premium version. Fortunately this pushed me to similar apps that offer more for price value and even on free version. Rip"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great product, but only 4 stars because it is so expensive. Not quite worth the high price, but there is no comparable option on the market today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Trying to find old account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bug1: Recently, ordering of notes became worse: looking into the list of all notes that have a certain tag, I still can choose alphabetical ordering, but it forgets my choice soon and resets to sorting by relevance. Using tags intensively, I am all the time resetting the search order to alphabetical, several dozens of times per day. Bug2: when many notes (>100?) have the same tag and I scroll the alphabetical list of these, their order changes to inverse-relevance mid-scrolliing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been enjoying this beautiful application for long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have lost an old loyal customer, i have changed my review from 5 to 1 stars as this application is going downhill, first they are reduced the number of notes allowed, then number of devices, then they allowed only one device, then somebody decided its a good idea to keep nagging about subscription every time you want to use ur app, tthen one big genius decided to irritate the remaining people by spamming you with ads that tricks you u into pressing the ad,a big lesson how to fail massively"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for years. This month I have canceled the subscription. After canceled, the adds are so many and when it's finished still give click bait to the add. I wish I never start using Evernote. It's very annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Haven't seen an app with more annoying ads and pop ups than Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I am a 15+ year user and was disappointed with where the product was going a few years ago. Loving the work BendingSpoons is putting into the product. I no longer have to think about moving my content out. Great job guys. Keep doing what you are doing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it was great until lately. entering text is the pits. Return automatically doubles spaces so to single space you have to repeatedly tap the space bar. and if you go back and add text to a previous line it tabs the lines after it. like trying to type on a 30 year old typewriter. I'd switch, but I've got too many notes made back when typing was easy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of the essential apps in my phone. Evernote is superb and helps me organize everything (plans, trips, friends, and all you can imagine). The app is awesome and has all the necessary functions for a note-taking and organizing app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too many payments for simples notes, payment are too high for the service they offer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has endless popups asking to upgrade to paid- and it's not always obvious how to clear them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Become unaffordable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have utilized this service for 12 years and have greatly appreciated it. However, I am now disappointed as they have introduced advertisements and are pressuring me to become a paid subscriber."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"always an issue when you need it most"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app at reasonable price. Now it's just overpriced and updates almost every day for some reason. Yes there have been a few improvements but that does not justify a price increase by 4 times since I started using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Search will not work without internet connection even if you have all your data supposedly downloaded to your devices Plus its slow and costly All i need it for is basic text notes synced across multiple devices but the greedy owners make me pay for features i dont even need that bogs down the phone. I will be switching to Simple Notes, which is free and a whole lot faster, or zoho notes which is also free and is also encrpted. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP, YOU WILL REGRET IT SLOW..... SLOOOOOOOW"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a great app tik they decided to charge over $100 for it😂😂😂😂 . I do not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is Evernote mad? the upgrade plan takes over my screen and I can not exit it to use my free service!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"way too expensive and unusable unless you pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Depuis la nouvelle version on ne peut plus voir nos notes offices sans payer je change d'application sur le champ! Evernote était bien jusqu'à cette mise à jour bâtarde pour se faire de l'argent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Mar 25: Still not able to use app and web concurrently! Aug 24: You have to unsync your phone to use the web version (or pay). Idiots. May 24: Worst version yet. Dec 23: They keep pushing to buy a plan. Ads weren't enough, now they've limited the number of notes. Greedy & disappointing. Sep 23: This last update has made it difficult to use. Like the many other dissatisfied users I'm looking up how to revert to the previous app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"SCAM - I used the app for a few years passively taking notes, and now it is holding my notes for ransom, not showing unless I pay a subscription. This should be illegal"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You add in spam daily features with daily journals and goals and you can't turn it off. No response to emails. Just spam. Why change something that was good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Advertisements make it impossible to use. Deleted and went Google keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It once was the only app in its category that I turned to for taking down notes, it now has become redundant. Not only is it slow and bogged down, it is more driven by paying subscriptions than delivering a product worthy of the price it demands."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ad experience has become so horrible. Picture you are trying to access some information or passcodes quickly and you have to go through an ad and play a stupid game and waste about 5mins . It has almost becomes unsable. I have deleted the app and migrated to another one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update causes app to keep crashing due to slowness of sync"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deleting the app after 10+ years. Now unusable and ridiculously expensive too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywall, adds, and glitches. Horrible app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app begging for money, better to use google note app , with same features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is terrible now, sorry. I used to love Evernote but now it's unusable and I can't stand it. Deleting my former 5 star review and deleting the newly reinstalled app after 10 minutes. No, that's not a fair chance, but try it yourself and see. There are free options that are better and the price of this is highway robbery. I'm sad this has gotten so bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm with free plan suppose can have 1 notebook and 50 notes, but I can't add new note whenever notebook only has 17 notes. Terriblery app, keep asking to upgrade the plan with terriblery price. Not recommended for everyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It turned into an absolute bad app! Continuously pushing to buy stuff and now it is even loosing notes. There's literally ONE thing this app needs to do, and it can't even do that anymore. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The way ads are used has made this unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app. Very sleazy billing. Forced to pay for a year's pro level subscription to be allowed to download data from app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Usually I love this app. But lately I can't use it because is says I've reached my limit of the free version. I have 1 notebook, 15 notes in that, and my phone is the only thing linked. And I can figure out how to send an email to customer support to try and get it fixes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"still waiting for all my notes to be downloaded to my device, still rather slow, some searches don't work at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Extremely disappointed. I used this app for years because I greatly enjoyed two aspects: The fact that I could record text as well as audio entries, and the fact that my content could be synced between two devices. However, they have changed it so that you are now only allowed to be logged into ONE device at a time unless you pay them $130/year. And you can't just switch the device back and forth either- because there's a limited number of times per month that you can change it. Very frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrendous experience with ads. Moving on to better apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ok, i understand its a free app initially, but having to watch through and/or exit 3 random video ads before even getting to add the note i needed to markdown in the firstplace, makes this app pointless to me...as i absolutely dont want to forget the reason i ininitially opened the app to mark something down as notes are my lifeline! I used to be an advocate encouraging others to add Evernote to their apps, but now...I'm actively seeking out an alternative notes app....just so disappointing 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally the worst App to take notes for any free user, every 15 secs i get a pop up with some discount with a confirmation page on top of that if I cancel. Idk what they trying to achieve by giving a pop up every 15 secs for buying there premium subscription. Just lemme write a quick note that's it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Liked it before they implemented forcing their users to pay monthly/yearly. Can't access my notes AT ALL as I've ""reached the limit"". Have managed to delete notes but this hasn't changed anything. Cannot exit out of the screen that is forcing me to pay monthly or yearly JUST to access my notes that were made before this change. This app has become unusable unless you pay. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Phenomenal app! It has endless uses. The information you need is always available. Improvements are constantly being made to the system. Love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version doesn't exist anymore. It's ridiculous. I have one device, 1 notebook, 13 notes. And every time I try to create a new note I'm told I have to upgrade. Pretty much I can't even use the app. And it's a note taking app! How much money do you think this is worth?! So I'm just gonna uninstall and use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All Ads. Used to be a great app, but they got greedy and now you can't even use the app properly because the Ads don't let you close out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notifications don't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a good app at one time. Unfortunately, it's been getting steadily worse for years now, seemingly by design. Since the beginning of this decline, they've limited the number of devices allowed to run native applications to just two; increasingly frequently spammed users with nag messages about upgrading to the paid version; and removed previously available features, like the ability to edit attachments in external apps. I've switched to Joplin, which has been a far better experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Installed years ago, free. Now can't use, it keeps wanting me to upgrade and now the notes I made years ago are ever lost. Best to not use a 3rd party to keep your notes, use your own drives, not others who make promises of free for life then make it increasingly difficult to use. Don't bother, very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is how a good quality app turns into a hopeless degenerate app. Fully loaded with intrusive ads. Does not work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like Evernote over the Samsung note for ease of use and accessibility across devices. But recently the ads had put me off"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has become too expensive! It used to be affordable and was great. The greed has overtaken yet another brand. Subscribe just take notes is just stupid. Where does it end? Subscribe to breathe? I just bought a paper notebook and it feels amazing. No fees, everything in one place, no need for electronics, no account management. I had a ton of notes and then one day was told to Subscribe to continue adding notes There was a time when I would recommend this to everyone but now I tell them to run"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened? It's so bad now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"most disgusting app I ever used... it has become impossible to use due to popups, so I tried to at least export my notes (about 150 of them)... after tons of popups it made me unsync my accout and now all my notes are lost in the android version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Filled with Ads. Making it impossible to use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was perfect but now it's grimy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update, limited number of notes is very bad experience for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to login tried for 1 month"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even log in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They won't let me access old notebooks I had in place before the new pricing structure took over. Hundreds of hours of valuable information held hostage unless I PAY to re-access it. WRONG!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"have not used app for more than 30 min however if this is the beginning of my journey with tool..we need to suggest to Google play that we out to customize the rating exponential so🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've explored numerous note-taking applications, including Apple's offerings and other popular choices. However, Evernote's superior features and continuous development make it my preferred option. I've tried alternatives but always return to Evernote, and I plan to continue using it. If you'd like to know why, I encourage you to try it yourself; I believe you'll understand."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HATE this app! Used it for several years. Then, one day, tells me I'm over my limit and blocks me from getting my info. No prior warning, I was over my limit. Won't let me get in to delete any or retrieve and. BAD!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I first got Evernote in 2013. It got progressively better and better over time. Then they got into the ""subscription"" craze everybody else is doing. Suddenly all of my notebooks and notes are limited, because I'm only allowed ONE notebook now. You open the app and you're bombarded with offers and annoying popups to subscribe. Obsidian is better. Deleting this trash app and never looking back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They make it impossible to delete your account!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go-to note app for years, but sadly, I am switching to a different app as the greedy people on it are pushing me away with premium clips on every single feature I use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is not usable anymore for free. Too many restrictions and ads. I can see that even paid members are complaining about constant offers and ""what's new"" interruptions for an app that should be used for a quick access to notes. Looks like the greed has destroyed one more good app :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using paid version for over 20 years. works like a charm every time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad... too much ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has fallen hard. First, the AI features have slowed it down and second, the ads in free tier have made it unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app is now adware & totes enshittified"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"most annoying premium ads ever :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All of my notes have been deleted and then you try to get me to pay for it? Why would I pay when you don't even keep what I had?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I use this app to preach, but it keeps crashing during my talk and starting again, at the top of my document, which is always a LONG SCRILL DOWN, to where I left off. Takes away from impact of the presentation. I am debating downloading something more reliable for oral presentations... too bad too... I really love it otherwise."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice improvements. Justifies the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Home screen is beautifully done, but overall everything is lacking customization in most basic areas: can't manually sort notes and notebooks, can't add icons or covers to differentiate them. Free version limits you to only one device (this includes web version). If it had visual journaling options so we could make moodboards, I could justify the price. But for now it feels like I'd be paying an absurd amount of money just to add a second device. The free Notion version offers me more than this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was free. Now req subscription. But all my old notes are trapped till I pay a subscription, and there is no chance to view old notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible all! They make it forcefully paid without informing and won't let you access your notes later"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lo que me pasó es que ya había alcanzado el límite de sincronizaciones en otro dispositivo, y ya no podía de desincronizar los dispositivos porque aparte había alcanzado el límite de desincronizaciones en un mes. Ahora que veo mi computador y llegué al limite, digo, ni modo pues en el celular y ahora también en la app de mobil me desincroniza automáticamente y ya no puedo sincronizar o desincronizar pero sin embargo me deslogea, es una cosa horrible, restricciones y bugs asquerosos."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Holy moly. WTH is this price increase? Thats not a little bit more. 89 to 169 Youre as bad as my accounting program, making things worse but charging more for the privelage... Increases in price usually means they are financially struggling and leaning more heavily on the remaining users. And this is quite heavy. So this should be alarm bells for everyone. Dont say I didnt warn you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not recommended. They want big money after some use, in some cases over ten years. People who have serious notes and files forced to buy subscription now. This is not for a mom and pop storage solution. Avoid if you value your files and cànnot have access for free. Their business model is a failure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"prices are not worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Whoever is running the app is killing it tbh. 😪"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First it was free and now when I have arranged a lot of my study material on this app, they are charging a huge amount of money. It's literally extortion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now price to even access your old notes. Greed will be your down fall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. It's also very annoying that the app weirdly undos my efforts of correcting my misspellings. And for over a year now, it doesn't even let me log in. Won't let me paste my complicated password, and when I could, it spams me with verification checks. And if I pass those, it won't let me switch apps to check my 2FA. And after following a workaround in Reddit, once I have finally logged in, the app CANNOT LOAD MY NOTES. There is no way in hell I'm going back. The management is incompetent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't have the slightest idea what's going on in this app anymore. It used to be an app for taking notes easily and storing them conveniently. That's gone, now there's a never ending array of popups and offers to buy something. Buy what? A permission to take notes in a note-taking apps? Sorry, I don't even read that stuff, I just skip it. And why would I? I only open it to take notes or access one I've made before. Not any longer though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid for the plan, then locked out when I decided not to renew paid plan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Feb 22 2025: Recent update causes constant crashing on Windows immediately after starting app. Have uninstalled/reinstalled, same. Service is now useless. Have used for many many years, and as a paid user. Been ups and downs but this is by far the worst. Other folks reporting same problem. Looking for alternative services."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely ruined by ridiculous adverts. I will be deleting"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it works very well across platforms."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's going on here?! The app has 2.6 rating, but when I change account with different email it shows me over 4. Over 90% ratings this app receive are 1 start for last years. Stay away from this disgusting app and that company (bending spoon)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Many popups for the subscription and you can only use one device. Bring back the old EverNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm Ever-Done. Went through the pain of learning Evernote and used it for years, but it's been downhill since then. Cancelled my sub when they doubled the price to $130 PER YEAR to justify the ""new features,"" all on a spectrum of useless, trivial, cluttering, or cheaper elsewhere. The interface is a constant fight. It would be just tolerable today if it were free, but it's now the price of a FAMILY license of MS Office Suite--with OneNote! Evernote have lost their Ever-Loving minds. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is only just a note, but it requires me to pay It's unreasonable. That's a greed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash, endless ads asking you to upgrade. Limits on the amount of notes you create. Terrible device sync. I just want a standard notes app and this is bottom of the barrel. -- a 2 year user who just unistalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I really enjoyed the functionality of this app for 9 years. Then they raised their prices to astronomical heights. It made me fearful that if they needed so much money from their users, that maybe they didn't have enough to survive with. So I left and took my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm not an expert organizer nor note taker, so it's entirely possible I am easily thrilled but Evernote does everything I need it to do and showed me a few things that I didn't know I wanted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is Trash now. Need to watch 30s ads before using"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I love Evernote, but the fact that premium has almost doubled this year, coupled with the sketch function still doesn't seem to work for my S9 Ultra means I may have to seriously consider whether to renew in the futuure"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constant ads and they try to make you buy premium at every turn. Just use Notion or Obsidian."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The downfall because of greed is crazy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently switched phone because ny old phone broke and could no longer operate. I couldnt get my old noted back UNLESS I lay for the subscription despite I cant even use my previous phone to begin with. Please do yourself a favor and use your phone's built in note app instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Why is opening a note slow?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth the price if you only need a place for your own notes and basic usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Excellent product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App forces your device screen to rotate even if your device is set to disable screen rotation. Evernote somehow is able to bypass the settings on my phone and it makes typing difficult. Flips my screen to landscape over the smallest of movements, when my device has rotation disabled and on protrait mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"in 2014: Better than OneNote or google keep. (And I wanted both to work so much). Once you have it working for you, you can't stop using it. Edit in 2025: They've destroyed the app. it's been unusable since 2021. I've tried waiting for them to fix it but they've only made it worse. it's buggy, slow, and full of ads and upsells. it reeks of greed and neglect. Goodbye evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Says limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes. I only have 28 notes stored but it wants to charge me 129 dollars to upgrade and won't let me create any new notes. This has gone way downhill recently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be good, but slowly they moved basic features behind a paywall. There are much better open-source and free note taking apps available, which can also sync across devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried to log on but keep being pushed to a pay wall and no way to skip it. No option to remove devices or get access to my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads, ads and more ads. Why do they have to let users suffer through nearly UNSKIPPABLE mobile ads for the free tier?? It used to be so different, this is even worse than them begging for users hundreds of times per minute to pay a subscription fees. Just limit the useful features for the free tier if you're that insistent on customers moving to your paid tiers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled app due to unlimited stupid indian ads and the app is no longer user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Из лучшего стало худшим. Требует смотреть рекламу при каждом входе, адски тормозит. Перехожу на другое приложение после нескольких лет использования еверноут"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. I migrated from this app in 2023. Today I wanted to revisit some of my older notes, I opened the app and what have they done!!! The screen keeps on auto roatating even when it is switched off in my phone. When you open a note, it is so frustating to just read it. Took me 4 attempts to just close the keyboard from popping up. Then after that, a video ad popped up. What? I am so glad I migrated before I had to see this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was good when i started using it but now there's just too many ads and pop ups aking to buy subscription. It has forced me to edit my review from 5 star to 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate the restrictions that have been made"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm so disappointed with Evernote. After just my second device switch, they're demanding a premium subscription to sync less than ten text files! It's outrageous to pay so much each month for such basic use. I'm forced to find a cheaper alternative because Evernote clearly doesn't care about users with minimal needs. Looks like ""Evernote"" will never offer a fair deal for small file usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'll give it this second star cause it still 'works' Other than that it's really sad how this app went from near perfect to barely doing anything. Constant pop ups I ignored for years now The fact that it auto rotates no matter what I ignored for years now The fact that I can't just look at the note sometimes cause it's gonna show me the keyboard randomly I've been ignoring Now the notes open like they've send a camel through the see and you just kill the damn thing and open it again hoping..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Kinda terrible now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I uninstalled and reinstalled my EVERNOTE (premium ) app. Unfortunately, it's now telling me my password is too weak and sent me a reset password link through my email. ... I deleted that email long ago and no longer use it... Now, I can't access my EVERNOTE because of my old email is inaccessible.... what do I do now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"209 dollars a year to make notes 🤣✨ No thank you. Here's a quick solution = Pen & paper!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using Evernote since 2015. Today i'm deleting my account permanently. It was already great and useful 10 years ago but today, it is unusable. If you had left everything the same, I might still be using a premium account. Also it became extremely expensive. I mean it's just a Notes Organizer application. Nothing more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app like 10 years ago to keep some info in a safe easy to access place. Now u can only use it on one device otherwise u have to pay subscription also everytime u open it u will get some popups that u cant even close. This app will make u lose all your info that u save in it. Stay away"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"u dropped support for my phone and forced me to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edited Feb 1, 2025: Downgraded my review from 2 to 1 star. I'd vote zero if I could. I'm migrating all my notes to a different app. Since they've now forced me to watch ads before a ceasing my data - I AM DONE!!! I am not buying your premium, and I no longer want to watch ads for 2 mins before I can make a quick note on my lists. The new owners have wrecked this app with trying to sell me premium. I'm a long time user, but soon a user no more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash, really deserved 0 stars. First you could have unlimited notes, then they set a limit at 50, and because I had more, I was locked out of the app altogether unless I switched to payed subscription. That's just straight up blackmail. All the adds for the pro version were already super obnoxious, but this is next level. They've lifted the ban now, but still, there's a million more problems, copy pasting is completely dysfunctional — THEY DO NOT WANT YOU TO GET OUT AND IT'S DISGUSTING"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's cool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HELLO? I can't even read my notes from ten years ago. The premium message is permanently on the screen. At least let us read our past notes. Seriously I had so much respect for this app and it's all gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems greedy and clunky. Says it is installed on devices where it is not"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"From 5 to 2 Pretty much sucks now. It's laggy. It takes away from fast note taking in so many way. I don't want to think about the app when I'm referencing info, presenting info, brainstorming, etc. But Evernots keeps getting in the way. Horrible changes and constant upgrade prompts. Terrible lower tiers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was not aware there was no free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ever since Bending Spoons bought the product and put real development effort into it with legit devs, this app has become super easy to use and full of feature 2017 Review: Been a user of the desktop app and site for more than 3 years now. Not a great app in that bullets and general text formatting is very clunky, inconsistent and does not copy/paste to/from app while keeping current format. With all the bells and whistles, I would like to see this very basic functionality work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Way too goddamn expensive. Functional otherwise"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I can't recharge payment for next.. pls help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full with ads to force you to subscribe. If you are not willing to subscribe, don't waste your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has the app changed ownership? As this app is tottaly unusable now. I would be VERY CAREFULL on what information you store in it. Dodgy! 0 stars. Are your notes safe?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Every time I return jubilantly to this app, I wind up yelling at my phone for twenty minutes. The amount of bugs is truly baffling. I cut text to move to another note - it wasn't on my clipboard. Lost. So I copied it. And it still cut it! When scanning docs, because the app is hella-laggy, if you press back again it takes you out of the note and you lose all the scans. Lots of stuff like that that proves this app is not worth the premium. It's a LOT of money for an app that'd stressful to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I just opened it to try, and it asks me to get premium. I even haven't created a single note...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It has gradually become more restrictive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app. I've been with Evernote since the start and I happily paid money for it but latest price increase quantum ($58 to $103) is ridiculous. Cancelled my subscription. Will consider rejoining if they charge a reasonable amount or offer a lite subscription plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is a wonderful app for storing notes.❤️💯"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was once a 5 star app that I used daily for 7 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"On my phone everything takes a long time to load. I like the transcribing. However, the free version only allows usage on one device and has a limit of 50 notes. The restrictive limit on devices is irritating since the whole reason I got it was to sync notes across devices. Evernote won't tell you this for the first couple weeks, but gradually restricts the devices allowed. Impressed with the software; not with the free restrictions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Virtually unusable if you don't opt for the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very bad service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. But not anymore. Because of their greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Have been using this for a long time. It really works like an elephant.. Great memory. Great function. Sometimes though.. it puts photos on top.. instead of in the middle where you want it to be"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is the best note-taking software on any device. In my opinion! The reason I gave it three stars is depending upon what device I'm using and some random unknown circumstances. I'll get the red bar that says I can revert changes, but I can't see any updates that were previously made. It happens all too often and it is very annoying and unproductive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription price doubled for 2025. And, unless you pay, all your notes are held hostage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EverNote? Mas bien EverAd, si quieren un anuncio con cada acción que hagan descargenla. De cualquier otra forma recomiendo Notion, mucho más profesional, con mas potencial, y sin anuncios."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to app. I have opened it up after not using it for a while. Got bombarded with pop ups nudging me towards buying a subscription. EVERYTHING I tried to do resulted in these pop ups. Almost tricking me into purchasing a subscription. Closing an account if you're doing it on your phone is impossible. They send a verification code to your email (which has been verified in the past) and when you go read the code, you're kicked out of the account deletion page and need to start again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The adds is amazing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote app customer service are not allowing me to cancel and apply for refund just few days of subscription of one year. Is not good at all pls I want to cancel. not serving me the purpose"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app and very very helpfull"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"my fav app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not download this! It is absolute garbage. They used to be one of the best apps around for notes with security features but they've become a sell out now. Invasive ads when ever you open up the app, only way to close the ads is by waiting for 10-15 seconds or you have to click the ad or play a game for the X to appear."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"so far this has been very difficult and clunky. I can't do what I'm wanting to do. the tutorial was vague and incomplete and I'm not happy with the software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They will still charge you even after you have canceled your account. These people are theives stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"- This was the perfect app, you need somewhere secure to write down something you would need in a few weeks and for sure you will forget. - A while ago they started pushing with last time offers and unlock unlimited without an exit button. - But now everytime you attempt to write down or register anything an ad pops on the screen and even if you close the ad the app keeps on playing. - Thank you for the previous years of usage.. Im on to a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"hate subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always asking for paid version! So irritating,if I am happy witg free version then what's wrong with you?🙄 Moreover, now a days they have limited the access with multiple devices. Google Keep ia better than this. I can use that both in Android & IOS. If I purchase a note app, why evernote? I cannot even change the font color or cannot even highlight the text. There are many good paid apps if I want to buy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"life changer thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using this app is a nightmare. It incessantly interrupts my work with relentless pop-up ads demanding I upgrade to a paid version. An intrusive message constantly appears, shattering any semblance of user-friendliness. I regret downloading this app—it wastes my time and diminishes productivity. I strongly advise to avoid it if you value a smooth experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cost soon to be $130 per year, not worth it. I probably won't renew. Use OneNote for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Requires account creation. Nope."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Waste of time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app didn't want to open and it seemed to have a bug and when I updated it, only the payment window appeared in front of me and I couldn't see anything and I couldn't skip it. What is all this financial greed that you are showing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notes are no longer syncing on my phone. I've used Evernote for years & I'm considering no longer using Evernote if my notes continue to not sync across devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"delete is to easy I've lost a few things"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's getting to the point where I can't get to my notes from all the pop ups to upgrade. Copied all and deleted app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great application, I have used the app since 2012!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fraud App. Asks you to register to use services. Once you register they dont rovide anything. Dont waste time guys"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote hates you. Constantly changing terms of service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i genuinely hate that the app constantly ask me for a paid plan every time I open the app. great work you lost a user. i won't pay for a notes app when i can basically switch to entirely free apps. i will pack my stuff and leave the app asap. edit: the last time i used the app to get my old notes to switch to another app i realised how slow the app is. even the text notes takes time to open them. and they show a skipable app now (after 5 seconds) every you open the app. worst notes app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Parah kaco, matrealistis banget tiba2 gak bisa dibuka dan harus bayar"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does what it claims, reasonably well, if you pay them a rediculous fee(17.99/ month) It says I have reached my limit, and can't create any new notes, because I am limited to 50 notes, in 1 notebook. I have 11 notes, in 1 notebook, but, I can no longer add anything because I'm at my limit? I understand the devs wanting to make some money, but, this is a rediculous fee for not much function."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is unusable. I had a paid acct for YEARS; they doubled their pricing and since then it's one terrible update after another, all with price hikes. I cancelled my sub as I couldn't justify the cost anymore. The app is 100% unusable without paying. You can't exit out of offers and deals to pay again. They pop up constantly and only disappear when you quit the app. Now they've added advertisements with no ability to turn off the sound. A note app doesn't need SOUND. RIP to a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost my important information"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's wrong with Evernote that keeps removing password protection from the app for android?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be great, i have just uninstalled and migrated to another app, after 10 years. It has become too annoying with the pop up every time i logged in. Probably they got a bit greedy or management had changed. Glad i was able to export my notes before I get locked out unless I pay. 👎🏾"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bloated garbage. I've used this app for 15 years and while it started out as a solid note keeping app, over the years it's gotten bogged down useless garbage. Every time I open the app to read a note I have to click 5 tiny little buttons to decline ""offers"" and whatever else. Completely ruins the utility of the application. I don't know how I didn't uninstall years ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was FREE for YEARS... Out of no where now they want a subscription FEE for the SAME exact features that was once FREE... Won't even offer a free trial or any way to retrieve any work. Zero stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My Go to for All My Notes, Reminders, Tasks and Lists"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good, but has become unstable. I was a free user, decided I should buy, started the 'free trial', but now it gets stuck asking me to try the free trial, and I can't access any of my notes. It's NOT worth this headache, so going back to Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New UI design is terrible for editing text and tables. Limiting sync'd device to just 1 now for free account makes this app even harder to edit text."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"On Desktop it works amazingly, sadly on Mobile the experience couldn't be worse, the most annoying part for me is that I made most of my notes based on outside links, and they simply wont work, I tried pressing right into them, holding and manually pressing the open link option, simply nothing works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't get to my notes, something must be wrong with the app. This needs immediate attention."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use the Samsung Note or similar apps for free. This app locked me out of information I had stored for a couple years. They will not let me retrieve anything and ask if a sudden charge you to get access to things you had in the app before they started charging. Ugh! I hate this company. Don't trust them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Usually good with some technical glitches with copy and paste. I have emailed about this without a response. When I try to copy, it cuts and then doesn't paste. This keeps happening. Yes, I have installed all updates. And no, this isn't a general issue with my device because it only happens with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not so good anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was the best note taking app by far, now is annoying, expensive and almost unusable in the free version due to constant sales push and ads. This is a perfect example of how to ruin a good project."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I’ve paid for many years, yet it’s even more sluggish now. Evernote should hire fewer people, rent less office space, and invest in more cloud servers and bandwidth. Otherwise, everyone will lose their jobs. I really hate the 'What’s New' pop-up. App syncing is always delayed, and sometimes, just opening the web page is a struggle. The team keeps adding useless features like a to-do list and calendar widget, making the app unstable. Just focus on the basic note-taking features!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app.They went from allowing to use two free devices to one free device and now full of ads. Terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years to keep notes and tolerated their annoying pop ups every now and then asking me to try the paid version. Then one day all of a sudden, I find myself locked out of my existing notes and unable to access them because now I HAVE to pay and subscribe in order to be able to use this app. Awful trash, stick to MS OneNote instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is getting worst day by day. The advertisement popups each second. Can not view the previous contents. Today is a height unless i recharge, the advertisement popup doesn't allow me to veiw my contents."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before it was good. But now Iam not able to login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"terrible after they have added the publicity! you can't stop and get out it's such a waste of time. too sad to let go of this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have less than 100 notes on my account and it keeps talking me I've reached the limit of 100 notes. Since today's update it won't let me open any of my notes unless I pay to upgrade. I can't afford to upgrade and all my important notes are on there I need urgent access to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"memories don't vanish like tears in the spacetime continuum"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot log into my old account. It had over 600notes written over the span of 3 years. I shouldn't have used to app to begin with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Under new management, the semi-free version of Evernote has ads and requests to join the paid side, and when you decline, it asks ""Are you sure?"" And it pops up the next time you use it. I'm STILL sure. I would leave except I have 10 yrs of notes saved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was Great until they got greedy. Now they want you to pay for the Search option? I will gladly pay for an app but I hate subscriptions. I only use it for old notes and I won't make new ones on this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote looks great and has potential, but it utterly sucks. The keyboard constantly glitches, requiring multiple taps to format text. Features randomly break, sometimes showing a black screen on your features. Copying text is a nightmare, you often have to strip formatting just to copy it. The app is slow, glitchy, and frustrating, especially after hours of work. This is by far the most annoying app I’ve ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A Must have application for smart phones as well as destops... reduced my rating to -10000"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I actually don't mind any popups reminding me to subscribe. But putting up long ads right after opening each note to force someone to subscribe is just annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They make it hard to export notes if you did that a while back. Seems like it's forcing me to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"incessat popups to subscribe make it unusable, but it also is slow and laggy while being extremely poorly organized in terms of UI. The idea that this experience would make me consider paying is laughable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant forced attempts to manipulate users into a paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Long time user. Disappointed Since they introduced price tiers, the free tier will not let me create more notes, even though I am under the limit. and every action has the upgrade pop up, sometimes multiple times. This app WAS awesome. Now it's just a nightmare."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was useful for a while but then was locked out once the free limits were hit. Forced to pay one months subscription to retrieve important notes. After that I cancelled and deactivated the account. Since then I have been charged the subscription fee two more times. The only way to stop it, according to their site is to log in, etc. But since I deactivated the account it won't allow that. The company has no phone customer service and has made it impossible to stop being charged. AVOID THIS APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash tier app now. Used to be the best notes app. Now you can't open the app without being bombarded by advertisements trying to upsell you on upgrading. If it was a one time thing, or maybe once a year when they had a promotion going on, it wouldn't be as annoying, but it happens every single time you open the app. NO I DON'T WANT TO UPGRADE RIGHT NOW, JUST LET ME ACCESS MY NOTES."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free plan is now unacceptable, with far too many restrictions. I'm switching to something better. The way they beg for money is disgraceful—just lock the free version entirely if that's their approach."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Normally i would give 0 but there is no 0"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying as hell with a pop up to subscribe on every damn click you do can't even properly go trough your old content and clean up because of these pushy pop pups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"excellent but ca be slow ...surprising power!! would get a 5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was the best note taking app once upon a time. Now toy need to get through a bunch of popups just to jo something down. Oh, and now... Ads. Great. Will replace it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I gave it a chance, I truly did, but something that's been in this industry from years still cannot build basic things and the new comers like capacities surpass them in every aspect, going above and beyond in features and UI is just frustrating at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ads have killed this app. Google keep is my primary note taking app now. Sad to see how a good product got killed by these useless obscene ads which hold you hostage for whole 1 to 3 minutes when you open the app. Developers please take these reviews seriously and show it to your bosses!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ok if you can get through the relentless ads I've been using for years and has been great. However, now it's getting replaced by OneNote. Constant ads to upgrade or sell products. MUST have internet access now. No offline access anymore. Ads are so invasive, I can't even get to notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier it was a better app.Now it keeps on loading in my tablet..very sad..i liked the app so much and now i dont want it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for nearly 10 years, all through highschool & middle school, now it's trash. used to be amazing, loved having so much room to organize & other features, now you get no features. you get no new notes, I have always been able to add new notes, now you have to pay to have more than a ""set amount"" I'm not even sure how much the amount is but it sure doesn't seem like much. also throws pop ups in your face to buy the paid version every time you tap anything. every. single. time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I don't want to leave Evernote, but the app is very slow compared to Zoho Notebook and other competitors. It's very irritating to wait 3–5 seconds to view a note. I set my screen to turn off automatically after 2 minutes of inactivity, but while using Evernote, the screen doesn't turn off automatically even after hours. Evernote keeps rotating even when my phone's auto-rotation is turned off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update : 02-04-2025 : I pay $70+/yr for thus service & was ok up until whatever changes were made recently. Since then can't access most of my notes OTG. Has caused me problems with clients & appointments alike. 08-17-2023 : I'm getting more and more disappointed with Evernote. I've been a subscriber for many years, but with data losses, frequent file inaccessibility, poor customer service and ever increasing prices, this will probably be my last year of paying the nearly $70 annual fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing, now it's just frustrating. This app had it all—until it didn’t"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"4.7—A damn near-perfect app. I appreciate the work that the devs put into it. When they post update videos via YouTube, I'm impressed at how attentive they are to user feedback. That said, it could use more organizational options such as the ability to change note titles en masse. Also, I would like an exclusion option when searching for notes (via tags). But most importantly, I'm concerned about offline accessibility. I would like some way to store my notes locally via my own storage devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I wish it had a save button so that I know that whatever modifications I made to a note or definitely saved. makes me nervous just putting something in as sometimes what I modify is not saved. having a safe button is more intuitive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Way too expensive!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"paid to use evernote for 10+ years, it's a shame that the sketch feature is not working on Android phone. got this problem for years and it's not fixed yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"4 ad pop-ups to quickly view one of my notes. This app is turning into a trash app. Complete pain to use. Moved on to google keep. Dont waste your time with this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I canceled my subscription last yr and got charged this year for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for many years, used to be great for taking notes, then they screwed up and decided to add ads in, unless you pay. Waste of money to pay for an app just to take notes. App has now been deleted and notes shifted elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Would be great if I could log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Wonderful app. I created, fetched many many new users for this but then it became paid. Too costly so i shifted to free MS One Note where i m getting around 65% of Evernote. Miss u Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nightmarish complicated everything very difficult"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user for 10 yrs+. Was a great app, good at its one job. Now its bloated, slow, buggy and far far more expensive than it was. boo. Actively seeking alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the android version is virtually useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Junk!! Nothing but problems using this, it's become a complete waste of time. 2022-02-27 Still junk on 2022-12-17. Now figuring out how ti get my data off their system. 2025 overdue to move what little I can save off this DOG"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"SO MANY POPUPS!! WHY! :( Same as yall, got this app over 10 years ago. It was free, did what it was supposed to, free users could sync up to 2 devices. This app has been a staple in my life. So I'm really disappointed with the amount of pop-ups asking users to pay for the upgrade. I can barely use the app man..I'm fighting off these stupid pop ups left and right and you'd think after declining 15 times in a row there would like a cool down period where they leave you alone before asking again?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really useful but ads available annoying and can not be skipped or closed. Cant reach my notes as they want to force uou to make a subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Mouse cursor scrolling does not work when on a single note on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra. Please fix it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Am I crazy? I can't find a way to log out! I've hit every useless button and prompt. I can't fbd how to logout! Awesome, hopefully I'll lose my phone and whoever finds it has my passwords and other shiz! Please help someone!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much pressure to upgrade from free, annoyances made me uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but these ads are annoying as hell and take me to my YouTube to see some indian weird videos . Don't waste your time downloading this garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reduced performance and keep showing ads and purchase offers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went from goat to trash over the last few years. Before you could use at least two devices for free and have more journals and notes. Now every update they try to nickel and dime you .... look elsewhere there are better free apps with more and better free options. Also Everytime you open the app you get hit for the premium upgrade that is invasive af. Will be uninstalling and getting a better app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Login doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"do not SUBSCRIBE!!! last year I canceled my subscription, they still charged and wouldn't refund. I tried using Evernote again, paid the annual fee and decided the same day of paying the annual fee, not to use and tried to cancel my payment. Do not use!!! they do not respond!!! NO NO NO!!! I used it for years, and was pretty happy until they charged me the professional level last year and wouldn't respond to request to change to personal or cancel. switch and bait.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It used to be my go to note app, but not anymore! All that's important to them now is your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free account is not usable anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wish I could have an easy emoji icon ♦️♣️♠️❤️ on Android. As a Cartomancer, these symbols are critical .. Also copy paste function doesn't work at all from Evernote to What'sApp on Android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many pop up about what's new, sync your device and asking for annual subscription to their service. It creates nuisance while typing any note or reading some important note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Because of pop-ups, annoying adds and never ending plan promotions. Its beyond annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks. Problem solved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The went from great years ago to disaster now. You'll dismiss an unreasonable amount of popups before you can get to your notes. Not recommended at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"With this hike in price, a disappointment. I am too often challenged with dysfunctional syncing. Frustrating."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rip off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use evernote back when I was in college and decided to redownload it again. Way too many things are restricted now that makes the free version unusable. Why is it that I can't sync two devices at once. Completely unacceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Member since Aug 2012 1/31/25 new review, Stars up by 1. Based on the frequent updates being done. I still have issues & the constant updates are either not relevant TP me or just confuse me. For few years, looking on how to change/edit line spacing on simple note or do. How or where can I do that? ----stripped most old reviews-- No ✴️'s. Beyond words how much I HATE you people at Evernote. Last week, 3 days of hours lost b/c of Evernote ruining notes, all were simple text, copy & paste."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Intrusive ads, not as good as before"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate how when you open this app, it's one or the other screens that pop up and block my way to my notes. Even annoying is that most of these popups ask for a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware! This Company WILL Screw You Over! I loved Evernote until they Closed my access six weeks before my renewal date, refusing my regular password, then upped my subscription from $69.95 to $169.95. No matter how many times I tried with my regular password or new passwords they seem to have approved the app still would.Not Let Me Access my documents for 13 months - until they wanted their big payment again this month. There is No Way to Email or Call Them even from their pages. CROOKED!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app until they started charging, what used to be free. Too many other apps way cheaper or free. No thanks, I'll stick to Microsoft365"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good ui"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app has in recent days become a pain in the b... Only opens games ads each time u open, without being able to use the Evernote. Pathetic is not the word in recent times. Time to look for other options of app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Irritating ads and slow app. Too much pushy for premium subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since Bending Spoons took over, this app and website have been infuriatingly slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrific user experience! Bombarded with Ads and Offers from literally the first moment of usage. I made a video of the experiments if you're interested devs (reach out to me)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Oh my god! This new interface isn't even letting me access my old notes in peace without constant interruptions and literal ads! Why is anybody paying for this i don't understand, in light of much better free alternatives like Notion or Samsung Notes! This is simply blackmailing me, not even letting me access my own old notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Going DOWNhill; S22 Ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily expensive note taking app. Three are many free note taking app out there to do the job."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Tem melhorado..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I like the app, but now the annual price is tripling, very hard to justify."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great Note app. I've been on this platform for many years and I am happy with it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sadly this great app is now a money grab. Been with them for nearly a decade. After a while i get pop ups asking for money and now i cant see my notes without paying. Evernote is now a money grab, I'll be uninstalling you guys"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads added 🤒😵‍💫😤"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the free version of this app for years and as many others have mentioned with the new reduction of what's in the free version I find myself looking for a new app to house my notes. The subscription costs are high Edit: Lowered my rating, I currently only have 2 notes in 1 notebook and I am told that I have reached the max of 1 notebook and 50 notes (which isn't true). I am unable to make a new note without upgrading to a paid subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote needs an actual human to help their customers. Brutal. No phone number to contact anyone for help. Frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for a lot of storing and organized information. price could be a bit better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"a valuable tool in personal and business life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 star trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As most of apps searching for cash and after уеаrs of using now files without approach... Zero will be appropriate..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"use to be great, i use this app since i can sync it to my phone and laptop, now i cant even do that? really disappointed. guess i just go to a much more worthy app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this app is amazing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Beware - they have very little customer service. So when you have an issue with the app, only bots are available to help. Really frustrating, given the high price. I am switching to One Note soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be a great app, not anymore, free version doesnt open on 2 devices as it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many additional payments, can not log to my account to delete account even"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The limitations without upgrading are too much. Also the amount of pop upside to 'upgrade' are painful. Uninstaller app after 5 mins of usage. Sorry Evernote, you used to be awesome."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"sketch doesn't work when trying to write."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Download for free, but later need using tactic for you to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Using since 2011, I loved Evernote sync on Apple, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone, they should give special offer for legacy users ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be clean and sleek. These days the layout is garbage and I don't know what paid use is like these days, but a free user is endlessly bombarded with prompts to try get you to sign up. The kind of prompts that aren't simple to get past. Straight up horrible to use these days. Use to be 5 stars...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Inaccessible without subscription. Can't even try it out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Janky service and app. I used the record and transcription service on the website. When I went to look over the transcript it gave me two options: pay $1.99 or sign up and get for free. After creating account and downloading app it told me it's would $5.99 a week with no free options? I now have lost the hour long recording from the meeting and probably will never hear from it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fantastic 😍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to read a note is a test of patience. Had to go through 3 pop up screens before i can actually reach my notes to read it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"More and more expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads in Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great way to keep records. easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime I try to login they ask me to pay, very hard to find the opt out. Now despite having only 10 notes it tells me I can't make any more under my current plan (says I should have 50). App went from great to unusable over the years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App unresponsive when I need to edit notes. The toolbar doesn't show up or shows only after retrying loads of times. Bring back the ""old"" Evernote. It worked seamlessly! Can't say the same of this travesty with the same name..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way to many ads now. Used to love this app. Now it is trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Original: 5 star review from 2012... Revised: it's clunky and costs $120+/yr no thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Made the mistake of paying for an annual subscription on the web, not through Google pay. I was quoted £3.99 a month on their UI for an annual subscription, which would equate to £47.88 for the year. Instead I was charged £64.99. I contacted support with proof of this offer in £, but they ignored this and kept quoting the US price and would not refund the difference. I am very unhappy and notice on reddit I'm not the only one getting overcharged. This is not ok."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app, it is my favorite. I have had it for many years. It is easy to use, and changes I make can be seen on ALL my devices. I highly recommend anyone to spend the money for it, because it is worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Maybe they changed their UI I hate this ❌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the first app review I have ever left on play store. I am with everybody else on the constant prompts to upgrade. I have to weasel through 3-4 prompts every time I open the app to look at my notes or write something down before I forget it. The close prompt button is intentionally hidden or hard to find. Free version is also severly limited on features now. I'm going to find a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So not deserve 1 star too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good look getting anything accomplished between the adds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome! I so uninstalled the ""Note Pad App"" for this App and I'm enjoying it so far. Searching for a word in any of my notes is a breeze. Awesome App! Mahalo nui loa. 01/26/2025 - I still continue to find this app Awesome. It may have changed a bit but I am still able to work with it and continue to use it. Keep up the Great work!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editing to -00 stars if possible. Have used for years but now they want $86 yr. No way!!! Not worth $10. Used it for many years. I even have the paid version.. Lately the app has been monkeyed with so much it has become very very difficult. I used to be able to open the app and jot a quick note.... a person's name, a movie, paint color... Just something I wanted to remember for a short time. Nope! Stay away!!! They have ruined a great program. Greed is not good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch - beware! I am an original user of Evernote, which was great until they put everything behind payment. I had to delete my 10+ year old notes to get below the ""free limit"", which was not how this app was sold originally. Predatory pop ups all through the app with no way to close asking for payments. I'm now in the process of moving my notes to other software due to these new practices. Look elsewhere for online note taking apps. This one is not worth the constant hassle. Bad Co.!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow to register"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This went from a great notepad app to a terrible app. I use to use it for all categories and lately have tried to remember to back it up every few months because of crashes. The other day I was denied access to the app unless I paid them a monthly fee of almost $18 per month or lose my notes, more than the cost of Photoshop and Lightroom together - are they insane? - for a notepad app?! Microsoft charges about $2/month for outlook. Since I refused to pay, I lost all of my notes. Terrible app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Didn't realize the notes I've been adding for the last month weren't getting saved even though I was sure I was saving them. Lost all my notes, can't find them anywhere on the app. I tried logging out and restarting my phone, didn't get any of notes back. I upgraded my subscription to see if I would get access to the notes because it kept saying I need to subscribe, still nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From the best note taking app to the app where even sign in doesn't work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"became painfully slow with all those extra features after reaching 3000 notes. used to be way better with the old simpler version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My basic access was revoked bc I do not pay. I was forced to unsync my phone without an option to save my notes first. Now I cannot login or recover my them. I regret ever using this useless app!!! 2020 review: Information is not safe!! I have always loved evernote & used it as a diary/planner for 7 years. Today I just learned that a different IP address had accessed my account. Evernote only just started alerting users. No way to contact support unless you have paid membership! Terrible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only use this app to access a small bit on data I put on it years ago. I went to look at it and its now locked behind a paywall. Vile company, I would never recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best Note taking App .. 👌 with the Developers always working to maintain it and introduce new features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is not supported on Chromebook per Evernote (see How to Guides for Evernote) Play Store is still allowing Chromebook App do be downloaded and updates to run on Chromebook. It is not compatible it will not log in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's so easy to use, and it helps me organize my philosophy thoughts, which is not an easy thing for me to do on paper. Not only that, but it's easy to find them later to reorganize and apply my writing to different projects in the future. Highly recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using free version for many years. Over past year, have been using less frequently, as there is continual prompts to upgrade to paid subscription. Then, a week ago, Google Pay puts a yearly charge through my credit card and refused to refund, in spite of fact I did not knowingly subscribe. And Evernote also refused to refund because they said itbwas Google's responsibility. BEWARE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"my only issue is that every log in comes with a new set of updates which slows the process. if they could occur in the background automatically it would be so nice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is not showing my previous note. It says note unavailable....after last update. Very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"prompts to upgrade are overly aggressive. ive been using this app on a single device at a time for a long time and have no need for the upgraded services, especially for what is offered at this price point. will unfortunately be switching note productivity app very soon. also text formatting/correcting issues are atrocious."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version limited to just one device. For free version you spend about 5 minutes repeatedly deny offers to upgrade and pay. TOTAL WASTE OF A GREAT APP. DO NOT INSTALL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app was phenomenal 3 years ago. Recently, not so much. Everytime I open the app, I get overwhelmed with the subscription pop-ups, sometimes I don't even bother to write a new note. I understand that subscriptions are essential, but I really don't want to get annoyed with subscription pop-ups. Other than that, it's a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is buggy and for over a month I can't clip any webpages. Huge waste of time and money. I will not be resubscribing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a good general note taking app until they decided to charge two arms, a leg and your first born child for something that should be free. Greedy bastards these days."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful. First it was the limit on devices and now the ads. What next, I need to shout on the streets ""EVERNOTE IS THE BEST"" to access my notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Things are added very fast which tells me why there is so many extra patches being applied. Slow down a bit and make sure the code is in good shape before releasing it. Otherwise, you have a good product. Don't mess it up!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do NOT get this terrible app! Lost all.my i for notes everything and they are no help at all! Keeps telling me that my email is not associated!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the worst and did not do what it was supposed to do. I originally got it for transcribe from a photo. And then to cancel it was a nightmare and I had to give up information such as my name and location! In order to get to a page that told me a different instruction I had to open in a new tab in order to cancel my subscription before I canceled my account! This is horrible do not download.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you put adds on the app it won't make people spend money with you it will only make people delete the app and find the alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is a good app for writing and syncing notes, lists and other information with many devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since 2013. Have 500+ notes on it. But too many ads without an x out button now make the app practically unusable. Really disappointing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of using it Notes, notebooks, everything is badly messed up. It's unrecognizable when I open the app. None of my notes are there like it was just a few days ago. I don't know what happened, wether my account was hacked or a problem with Evernote. What a mess!. And I have no clue how to get my Notes back, or my Notebooks. What a disappointment, and I am a paying subscriber!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A beautiful little noting app, but broken sketch tool. There's a pricey subscription to pay if you use 50 notes or more. I would pay it, but I'd want the sketch tool to be fixed first - It's been broken for a year, with no announcements on why. That's a bad impression from the team behind this app and future prospects. Sadly, I'm going to another app (Notion, better features and pricing value but no sketch tool), and a dedicated sketch app that can share my sketches to Notion (Huion Note)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent platform to be able to share files with others or even between your own devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not very useful and user frequently"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Don't install this app, it's full of greed and Ads. UNUSABLE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forces you to buy a subscription when you've already had notes long before it even had a subscription and you can't get any of your old notes back that you've put on Evernote. I wish I could give it zero Stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was fraudulently forced to pay $14.99 to access my data on this app. It said I had the choice to disconnect my other devices, but when I choose that option it simply froze and would not proceed. After trying this multiple times, I was forced to pay, as I needed to information to fill out hospital forms. This is a despicable scam."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not a good experience, it doesnt log in any account, gmail or apple"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It would be nice to be able to choose automatically list passwords alphabetically and by date."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tragedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full of ads, slow to load, limited functions in free version - much better free options for note taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"grown to depend on this app with 22k notes over the years and now it is more like a life management dashboard for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sync failed on my phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Suddenly all my images have gone and replaced with a function to translate to text! How do I get my images back? Their hep is useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote since 2019. It worked very well earlier. But now some notes donot open only. Mostly its filled with ads only. Even single user, it shows so much ads and compells user to buy thier packs. Annoying & Disappointing.. Best app turned hopeless. Soon will quit this app and uninstall it.. Notes dont open without data connection, and if data is turned on, ads starta annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"noob"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for many years with no problems. Now it won't open it says I'm over the limit,won't let me open my saved notes unless I pay. How can you make me pay for notes I've saved from before. Complet crooks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Well it has got better recently, so that's an extra star. Still can't create tags when web clipping though. I'll give it a year at the new price and expect some significant improvements or it's curtains for Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reached a whole new low this one. What you get for the subscription is pathetic. Get rid of your upper management and hire some good ones. This band seem to be caring only about their pockets."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have tried numerous times to cancel my paid subscription and return to the free subscription. Evernote will not allow me to do so. When you send an email, you get an automated response, there is no way to talk to someone live to fix this issue. I do not want to pay for another year, but Evernote is making it impossible for me to cancel."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit to ine device linked at a time on the free account... Nonsense, you should remove the free tier if your intention is to force every customer to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for quite a long period of time. Unfortunately, it's getting worse after its major update in those few years. I think they don't understand what the users need for the note-taking app. I want to migrate to other apps, but it will be a tough task. It's the only reason I'm using this app. I don't recommend this app for the new users till Evernote realizes what they should deliver. I really hope Evernote still can remedy the app in the right direction."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It once was the best note-taking app, but now it's ruined by ads and pop-ups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even use the free version to look around without an ""upgrade now"" window popping up. As far as I was able to see it's an organization app that wants you to upgrade to use any feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using for years through college and real life and everything in between keeping notes of essentially most things I need in one nice and organized place offline and online. It's undergone a few major changes over time. Some, very much needed and others maybe not so much. Even so, Evernote has stood the test of time over its counterparts and still is my go-to for anything worth planning, logging or taking note of."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app itself is great - if you get the paid version. I've had the free version for years, I had the paid version for years and have a hard time justifying the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Greedy company ruined it. And made it extremely uneasant to use if you don't want to pay them 150 bucks a year. Skip it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lose my data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"really expensive, put your notes on Word"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until GREED took over. Still is a good app if you are willing to pay the ransom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has been so unuseful for me as i don't get any reminders for the tasks unless i open the app and even when it is in my recents it doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"When I open this app it's because I have something important to me that I want to write down while I'm in the flow. Obstructive ""What's New"" and ""Try this new feature"" pop up screens, sometimes without even any ""not now"" or ""skip"" option, that pop up every time I open the app are an annoying interruption and I'd love them to just stop. I would like to just open the app and quickly easily immediately access my notes with no interruption from the app. And btw paying customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lol prices changes have it unaffordable ......"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app of all time, they force their subscription on you, and you can do nothing, can't access, can't type. I lost all my years of notes because of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent app, keeping the price point more competitive will help with increased subscriptions. there are other similar apps with $50-80 per year subscriptions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth the money...going for another better, yet cheaper app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"UPDATE | I have been a paid subscriber for more than nine years. I primarily use the Notes feature, always including an image, an audio file, or hyperlinks to sources in my notes. However, the Notes feature still has several bugs that detract from the app's usefulness. With the upcoming substantial increase in subscription costs, I am carefully weighing the cost against the value it provides. I will not pay $130.00 a year for this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Phone version works slow and desktop version takes a lot of RAM. Update: They have made this app unusable if you are not willing to pay for it. Now it shows ads every 10 seconds and you cannot do a single task without an ad interrupting. Going to move from Evernote for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did you just highjack my notes? As soon as I open the app i get hit with a pay wall and cant even see my old notes. This app was great haf been using it for years but noe it's pretty much fraud."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow to load notes. Syncing is limited to one device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much adds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app use to be so useful and easy to use. Now its become one of many greedy apps who bombard you with ads, pop ups and now theres a paywall to the amount of a streaming service. I hate this age of subscribtions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware!! This has turned into Ransomeware. Used to be free. Logged into this app after long time and now cannot even access my notes. Asking to pay for subscription. Just give back my notes. What a shady company. Lol also notice some fake positive recent reviews."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent APP. Now I can write down and follow up all my tasks in a very organized manner."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using Evernote for 15 years and I have watched it get fatter and slower over time. This price increase is not only exorbitant, it is insulting. A sure fire failed PR model. I'm out and I will be sure to share why. With time to cool off, I am repenting. While the app is still slower to load than it used to be, is fat with features I find off point like tasks and calendars, I have to admit that $10.58 a month is not an unreasonable price for a robust SAS. Poor public relations."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to write down my notes on this app, but now it's demanding subscription, even I am not able to see my notes. There is no way to contact customer care, pathetic, horrible experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience I can't login to my account (continue with Google) i attempt more time to reactivate my account still not work. Developer kindly please fix this error, easy way to login with any trouble. I really love this application compared to Google keeps and samsung notes. And upgrade new things like sketch to draw with AI image generator unlimited, voice to text, stickey notes, remender, one tap to share files, command prompt to AI pdf generator."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wrote several notes then the app refused to sync, I updated it may be it'll solve the problem, but what happened is most of my important notes has gone and the app gahe ne limits on notes and notebooks. Really good lesson to keep my stuff locally and never rely on any corporate exploitation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my go-to notes app for about 10 years. Over time they've gradually whittled away at what made it great by removing more and more features from the free plan and CONSTANTLY nagging you to upgrade any time you try to do anything. Do they really think anyone is gonna pay $15 a month for a notes app when Google Keep exists? People who used it for years would've had an interest in continuing to do so if they didn't make using the app on the free plan as abrasive as possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote actually became much better after getting sold. I must say, I was apprehensive, at first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to call Evernote my little black book. I stored all my professional & personal information that would go into a safety deposit box. I have over 700 notes. I have also introduced Evernote to my friends. Evernote is my own memory tool. Now Evernote is allowing game pop ups that don't go away and there's no X to delete it. Therefore, you have no access to the note on Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once your free trial period ends you can't even open the app without being forced to a subscription screen. Trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So, I launched the app and I get a pop-up that I reached my limit and I have to subscribe, essentially locking me out of my notes. Brilliant stuff..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Legend says that this Company used to make 5 star apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer useful. Used to love this app it was my number one most used app on all devices that was before the limitations and high asking price. Will find an alternative that's free or create my own."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me retrieve none of my stored information without paying a subscription fee"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am editing my review after 9 years of use. Now evernote is a worst note App for free users. It's like a cheating with old users. You can't create a new note after 50 notes if you are a free user. I suggest to users switch over to any other note app as soon as possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Amazing app, it's a life saver for me sharing notes, tasks, plans, files etc. between multiple laptops my family has."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The updates in the last couple of years put this app back on track"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Almost unusable because of all the ads and other pop-ups. A lot of features have been removed from general membership and limited to subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"BRUTAL! The app has locked the lists I made and won't let me access until I pay! I need some info I have on there, at least let me take my info and delete my account after. Or warn me you'll be blocking my access prior to doing so!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recently had to buy a new phone because my phone died. When I signed in to my Evernote account, 5 years of notes have completely disappeared. There is no indication of how to retrieve anything. All I get is a stupid pop-up asking me to pay way too much money for what I use the app for. I don't even have access to my profile so that I can sign out. I guess I just have to uninstall. Such a terrible waste of time. And, my notes are just gone in the wind..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is a great app for storing your notes! Notes can also be placed in separate notebooks. Evernote is always making improvements to make your life easier. I highly recommend Evernote for everyone who wants to simplify their life in a complicated world."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Turned into TRASH! I've used the app since 2012. Told tons of people to jump on it so your notes are not tied to a large tech platform. Now they've gone to price gouging! It's disgusting! I have over a decade of writings now held hostage. That's a betrayal! From 5 stars to 1 star! Good job, Evernote executives! *sarcastically applaudse*"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After being a loyal, paid Evernote user for many years, I couldn't tolerate the constant degradation of functionality and reliability with each new release. I finally migrated to OneNote a little over a year ago. Although there were some growing pains, I'm so glad to be free of the abomination that is Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once the best apps I have ever had. Right now I am no longer know what to say.. Really disappointed for let me down huhuhu..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good app but buggy, always gives me issues login back in the app. This can be so frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even look at my notes because of the limit reached pop ups begging to buy a subscription. I can't delete a notebook because of this either."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before it used to be a best note app and now it has become the worst note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best Locker Application for the Mobile 📱"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every 30 seconds there's an AD waiting for you. It's impossible to close it. Ads are waiting for you on every screen. The developers have killed the classic Evernote app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app to receive adds through, not sure the small note taking function included with the adds is worth it though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads. I click on one thing and they pop up like viruses. I get that they have to make money, but that is incredibly infuriating and I don't need to be sent to the download page for another app immediately after I click on an EVERNOTE feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can understand that the app may not allow to store any new note since there is no more free space, but at least let the user see the old saved notes. Cannot see even my old notes till we pay a heavy sum to subscribe. Pathetic."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a crock of garbage. Used to love this app and even did the one time payment for the premium over 10 years ago. Now that premium buy is moot and they just riddled their once amazing app with shameless plugging to get one of their hot trash subscriptions which has made this app an unusable pile of horse manure. Also its a note app. Why in the existence of humanity would anyone want to pay monthly or yearly to use a note app? Its 2025, everything pretty much syncs on the fly without one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Improved features could cause damage to your existing customer base. Not speed enough and easy enough as earlier. Lot of ads reflecting to purchase their plans for further use of this app. Must look for alternate apps now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using since before 2014. Used to be an amazing app. I'm disgusted 🤢 that you cannot get to notes now for like 3 minutes waiting for all the pop ups & ads to finish trying to enforce one now to buy subscription at a RIDICULOUS amount! Now there is suddenly a limit on notes.... and being PUSHED to pay for an app that isn't even nice anymore. ... Constant Ads now and may not add any more notes without upgrading and paying. Can no longer access offline! RIDICULOUS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can track the journey of the app from being one of the best to one of the worst. Had been using this for 5 years. But now has become a shitpile. Even the 4 star overall is because the older year ratings were really good. Doesnt even deserve 2 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When using my phone and going to my widgets tab, it always closes the app when reaching all the way to the bottom of the page. Please fix. Bumping up cause this is still not fixed..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deceptive and Disappointing I started using this app because it promised to be a simple, reliable place to store my valuable notes. It was great at first—intuitive, fast, and free of clutter. I invested time organizing my thoughts, tasks, and important information, trusting that it would remain a dependable tool. Then, everything changed. The app was flooded with intrusive ads, disrupting the seamless experience I once enjoyed. To make matters worse, they introduced an ultimatum: pay up or los"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has gone frow Wow to Frustrating in a matter of months. Posting non skippable ads when you need to open a note urgently is just not acceptable. I am migrating the notes to my native notes app which wont have all features but will do the job!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was useful when there was an option to sync multiple devices, instead of just one. Now, it forces you to pay. Even if you use it only on one device, it is full of ads. Uninstalling, won't pay for a glorified notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you are reading this, I suggest you look for another app or try using Notion. Evernote decided to put endless ads on their app and you can't ever perform a basic search. I'm moving away from this ridiculous app. Bye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 2024, 2025! Years later, search is still terrible! Presumably designed for US Apple-obsessed phone market rather than global. Often incredibly slow to open Notes. Needs big update. Really need to switch fully to Notion instead. 03/08/24 Now can't even see my notes on the app. How can they keep making it so bad?! Update 2025. Yep, search still abysmal. Type in 'shopping', will you get the most recent note called 'shopping'. No. Nor with AI. Sort it out!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Crazy high cost!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now it's just bugging you to pay for it & telling you about new features you don't want & don't care about. Another great app ruined by greed...seems developers never learn!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the... After 5 seconds in the app it asks for a paid subscription selection without any exit button... This is done at every app startup"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Obnoxious alerts about new features I don't care about but have to take a tutorial on before I'm allowed to use the app, then begging for a review, well here you go. Here's your review."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Moved Tagging Why was tagging moved to be harder to find on the app? This is frustrating..move it back, now it's gonna be harder to remember to tag my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"tired of nonsense. I pay to use this for note taking. keep disturb me for my note taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Insanely aggressive sales notifications. They want me to consider paying for this app in the free trial while completely ruining the UX by pestering me with pop-up notifications whenever I open the app and want to actually use it. You can't even close the pop-up in one tap, and it asks you AGAIN are you sure? Who designed this??? UX for new users is hilariously bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app, but now free version comes with full bunch of ads and you can work see the notes unless you watch them fully Moving to alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the update, it became impossible to access my account. The program became very, very complicated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Initially when I downloaded this app was free but now it is asking to subscribe with 499 Rs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very good example how a working app became so lame greedy after years.. cheers... use onenote or google keep.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Broken on a mobile. Hardly functions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Todays model of these kinds of dev is to lock there customer data in by offering it for free for some time then force them pay or punish them with ads, limit using app altogether. RIP EVERNOTE 2008 - 2020"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pretty bad experience with this app. Every time I open the app it forces and doe upgrade to paid plan. Now it's stated started showing unstoppable video ads. Pretty horrible UX. Showing ads to force subscription will only push people away"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've previously left a review. Still too many popups, too expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be really good. Now asking just for money. Disturbingly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I used to Love It when it was free. They got Greedy and when you reach you data cap you can't get to your saved notes and then your account gets wiped out if you don't pay after trying to log in after ? amount of time. It used to say I had to pay to get to it, now no recognition of my notes. So, use if you want to pay at some point. Otherwise get ready to discover all your lovely notes are gone forever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great program with new added features for continuous improvement. My 3 stars would be 5 stars if it was easier to print notes and export notes when needed. Does work flawlessly across devices with excellent syncing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. ITS A SCAM. I have been charged for a free account and they refuse to refund me. Asking for information like an invoice receipt and billing info when there is no billing info in my account. So many loops and holes to try to get my money back. If I could give 0 stars I would. I hope I get refunded and can close my account but at least if I save someone else from this mess I will be somewhat happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been using the app for 3 years now. It used to be so much better before now the frequency of the ads are increased to the extent that you are not able to use the app well. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im giving it one star i wish i could give half star, i believe they're becoming super duper greedy with the plans.., the Desktop version suoer laggy and takes for ages to log in.. not to mention the layout/interface isn't accurate at all when you try to click on things.. I've been using it for so many years and it used to be my favorite but it went downhill badly recent years... i could never recommend it. just use Onenote way better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be my best app for notes, but I have to give a 1-star now. Annoying ads and limited functions nowadays, i think this app is encouraging us to uninstall it rather than subscribe it. I will uninstall it real soon...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a member since Sep 2013. 11 years+ App is now too commercialised with so many pop ups appearing to lead us to buy the paid version. Disappointed. Only using the basic functions, the Personal plan is too expensive considering I'm only using the basic functions for note-taking. Propose to have a ""Personal Lite"" version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very bad experience with Evernote, last many year use this note app, this time my own note not show 1 mint in emergency situation to note personal data, disgusting"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"product is probably similar to one note the issue is they are doubling and tripling prices yearly with not much extra i use. I would change but a hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks a lot Program,we hope coder have healthy,lucky and succesfull life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good stuff"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm just logging into my old account (opened in 2010) and straight away got a message that limit is reached and pop up appears asking me to pay. That's it! I can only close the App. Good luck with your monetization."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My daughter bought this without my permission and not sure how to get a refund or how I go about it?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not happy that, without warning, I have no access to my notes and have to pay. I don't want all the fancy, schmancy new features as I already have other apps set up to do those things. And the disconnect of old devices that I no longer have does not work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its sad. Used to be my favorite app and still is. But no way am i gonna pay 15$/month for a notetaking app. There are literally hundreds of free open-source alternatives that work just as fine"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Welp, it was a 5 star free app, now because they keep pushing for subscription I'm locked out & will prolly have to pay to get to them. I work in telecommunications & need access to lock combos. They coulda just said i reached my limit while still having access but Noooo, they wanna be sneaky & greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So slow and bloated that it now effectively unusable. I'm not going to wait 15 seconds for a note to load"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed with this app. I used to save my notes on the app. Now I want to see them, there is no way unless I pay for it......I am totally disappointed with the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App won't install updates. Using Pixel 6a with latest OS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Each update removes more functionality since the acquisition by Bending Spoons. No more managing tags or bulk editing notes. If there is sync error it just deletes your data. Cannot turn off auto formatting. New windows app forced removal of old app. It takes more resources than chrome and is no longer localized so 10-20 seconds to do basic functions like add tag or open note. I paid 10 years, had 17gb of data, and was forced to reformat all, so many notes lost. Dangerous developers!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is still great but they have more than quadrupled the subscription charges to Rs. 6600/year from Rs. 1500/year. I will have to look for another note taking app that's less expensive. Sorry, folks. It's no longer affordable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worse every year don't buy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgusting ads method"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Glitches, 'ad-blasted' extortion, and total isolation from any of the mainstream players 😐 My experience is that I got seduced in to it through the 'free honeymoon phase', and over the years got dependant on her, confiding all of my little secrets, and when there was a gun(ads and the certain possibility of borderline-legal behind-the-scene data-selling to those ad firms)in my face, I had no choice but to cough up. Guess we are married now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Functionally good but it's the slowest app on my phone. Most of the others are free but I pay a subscription for Evernote. Why is it so slow?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Jadi makin luwemot, loadingnya ampun dah"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now the free plan can no longer sync 2 devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is still a very good app but I've downgraded it because it keeps sending annoying ads to upgrade. You can keep some features for the paid version and not send unnecessary ads every few minutes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"the constant updates and changes make it hard to use been using since 2011 and now it's bloated with features and costs 4x as much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many ads with the new update, annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Price increase is ridiculous. I'm cancelling before renewal is up. this product is NOT worth the price asking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every single time you open the app you are bombarded with full screen ads to upgrade to the most overpriced subscription I've ever seen. Super annoying to say the least."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is horrible to many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unstable and unusable. This app used to be awesome but now TOTALLY SUCKS! COMPLETELY BUGGY AND USYNC DEVICE FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK!!! Probably b/c they are trying to force people to pay to access their notes. Not going to happen, why would I pay for this when their are so many better free options?? Basic features don't not even work but all the adds popping up asking for money sure do! 💀 I don't think I would ever pay for this now that they have destroyed what used to be a great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have used this app for years and now they added video ads. Working to migrate my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"SERIOUSLY! Y'ALL ""DEPRECATED"" THE 'E-MAIL A COPY"" OPTION!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATED - The free version is unusable now. Every second touch/click leads to offers and ads. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good while it lasted free without ads. Now its turned into adware and forcing you to pay a subscription. I'm moving on from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become much worse. They want you to pay now for the app and can not add more notes. Too many better options in the Play Store to succumb to their payment demands. Not worth the fees."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't matter how many times you cancel this, every single year they will charge you. And every single year you will need to fight with them to get your money back. For years. Save yourself the hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free account is not only limited to 50 notes, but theres also a time limit... Im very disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whatever happened, evernote unable to render images"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for over a decade and it is unrecognizable from its original vision. the pushy monitization efforts and sheer greed of these developers should be enough to permanently put anyone off of using this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is it a joke? I can log into my account at the web browser, but I cannot log in with the same my credentials he app! I have to go back to Microsoft 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was repeatedly shown premium subscription offers in the app, despite dismissing them multiple times. When I finally selected ""Continue with ads,"" the app displayed a broken advertisement - just a black loading screen that wouldn't play properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm trying to get into the app. It says I'm at my limit. Then says I can upgrade. I do not want to upgrade, I'm trying to access my old notes, but it won't let me in! I use to love this app & used it a lot. Had I known i would be locked out of it, I would of never used it. I just want my notes that I have in the app. Please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The WORST possible notes app. Every click, they try to get more money out of you. Unless you want to pay hundreds of dollars a year to record a few simple notes... stay far away from this company. It should be illegal to charge so much while offering so little. Updating for 2025 and seeing all the other negative reviews along these same lines. Stay far away from this company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"good bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very laggy!!! update: Add open pdf in eveenote options"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a loyal user for 10 years, but the app has become unusable because of bugs and expensive. Now I am on free version, but cannot open my notes. the app demands to remove all devices from synchronization but cannot do it because of another more bug🤷‍♂️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Está constantemente a mandar spam a dizer para comprar a APP. Já não é prático para usar de forma gratuita."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's just become unusable with the pop up ads and requests for plans upgrades. For a note app the asking price is too high. Couple that with the app's inability to accurately track how many notes I have so it won't let me create a new note and I think I'm going to have to move on. Maybe it's worthwhile if you're a power user and the subscription cost is worth it but it's not for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, and the app ia trying to shove the paid upgrade down our throats!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't load attachment. Unable to download also."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not free, too much advertising. Very annoyed by ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be my favorite notes app because of the simplicity of it and the lack of ads. now when you open you have navigate through about 4 different pop ups to get you to spend money just to get to your notes and not to mention the layout changes and added features. would not recommend, find a different app to use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DEJEN DE INSISTIR EN MI SUBSCRIPCION SEA DE PAGA Los anuncios están inmersos de una forma muy poco amigable. Haganse un favor y utilicen otras herramientas como OneNote (sincronizacion automática con todos tus dispositivos IOS, Android, PC etc). Incluso notion No recomiendo para nada está aplicación"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The developers that work for Evernote are garbage can people who shouldn't be allowed to afford rent or ever find happiness."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use now. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to app for notes on desktop and phone. Now it's completely un-useable with all the pop ups and they lock you to one device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Keeps interrupting with ads to pay for their sub otherwise losing or not allowing you to add extra notes. Used to be good. Now very annoying to use unless you pay to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's even worse. I've used evernote very lightly for years to bookmark recipes. They have made it clear in the last year that if you're not paying, you suck and should go away. It's just awful. Only use it when I need to get stuff off it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why paid subscription??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been a good app, but their recent increase of almost 300% has forced me to cancel my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the greatest falloff from grace in modern times. This was my go to app for years, and I've grown so much working with this app, getting an idea and putting it ""on paper"" within seconds. Now on the other hand, using this app is like playing an boring game where the goal is to cancel out as many pop up windows you can in 2 fps. The shitification strikes again. Thanks for the wisdom you helped me achieve, but now you're just garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years and I my upgrade expired. I was asked to upgrade and decided not to for a period of time. I couldn't access my notes unless I deactivated several devices. I proceeded to deactivate devices and in this process I list all my notes I had for years. I've sent several emails to Evernote customer services, because they don't have a phone number to speak with anyone. The email I received was an automated one to do certain things that don't work. Need my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has completely changed, and for the worse..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the actual &!$# Evernote?? I used to love this app, then one day, I can't seem to log in. So I finally uninstall it and reinstall. I can get back to my notes but I'm hit with an ad every 25 seconds about going Pro. I'm not going to pay what I think was over $100/year for a service I can use for free elsewhere. Moving all my notes today and uninstalling for good. What a pain in the @$$."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give zero stars. Fix your login!! How am I supposed to enter two factor when I switch apps and you reset the screen???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad 😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect for students. Would recommend 💯"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can barely use this app, lots of adds, limited features on free plan, the app freezes a lot."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app out there, used to use it a lot. Now I'm going to painstakingly migrate everything. Because that process is still better than trying to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why I can't use the free version?!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to rate this app 5* in 2017 - you can image how long I have used it. But now I vote for 1*, you will be limited to only 1 device if you do not buy the premium version. The popup asked for your money is so annoying. For now, I found no reason to use this app when we have Notion synced between devices for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"became garbage. Ads to buy the premium version on every click while the app itself bugs non stop. didn't use the app for over a year, now tried to move all my files and suprise suprise, all my old files with images are unaccessible - the photos show error & I lost some data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Junk fill adds constantly try to sell items. Never launched successfully, after too many tries I deleted it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deleting this app since it's not useful anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"guardo todomas mis notas y no tengo que andar conectadome para buscar un dato. Creo mis notas en la PC del trabajo, y ya las tengo al instante en mi celular y la laptop de casa. ya no ando buscando donde lo apunte 👍🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started using this app sometime in 2022. I'm rarely on it but it seemed like a cool place to archive random thoughts. As I'm documenting this now, I cannot access anything I've put on the app because I've been mandated to subscribe to their paid service compulsorily or else my data there is forever lost. I guess this is one way to steal things from people. Only GOD knows how WhatsApp remains relevant in business all this while without troubling our lives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for annual service upgrade and never received the benefit so I deleted the app. Now they are trying to charge me again but the system will not allow me to login to cancel billing and delete accounts. This if not an app that I would recommend anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was super excited to use the free version of this app on my dell google chromebook for work and school, but th app does nit load for this type ofdevice after logging in. It would have been nice to know it is not compatable with my devce before creating an account. Many other reviews from users of chromebooks that i read after my experience have shared the same complaint. Please adjust the app! I would love to also have access on my device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updating the app unable to log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Corporate greed strikes again. Just use a different app that doesn't charge you more than it's worth."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're literally forcing us to pay, like we're being held on a virtual gunpoint. Ads and restrictions, and prices are too high."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Laggig, too much add, time consuming, restriction of synchronized devices is absurd"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a decent app until forcing subscription plans. Lost all my previous notes because ""device sync limits reached"" error comes up and won't go away. Absolutely terrible decision to force subscription plans and cut access to the user that have been using the app since the start!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to notes app but now it has become so inconvenient to create a note that I'm deleting the app. Upon opening it, you are immediately bombarded with requests to upgrade your account to premium. You have to navigate through multiple pop-ups to say no, only to have another upgrade pop-up block your screen when you enter a note! They don't want one or two dollars for this upgrade either, their current deal is $120 a year. Stick with your phone's notes app. You'll be better off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you Evenote for forcing me to successfully switch to Notion after four years of using your services. Good luck with your pesky little pay now to breathe attitude and good riddance. ❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gotten worst and is now the worst note program ever. I am sick and tired of the many forced ads pop-up like they are forcing you to buy their app. You cannot close the popups very easily because there isnt an X or close button. You have to agree with their stupid offers to proceed or back page more than once to get out. This app sucks and I hate it. Leave the app world Evernote. I am deleting you forever. Google Keep or Docs is 100x better and is FREE!!!!!!!! BYE!!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Popups trying to get you to subscribe to whatever stupid pay service they're pushing often don't have X buttons to exit out. It's possible to get them to close, but so so annoying. And it happens basically every time you open the app. I'm ready to uninstall, there have to be better options out there. All I want is to keep notes on my phone. I could probably just use a Google doc and it would be a much better experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app used to be fantastic and decently priced. now it sucks as it has less functionality than it originally did, is buggy and glitches a lot, and the price is astronomical. I am currently moving all my notes to another equally as capable and much more affordable option. I used to recommend Evernote to students and colleagues and now actively steer everyone away from it. I ultimately think that if there is not a Major course correction that this app will fail and fade into obscurity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now every update makes it worse. No support, whatsoever. Been trying to get a device logged on for months. Evernote CONSTANTLY loses data, the app crashes and freezes. Lots of new useless deprovements constabtly added. NOTHING EVER gets fixed. Garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ad every time I enter the app, before I can even edit or view my notes. Not recommended."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly bombarded with Ads and upselling on start up. App uses sneaky tactics by defaulting to paid plan each time...have to ""switch"" back to basic every time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I Used to really like the app. Was easy to use and would sync between my phone and tablet. Recently I had to individually delete old notes because I was all of a sudden 300 notes over capacity. There was no simple easy or quick way to delete the notes. Will be deleting and finding a new note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect note-taking app. Use it everyday. It's my most used app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this is the worst piece of software I ever paid for. just wanted to take quick a note and the app is fully frozen showing a ""what's new"" message (!). I could spend half an hour just writing down all the bugs. I don't understand why they just over years come with new functions and don't make sure the basic stuff is working and now slow. ADDITION: just cancelled the subscription, after rising the price from 30 to 85 / year. bad joke everything."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, used it for everything. Then they forced you to purchase and wouldn't allow access to old notes without doing so. I upgraded and didn't get any better. Now I'm trying to cancel and its a nightmare"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I havent use dthis app for 6 months. I wanted to log in but it says I can't access my old notes without payment. Wow. And look at all reviews. Sounds like nasty greed took over and now enjoy the consequences."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"when I try to login using email, and I have to send the app to background to get my password and mfa key from credentials manager apps, it sends me back to the first login page. I had to write down my mfa key on a paper and quickly do the login steps in one go, so that I can use the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a very good app, but since they started to forcing for paid AP, it has become impossible to access. Everything I open the app goes to a game promotion trying to have me installed. I do not recommend the AP, and I'm moving out of it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NEVER EVER DOWNLOAD THIS SCAM APP. First u will write your loved and Important notes in this Scam app and then this App starts To show infinite pop ups to buy their membership and sometimes they even block u from accessing your notes. It kind of blackmail to get their membership. Please don't download"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam! Once you have created your notes and stored valuable information within the app, they hold your data hostage and demand payment to keep using the app! You lose all the information, even if you're using the ""free trial"" version. Holding someone's data hostage and requiring credit card info to access it, while claiming to be a free app, is wrong."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry excuse for an app. Had to click ""not now"" and ""x"" on advertisements at least 5 times before I could see my notes. Uninstalled after using for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quality gone down And keep asking for money and hide ignore button so you can't see easily"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nothing is free in this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Using the app for years and then now being forced to pay or see long obnoxious ads Everytime I open the app is about as low class as it gets."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"As a long-term user of Evernote, I find this application much more advanced and usable, as it is ever evolving. As opposed to Microsoft OneNote, which appears to have been dumbed down and static. I have ditched OneNote and only use Evernote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like Evernote. I am not a pro user - my needs are simple - but I really like the fact that I can use it on all my different devices, and that its search functions work well. I do not consider it expensive at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wanted to love this.Why would I upgrade when you say we get 1gb free transcribing and 50 notes and you cut me off before I've even reached half of that? I have 19 notes and an error message pops up every time I try to create a new one. Also you won't let us delete pre loaded notebooks. Obviously not everyone is going to want those."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get spammed with their subscription ads all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for over a decade. Now there is no longer a free version I will not pay $130 per year for this app. Using this as an individual not using it in an office setting I will not pay $15/month. The multiple pop up ads are intrusive and the the button to exit or decline the offers are always tiny and blended in with the background and challenging to locate. It stores almost 15 years of recipes, research, and work and now I have to figure out how to remove all my notes to a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"so sick of unlimited amount of ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my original notes app and I used it (and loved it) extensively 10 years ago. Now it's overly expensive and the free version is too restricting. There have been major innovations in the note taking space. Currently using Obsidian, Logseq and Tana."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Downgraded to the free version after years of paying for the app, and now I'm completely locked out of viewing my notes. It prompts me to upgrade or unsync devices, and when I check all the devices to unsync, it takes me to a confirmation screen where I can't scroll and can't see a button to proceed to the next screen, so it's impossible to proceed. Evernote used to be good, and has become horrible for many years now. Use a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"New version. Thanks for the new way. Evernote Sketch for Samsung ultra is BLOCK. Thanks to résolve. I believe in the new team."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Just read the most recent reviews! I have ADHD and I recommended this app specifically for people with ADHD for years. I did purchase a subscription. But then they suddenly discontinued my plan and the only ones available were twice the price. But worse, when I couldn't log in I asked for help, they just never bothered to respond. Greedy !! I NEEDED all the info I put in Evernote FOR A LEGAL CASE. *** WARNING IF IT'S IMPORTANT DON'T USE EVERNOTE!!! ***"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It used to be great, but since ""bending spoons"" was added it has got very annoying. It keeps closing the note I had open before, which takes clicks and time to reopen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They start charging immediately after certain storage better to use keep notes Google which is free can download unlimited notes in more organised manner than this useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable app from the beginning, without paying for a subscription of course. And then so many steps to ""request"" your ""private data"" be ""erased"" when you attempt to permanently close your account. Goodluck even finding the button."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute disappointment. I will be quick. They try (successfully) not to attract users to the paid version but to chase away from the free one. They started by reducing the number of notes, then the number of devices, then endless pop ups. Now, which is the worse for me, they have pop up ads with sound, which take time when you want to keep a note urgently but also deter you from opening the app when in class, meeting etc, because a stupid, noisy app starts playing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good to go"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been a great way for me to keep track of important documents!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best Transcribe capabilities. ( hand writing to text is so accurate and fast ) .I have tried all other apps. Evernote has the best . this feature alone is gold ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Having notes on my phone and computer was incredibly convenient. As the app grew, it changed, which is understandable. However, there were annoying changes as well. Notes were limited to a certain number. Okay, now you can pay to upgrade; I can understand that. But the amount of times it asks if I want to upgrade is ridiculous. Every single time I open the app. And then more depending on what I click. And NOW there's ads with sound. In a notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"ভাই"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increasingly and unnecessarily complicated. Requires an internet connection. Persistent and ever increasingly intrusive nags to buy the premium subscription. And now they've deactivated my account without warning."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update broke it. Won't sync now. Uninstall/Reinstall does not fix. Search completes ""evernote syncing temporarily paused"" and has results from 2023 .

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am a Paid user paying 1500 per year since 14 yrs. Yesterday suddenly got msg to my email that i need to pay 3999 per year.This is too expensive for a note taking app. Sonce we hav saved a lot of sensitive info we r bound to pay the new rates.I suggest the app manager to reduce the price for annual subscription to Rs.2000 which is reasonable. Hope u wil take action."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really love the dark theme, but the initial splash screen is still white which is a not very eye friendly. Please change that too. Edit: Solved, thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Found a bug. Assume user opens note number 10 from a huge list of notes. Now when the user clicks back, the focus gets reset to note number 1 everytime. This is an inconvenience. I expect it to just go back where I should see note number 10 so that I can proceed my activity further."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dead App No reason to use this app because it is incredible difficult to find value in it. Completely different from what it once was years ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used free version mainly to organize my thoughts for multiple book projects and stepped away from its use during a long period of time about 4+ months to deal with more urgent family matters. When I logged back in it wouldn't let me access my materials unless I paid $77 saying I had used up all of my space. So instead of giving me access so I could delete some things and remain on the free version. I was forced to make such a huge payment. Not worth it 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Have been using Evernote for more than a decade and it has followed me from iPhone/Mac to Android/Windows with minimal issues. The work the new ownership has put into it is really starting to show through this year. Hopefully the features keep improving."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why do you keep releasing+forcing new features that disrupt the usability of the app? For christ sake all we need is a reliable cross-platform note taker.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop forcing to get subscription. Impossible to use free version with enormous amount of ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Getting worse with every update. I've been a paying customer for 10 years and it's time to find something else. This app gets less and less usable with each update."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for many years as a notepad. One on paid subscription and one on free account. The free account is becoming like trash now, cannot add notes, cannot add notebook, ads keep popping up and unable to close even after the advertisement. I think they are just trying to push all the users away. I have never seen an app that's so pushy with paid subscription. The prices of the paid subscription is so expansive now, price was increased without informing. I'm done with this app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app for note taking, I used it for DnD, however recently it's become a buggy mess that's just trying to get you to spend a few more bucks on it so it can work how it's supposed to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1/1/25 update. Stay away! Do not start using this app as it is collapsing because of greed. Evernote went from 4.5* to 3.0* rating because the people who are running it are dumb. They now only allow you to sync 1 device and your computer browser counts as one. They try to charge you $78 to keep your phone and computer browser synced! Never ending ads!!! Used to be my go to for notes but now every time I open it they are spamming with ads to pay to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was gonna leave 2 stars but other reviewers are making good points I forgot. I've had the app since 2017 and the free version now is useless. I recorded a 2 hour lecture in class today and it just vanished. Went to reach out to support, NOPE lol you can't chat or EMAIL without paying. What a joke. I'm moving my notes and uninstalling. Edit: I downloaded the app to screen cap my notes for my new device. I forgot I moved to notion lol anyway, I wasn't even able to LOOK at my notes w/o paying."

It used to be more of a customer centric product..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was a great app to use for years. Unfortunately now with the ads, it has become unusable for jotting down or referring to quick notes, as it forces you to watch nonsense first. Sad to say it's time to uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$130 per year paywall for a bare minimum word document app? I used this for years, but that's actual insanity. Never seen a company burn a bridge this intensely since Activision/Blizzard. I'd rather start carrying a pocket notebook again and shove an entire package of Bic pens up my binghole before I gave you a single dollar of my hard-earned money. Scummy. Predatory. Complete BS. Get bent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for more than a decade. It has become so slow it is painful. There are better note taking apps out there. I migrated my 1600 notes to Joplin and I'm quite happy."

I used it since 2018 but now in 2024 i can only log in with one account and can't make new notes eventhough it is below the 50 limit. The intrusive popup ads are making it unusable. Also there is a constant reminder to subscribe which makes it unusable. Now I will uninstall and say goodbye to evernote. Now this app is just a horrible cashgrab greedy company. Guys stay away."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was once a great (the greatest?) note taking sustem. We used it to take all types of notes about everything. Until... They wanted more money from users. To do that, they started restricting how you may access your notes. Unless you pay money, you can't access your notes from a phone and the website at the same time. And you are bombarded by very annoying ads requesting you to pay to continue getting access. This is very foolish. Just show regular ads and stop this foolishness."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I haven't been able to log in for months now and have no way to recover my notes.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE 12/28/24 Evernote now holds long time users hostage by not allowing normal access to important information on longstanding notes.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go-to app for note-taking, but the recent shift towards aggressive monetization and intrusive ads has been disappointing. It’s frustrating to see core features locked behind a paywall, and the constant ads disrupt the user experience. It's time to explore alternatives. To the developers: Stop alienating your users with greedy tactics. Listen to the feedback. If you continue to disregard your users, Evernote will become a cautionary tale of what not to do."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is truly unbelievable! How come that you cannot sync with two devices without any kind of subscription? How is that even sync if there's one device.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I sad, but say goodbye to Evernote after more then 10 years of using and subscription. It has been a perfect tool for the fair price, but it's not for me anymore. Changing in the app and steeped price made it too bulcky for me. Sad and disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have to update my review here as the de team has been putting a lot of effort on updating the experience and making Evernote reliable. It's still hard for me to see the value of the new price, but I understand they didn't charge for long enough and had to pass that on.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works flawlessly, $6.80 monthly if paid yearly, only if paid on desktop website as opposed on mobile"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Say its free then force me to download the app and no thing is free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's buggy. I often record audio notes only to find they're either corrupt or gone. What a waste of my time..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be really good and productive. I had it on my android and iPhone both. Now adverts, and this culture of subscription model is really daylight robbery. Why can't you provide excellent service as a software without mucking up the quality and price of the app? I moved on to onenote, keep notes and apple notes. I can't be asked to ever come back to this application. A waste of time, space and money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version was good. Way too expensive to pay for. I'll be going elsewhere now there are too many ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Niche application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favourite app for saving notes and personal info, been using it for over a decade now. Permanently closed my account today due to this new update of tooo many ads. Cant even open my notes, have to click million times to exit the ads before i can do anything. Bye forever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A trash since the last update. Everything is paid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be good apps but now you need to pay for every features that you can get for free is really stupid, don't download this app, GO for Color notes it's pretty decent apps than this, and they had google backups too for Free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this as my primary note taking app until I recently lost my phone. I wasn't even allowed to sign in to my own account on my new phone without purchasing a subscription. The sign in failed on every phone, tab, laptop, Firefox & Chrome. Frustrated, I purchased a month subscription & the app ""miraculously"" started working again. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE EVERNOTE ACCOUNT ANYMORE. Take your backups and run away fast from Evernote. I just wanted to put this review before I uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"we use this at the office for all of our records, and it's exceptional! So quickly, I can pull up anything we've ever done. We also use it for scheduling jobs and it's very reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent 👌👌👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"terrible app make it usable on mobile browser"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A garbage can"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be an excellent note-taking app, but recent updates have made it worse. The constant prompts to upgrade are intrusive, and the new restrictions on note creation for free users are frustrating. Despite having only 26 notes, well below the 50-note limit, I’m unable to create new ones. These changes, along with the push to upgrade, have turned Evernote from one of the best apps into a disappointing experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy and now I can't log in, I reinstalled the app a few times but now I can't recover my account...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads. It's getting more and more annoying. I'm looking to export all my notes into another notes app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Intrusive ads and predatory billing screens trying to force you to buy a subscription. There are better free alternatives then this money grab of a product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. But for some time now, it is giving me lot of headache to manage. ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous now that they constantly shove ads into users' faces. Takes longer for me to get through all of the clutter and pop up nonsense they throw at you, than it takes for me to write/read the bloody note. Heeding other users' suggestions and migrating all of my notes out of this scummy app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"if you are now ready to pay for it, don't even try it: adds are simply invasive and sometimes inappropriate, consider them as spasms. I'm happy to have migrated all my notes to OneNote, totally removed Evernote and recover peace of mind."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Let op: scam! Prijzen zijn verhoogd van 59€ naar 99€ zonder aankondiging."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now this is purely junk filled with ads and annoying subscription popups. Subscription price is absurd as this is just an notes app. I have only 23 notes yet still it says limit reached. Time to say good bye for this app. EDIT: Tired of useless Fullscreen ads, uninstalled today. Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just found out that ny existing notes had disappeared and I do not know why? Monetization which includes in app purchase for their upgrade keeps on popping while navigating the app. Definitely uninstalling. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Insane how an app created by bending spoons, something that seems disability-friendly, doesn't have a setting for not rotating, even if screen rotation is not enabled in the system. It makes comfortably using it in bed impossible. It also asks you to pay for using it on more than one device for way too much. Just use Obsidian people, it's free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good note keeping apps, but not anymore. Keep on pushing for subscription plans. Tbh, it was a good free app, but not good enough to subscribe. But the pop-up subscription plans add is still can be tolerated. Then comes the stupid decision. Instead of improve the pay apps to attract more paid users, they reduce the free features instead. They limit the number of devices and notes for free users. Then, comes worse decision. To put pop-up adds that take ur precious time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not recommend to use it, too much adds, leaving this app after using more than 10 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love using ecernote to organize and cross reference my art supplies. now I can find any stamp stencil paint dies and paper at one search!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After getting annoyed with the constant upgrades switched to OneNote and have been really happy with it. I had 1000s of notes in Evernote and I was able to transfer them using a third party app. 2012 Review: Really very useful application!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage, unusable due to the new Ads which apparently are never ending so you can't even use the app. If you were my friend I'd disown you. Everyone at bending spoons should be ashamed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"عالی"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great tool. paid version too expensive compared to other apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite note-taking app, use it for years but now they limit you to one notebook and 50 notes on the free plan and are expecting you to shell out $130 to upgrade. Absolutely ridiculous especially when there are better free alternatives out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is ABSOLUTELY horrible these days. When I was using it back then, it had a minimal amount of ads. The amount of ads has gotten absolutely unbearable these days, there are just so many ads on this app with every click of a button that makes it absolutely horrendous to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Seriously guys...ads????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had the premium version of this app for years. My review was always 5 star. Every update it gets suckier. They've taken away the clipboard, added things I don't need. AND with this new ""beta"" stuff, I couldn't even get into the app without accepting their bloated features. Now I can't copy anything and paste it at all. Once again they fixed a great app that wasn't broken. I'm very dissapointed and looking for another cross device app to keep my journals in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've tried many note taking & thought organizing apps. Evernote was always my favorite choice because of its excellent feature set. Now because of unreasonable price increases I have switched to Google Keep. It's not the best but it meets my needs and best of all it's free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since I upgraded to the paid account all it does is crash crash crash. I click a note, click home, click Notes, and crash. I have to close out the app and restart it, same damn thing every time. I hate it so much but I have 835 notes on it. How can it be so terrible AFTER I start paying $15 a month for it? They have a the features in the world now but the most basic function crashes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ads make it unbearable to use anymore. Ugh, gross..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful app. The sketching feature (which is the only thing I needed it for) is completely non functional and now that I don't want to commit to the subscription having seen that it's so bad it's seeming very difficult to unsubscribe. Avoid at all costs if you want to draw notes or if you don't want to be locked in for an expensive subscription!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Can't even open the app or access notes without pop ups and ads. The best option is to move all notes into Google Keep Notes and delete this awful app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Superb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had the app for a week and then it broke entirely. Even the support page is barely usable to submit a ticket for troubleshooting. It's not free, you will be locked out so don't bother unless you can afford 15/mo for a note app. Even if you do pay, expect syncing issues, sharing issues, difficulty adding accounts, and an interface that explains almost nothing with no way to learn the apps functions outside of external research. Don't bother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's getting worse and worse...they are trying to force you to get a subscription. Now with the free plan you can do almost nothing. I have just 19 notes but they say I've already reached the limit of 50."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't get all my saved notes back again due to useless ads asking for payment. Nonsense app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I liked it initially, but it recently implemented ""Spaces"" for notebook organization that I cannot delete. Ruining my organization."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only Add"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Decreasing the number of notes and notebooks you can use unless you pay . Was an terrible idea . It means I can't access my whole notebook library going back to 2016 . It just reeks of greediness"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the paid version of this app for a long time, it used to be my favourite. It's great for searching keywords and sorting notes, I use it for recipes, journal entries and writing stories. Had to start duplicating everything when I lost content and fear it happening again, now I can no longer print from Android and have to go between two devices. So many frustrating bugs that have been submitted and continually ignored. Will be pulling all notes and moving elsewhere, waste of money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Unpredictable behavior"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You introduce a new feature of daily goals which is just spam and can't get rid of it. I have to cancel this subscription as it's literally spam that can't be enabled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a member since 2015. It has been great until recently. Ads have become very intrusive and all over the place. I am struggling to use the app with recent updates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked my notes behind a paywall. Hostile company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you begging for money this badly?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have had many problems with Evernote like crashing with new updates, shared notes crashing or some notebooks taking too long to open but the developer team has been fantastic. They release fixes and updates regularly. As a user I'm happy to see so much work and dedication being put into it to give the users an incredible experience. Also can we please have functionality to share the spaces now that we have them on personal plan too please!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app sucks. I just want to make a note and I have to click through three pop-ups to be able to get to the note screen. It's unresponsive and incredibly limiting. I'll be using the free notes app on my phone from now on because this is just a painful experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Defo not worth it, anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update Dec 2024: Unusable coz of ads Update Dec 2023: The app reached a new low today. It now has a restriction to create just 50 notes. I have saved over 3k notes. Suddenly they have changed their policies. Very unfair. I'm frustrated! *** Review from 2014: I have been using this App for several years now and the best part is that it gives you flexibility of keeping all your notes in sync. The functionality which allows to send notes via email directly to your evernote is extremely useful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep playing ads on No subscription. Worthless app ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be good but the ads have become completely unbearable. Glad I just discovered Google Keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really good app but these guys are getting too greedy. Can only use 1 device and even that is a hassle when they are bombarding you with their upgrade plans.very difficult to navigate within the app now. Would really recommend you ditch this and switch to standard notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I upgraded to a paid plan and lost all my old notes. I'm so disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I need and archivist, please let me know of better one than Evernote, Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No recognition of data on old phone, might as well shop around if I'm starting over anyways."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used a lot for a long time up until a few months ago and it was pretty good. Then the draconian limit on notes made me give up and put all across to OneNote which took a bit of time but I'm glad I did! Genuinely surprised it is still an ""editor's choice""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for 13 years as it gradually got better and then got much worse. The free tier is totally worthless and it is bombarded by upgrade notifications constantly. Just use a different app. I deleted it today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update created lots of new empty notes and notebooks. App then tells you you are over limit for free plan. Even after deleting all the empty notes and notebooks to below free limit, it still says account is over the limit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This was my go-to app back in the day with my HTC Evo phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So over run with pop-ups to upgrade & pay that I just got sick of opening it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not sure if you still think you are the best and people will spend that much of money for this ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very good note taking so, but since the latest update it won't stop rising the screen despite our being turned off in the android settings"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app, but at the miment it is essentially a useless free trial. Notes are not synchronized for offline use anymore, and anytime one tries to copy - paste, unkillable ad videos make it impossible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I liked the new improvements that Evernote has made. Kudos. Many of which have made it my go-to app for such a long time. But, at almost $18 month/$170 yearly. And limited amount of devices. Just absurd... With the plethora of note taking apps available out there now, ABSOLUTELY NOT. I'm out. Microsoft 365/One Note is just as powerful and way more versatile with Office Suite tools. For half the cost! And no limit of logins (that I'm aware) Come on Evernote... You guess are really reaching here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My second brain"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Cambio de 5 a 2 estrellas. Años usando esta aplicacion pero la nueva versión con publicidad sencillamente no sirve. La publicidad se queda y no se puede acceder a las notas."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Does what it says"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage. This used to be a great app. Now you can't get very fat past the log in screen before a pop up happens, covering the entire screen, that wants you to subscribe, and there isn't a way to close it other than exciting the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I can no longer take a screenshot just cos I used the password protection feature... I mean I wrote the words in those notes, yet now I have to copy and paste them somewhere else to be able to take screenshots... why would you add that feature? All new notes will be made elsewhere since I can't protect and take screenshots"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has became unbearable to use in the free version and their rates are so disrespectfully high, it's not even worth paying for. They're so forceful with their offers, made everything difficult or inaccessible to make you pay for things that were free before and even exporting your content is a pain in the butt. I've moved on and am paying for a competitor app at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2015, I used to use it to write poetry and to jot down quick notes, I never paid for it cuz I was a student and my usage of the app didn't require all those good features, now I'm shocked with the overwhelming amount of ads, I tried a couple of times to write down my concepts, I couldn't bear this excessive amount of ads. I decided I'm exporting my notes to Google Keep, it has less features but it's quick, minimalistic with no ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free Version is very irritating. Asks to take premium to add notes. Seriously? Uninstalled 👍🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit for taking notes and too many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My phone keeps getting better and more powerful, but Evernote performance keeps getting worse. Year after year, I see diminishing, which means this is my last year paying for the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do not use this app very often, now i can not access or log in. A total waste. How do i get my notes back please? Would absolutely not recommend this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Cool 😎.Daw"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too expensive. Bending spoon killed it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is not allowing me to access my notes. I see they are there but it is trying to force me to upgrade in order to see my notes! Please fix this and allow me to access what is rightfully mine."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Was 5 stars for years but the new changes suck. 2 main reasons: 1. Hate the redesign, please at least give us the option to default to the old home screen. Why make it more combersome to access my docs? Why even have shortcuts if they are now tucked into the options menus and harder to access? I just want to open the app and reference/edit things quickly. I had a well flowing system that was just undone by surprise. 2. Pricing + new limitations combine to greatly hurt user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App became slow and unresponsive. Desktop version is especially bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst add experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer allows me to email notes to outside source?? Was easy as share... not anymore... why?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Better use one note by Microsoft It's free... I have lost my Instagram business authentication code... I hope your company will reach bankruptcy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trashes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable, there is a constant popup claiming the limit has been reached and it is forcing their ridiculously expensive monthly plan. It is pathetic to charge this much for a service which is nothing more than a database for text notes running on inexpensive cloud storage. You get very little for in return for what you pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm only using it because I have notes previously created in it. App is getting worse with each new update and constantly crashes on random actions. With the new update they changed the default home screen without even giving you an option to revert to the old one which I used and loved. It's a terrible user experience, this APP is just keep on devolving. Will transition my notes to some other application whenever I get time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I got this because you can write offline on both PC and phone and it syncs and saves. The new note update however created tons of notebooks I didn't want. I had to delete everything manually. I accidentally deleted a wrong notebook and notebooks can't be restored. All notes of said notebook go into the trash, I tried to recover those which ones again all has to happen manually. All the notes went into another notebook and it became a giant mess. I'm looking into switching to obsidian now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Overkill for note taking on a phone and way too expensive for its usefulness. Managing fonts and formatting can be frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will be uninstalling this app due to the adverts. It was a great app up until the adverts started will be migrating it to my native app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible! After saving a lot of notes the app tells me the limit is reached and I need to subscribe, but that's OK. What's not OK though is that I can't access those notes again without subscription!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"You fixed it! Amazing... (old comment: 'Home screen is just horrible for workflow, please make it option')"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be a great app. Now bombarded with adverts and constant reminders to subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was amazing before they introduced annoying non skip able ads. I agree they need to earn money but why can't they have skipable ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its now bombarded with Unskippable Ads for free version, unusable. Been using it since january 2015..wow its almost 10yrs. Will now uninstall and switch. But still, thank you evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I really love this app. It deserves 5 stars. But, I have to say goodbye as the annual subscription has almost tripled in price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreliable and horribly overpriced!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not cost effective. Not a practical asset. More like liability"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is super slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now you have to click past 3-4 ads just to open a note. Just a never-ending avalanche of ads makes the user experience absolutely terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be my favorite app but now it's one of the worst applications. I switched to Samsung note since this app wants everyone to use its premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"real problems logging in via android app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years. Now they moved over to a pay subscription and have basically kidnapped my information. There is no way to even access my notes without paying the $14.99/mo fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too much effort spent on rolling out new features that no one has asked for (clients are not polled or approached) instead of on maintaining seamless functionality of core features. The platform remains much more buggy since Bending Spoons took over, but at least some of the core features that were broken since early in 2024 have now been fixed. Upgraded from 1 star. ~Premium client since 2012"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't even let me create a login to try it out... Reading all the negative reviews I am just not going to bother"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. It has become super annoying after they spam with 2-3 video or games ads per minute. Time to leave the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So complicated! can't even open the document!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it is getting worse to be honest. I dont know why. previously I can't use it anymore in my android phone (zenfone 8) cause it kept crashing and become useless. Now it happens too in my android tablet (samsung tab s9 fe). So what should I do?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Been using this app to write & catalogue media reviews & an assortment of miscellaneous notes for years. I appreciate that it syncs across both my mobile & desktop devices, but the interface could really use some work. While selecting text to delete or copy/paste, more that I've highlighted is always cleared—the workaround being to manually delete text & forgo copying/pasting entirely. Update: a fix for the widget not displaying a specific notebook has been applied."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"like service but too expensive now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not even allowing to use existing old notes without subscribing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The developers at Bending Spoons seem to be totally incompetent or are being pressured to perform horribly. No self respecting developer would intentionally butcher what was previously a fantastic app that served a simple purpose. Now, its just a sad reflection of its former glory"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stay away. This used to be a free service and was at some stage even reasonably good notetaking app, but now you can't even create more than 50 notes and 1 notebook and use on more than 2 devices without paying for a subscription. Saying I am disappointed in this company is an understatement. I thought this would be a place where I could store my notes forever as the name suggests. But their greed has caused them to degrade the functionality of the app to the place where it is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Invasive. All time asking for payment features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have now frozen my notes unless I pay. This is blackmail. I am so angry. I will NEVER use them again. I can understand limiting them or telling me I can't do any more notes, but they are absolutely frozen! I can't access years of study notes unless I pay!! Error."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was forced to move all my notes to Notion, it's impossible to use the app with all the ads and the popup subscription message."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unskippable ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Loved this app for a decade! Am a retired grandma who loves a web based file box for my hobbies, camping notes & things I'm interested in. So it appeals beyond business use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Shittiest app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have to view adds so i can read my own notes!?!! Goodbye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A greedy company that just wants to increase it's revenue by making the free version unusable. The app is also extremely buggy, even after many years of updates. Been a user since 2019. Used to be good. Now it's just trash. Will be switching to Notion or Obsidian."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app for note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This App is paid App now, and I'd like to take a backup of my notes that's recorded for sometime in there so I could uninstall it. It's totally unfair to block the view of my notes also with the constant subscription popups. Can something be done so that I could move my notes and uninstall? I don't desire to subscribe as such"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great way to improve our life's. Best note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to pay for premium but the price increase this year was ridiculous. Now my subscription has expired it won't let me unsync my other devices and so I have no access at all. Fortunately I exported everything into OneNote. Its not as good but my 365 sub is way better value for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"too many advertisement"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i want old theme good morning logo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Works on my iPad and my Samsung phone but I have tried opening it on 2 Acer Chromebooks as well as a Samsung chromebook and it will not load after logging in. It's just a black screen that says share logs and the Evernote symbol at the top. That is all I get. Wanted to try it for school but if I can't use it on all of my devices then there is no point in even attempting to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be so reliable for a free note taking app, I could still work with the constraints, but now they are pretty much inconveniencing you if you don't pay them. If you are like me, someone who would they need to write down notes in meetings or need to refer to them ASAP, don't bother, they force a whole video ad on you and you hv to wait for it to finish, unless if you are willing to pay a huge amt for it to go away. Deleting this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years, but they have finally restricted the features of the app to such an absurd degree that it is no longer useful for even the most basic applications."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update: Dec 2024, the app has too many unskippable ads, time to uninstall!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you preventing us from viewing notes we prepared? At least let us view our notes and make the things you want to be premium. It is just not fair to keep us from viewing notes we prepared that might contain important information that we need to review."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"makes tasks, notes, a schedule, everything key for effective work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new owners treat the app like some garbage app with a ton of apps and horrific annoying messages you have to figure out how to dismiss."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This has been by far the most helpful tool I've ever used for organization, productivity, and journaling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used free version, lost notes and it's trying to charge me. Avoid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Seems like the note disappearing issue is fine now (after signing out and signing in again). However, I do wish that there was a lite version (for mobile AND PC's), because the new UI looks very fancy and has great new features, but most of us do not have the most cutting edge smartphones and PC gaming rigs to run it efficiently. I remember the legacy versions on both platforms run so much faster and did the job, but they have been discontinued and are no longer supported online for some reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a horrible app. Used to be reliable and worth the cost. It's way too expensive now and sucks performance wise. Just deleted it for good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's time to say goodbye to this mostly used notes app of the past few years. For the last few days, the app has been displaying ads when opening and closing each note. It has become irritating to open any note without seeing ads. Thank you for making this app more convenient to use but disappointed for ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Serious cash grab. First thing when you open the app? buy a subscription! Want to make notes after 7 days? Buy a sub! do we optimize our app? definitely not. Not even an undo feature for accidental deletes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App allows you to use it for free for 7 days then it will charge you a weekly fee. While trying to delete my account, because I refuse to pay for a service like this, I have had to verify my email address five times, each time clicking out of the window on my phone to verify and then having to re-verify because it closes the previous window!! NOT WORTH DOWNLOADING!! Zero stars!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor audio transcript feature"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Info held for ransom, paid my one off fee when i started, now they switched to subscription and unable to see my data. Ripped off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been in Evernote user for close to 10 years. I used to have the paid version but I didn't use it enough to justify the $100 or so bucks a year for it so I went back to the free version and it was plenty good enough for me. The last few years they've been pushing their subscription plan more and more aggressively and limited the amount of notes I was able to have. But in the last year they completely blocked me even accessing or viewing all of my previous notes unless I pay $15 a month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need to learn from peers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible ever since the introduction of ads whenever you open the app. Ads that can't be skipped that takes 30 seconds to more than 1 minute. And the aggressive subscription prompt is utterly ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is a veteran note taking app that had quite the renovation recently. I switched from another app to Evernote because of reliability and out of the box experience it offers. I am very glad to have made the switch."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"What my phone was resetted and now the app is not working. I have been getting a note that the app is no longer compatible with my phone. Please what do I do to use it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use Evernote for my daily reflections, for capturing interesting quotes, for documenting meetings, for recording memories for my memoir."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Where should I send a complaint email? Your advertisement said your software limit is 1 Notebook and 50 notes. My Notebook is only 1 and my notes is just 35 ! But, I can't write new notes, why???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was good. It sucks now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need to access my information. How can I do this? The app keeps asking me to pay, I ve necer subscribed to any paid version, but I can't access my info."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great free app. Then, they decided to become a paid app and locked down your data until you paid to get it back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is broken you can't even sign into it with 2FA authentification, you sign in with username and password, then switch to the 2FA app code generator, and Evernote loses its sign in, it makes you start over. So it's not possible to sign in on your phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hard to work with"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Price goes up year after year and offer nothing more than a reskin ever few months. Go f$&k yourself. Went from $69 a year to almost double the price to $129 a year. For note storage. Notes have such a low storage rate it's embarrassing they think they can justify these prices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is utterly ridiculous, cant do nothing without being bombarded with those stupid subscription plans and the constant needing and begging to get you to plan a subscription. That on its own is a major red flag i love the app and can use it for my personal things and has its unique little mechanics but the subscription plan thing throws me over the bridge"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"So I paid for the premium version because my boss said that it was good and he wanted me to use it for the work that I do and for the most part he wasn't wrong like it has some good features. But this is for the desktop version. The mobile version I regularly run into glitchy issues where it straight up will put random pieces of text and basically mess up the formatting of the notes that I've done when I switch between the mobile and the desktop version. I don't know what the miscommunication is"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its a useless app after recent restrictions and high cost for removing ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Not a fan of the new UI. Also, the app is ridiculously buggy - I don't like how it fails to sync in real-time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You suck evernote. My notes didn't last forever as you claimed. You won't even give me access to them. You are keeping my notes hostage(for ransom) like a criminal!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it was the perfect app from the begging and i kept my full subscription for many years. now Evernote is losing its userbility and functioning, getting less and less attractive with each renewal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible with new update!!!! Was good earlier... Now completely unprofessional .. Loud Ad keeps popping up for every start."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many limitations for free users, a note is only few kbs of data's I don't understand why you keep making more limitations."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rubbis App! Absolutely disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Tl;Dr:If you don't mind paying for it, it's fantastic. Used to use Evernote exclusively. Then got locked out of it all unless I pay. Which unfortunately I have to. Then again, I should have been backing my stuff up anyway, but still felt sorta scummy of them regardless imo. Would love to have premium, but there's lots of FOSS that's very flexible out there too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice way to collect notes and articles ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I only left when I started having sync problems. I would type a note and then minimize it, only to come back and find it gone. It was so painful. But aside from this, it is a good note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The program now has ads on free version. They will do anything to sell the program dont ever buy it. Even text upload is so slow..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad with ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How do I cancel my subscription? Going into the app it says I need to cancel through google play but Google play doesn't have it listed as a subscription to cancel!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I was LOCKED OUT because I reached my limit without upgrading. So, I upgraded my subscription. But. NOTES or portions of notes are still missing. When I tried to ""download?"" or ""sync?"" them, it just looped indefinitely. NOT HAPPY"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be functional - Now it's a waste of time and money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Thank you for expanding the limits for free version users. Why remove ""Recents"" from the shortcuts? If some didn't like it, you should have put it at the bottom of the page, but you shouldn't have removed it! It was so helpful. PLEASE bring it back! Older: Wow. Take away the ability to use the free version without it being nearly useless to a new user. And the price you demand for the paid version is astronomical for most. It seems that you only want to cater to the rich. So be it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How could you delete all the files that I have stored there for years, without any warning! I can't believe you did this! That's just appalling!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for free for a number of years and used it to store some small useful information. Now they require payment and I can't access this information. I am very upset as I was not informed this data would be locked! This is a data hostage situation and I will never ever pay for something that is mine! Do not use this app as you may have to pay more than you expected. I would give this app zero stars if I could!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Give it a year before it folds. Absolutely worst trash out there Google Notes will pretty much end this unsecure mess of an app that has plans so expensive it would be better to write stuff down in a notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately the app is slow and very glitchy, with each update comes a new issue. On occasion the app does not autocorrect, allow me to send emails or synchronise to my other devices. This delays my working process significantly. I am on a paid version, I shouldn't have to pay for something that does not work properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for this for a decade. The paid version is now as bad as ppls complaints about the free version. Dont buy it. It used to be so functional, and was for about a decade. Now, it's so clunky and miserable to try to use, that i keep trying other apps on search of what evernote did easily up till 2-3 years ago. Edit: today was the day my yearly sub. cost would have skyrocketed, so i've exported everything and will give far less money to a better program. Stay away from this failing app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Remind me why I shouldn't delete this app because of your growing ads and use Google keep instead ???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now the application has become an adware app. Not possible to use the notes due to the advertisement. Not possible to skip the advertisements. Browser is loading always. I am going to stop using this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has always worked well for me and I've been a user for 6 years about. I use to keep notes for my RPG games. But this price increase is disgusting and not worth it for what I'm using it for. Nearly doubled my yearly sub for a personal use account. From $70 to soon $130. I'll keep it and find something better and much cheaper. Price increase like that in this economy? Lost your minds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unless you plan on paying - pos notes app.. cant use more than 1 device at a time. cant swap devices more than 3 times per month. teeny limit on total notes... booo all the way around these days. years ago, it was great. now - money grab. byyyeeee"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hitherto a very good platform, because of greediness, I say that Evernote you lost your relevance. I'm getting ad related to playing games, games, games,etc., trading, some most inappropriate ads. Whether I came to evernote for studying or for some other reason?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad and High subscription rate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app I've used for years but it's now unusable. It's full of adds. It's a horrible completely impossible experience now,.so I'm moving my notes elsewhere. Good luck with your dying app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a free member since 2013, and let me tell you, it's not something I recommend. Every single click is an advertisement to just subscribe. It's worse. Horribly worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app for notes ever made"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't log in after update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Watching ad to view my note? Bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great option for noting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have always found this app very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Where's the value in Evernote? Today's service is unrecognizable as the service I've loved since 2009. I ""upgraded"" last January when they threatened to cripple free's usability. And what did I get? It takes forever to load, and syncing is often unavailable. (Even then, the command to sync takes *four* clicks to activate in mobile. That's a lot.) I'll spend the last few weeks of ""Personal"" to copy my notes to another service. Evernote was once awesome. Now it's awful. I'm so disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be one of the best apps. Now a disaster! Desparately trying to sell the paid version while cutting out all the facilities provided in the free version. Don't intall unless you are going for the paid version. They will flood you with pop ups and unwanted ads. Disaster"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to work great but now there's so many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever,It okay to get advertisement while using app but here In advertisement I can find app.If you want to write anything just if u open app it lands in Play Store that badly made me to write a review.If we write 2lines we have to go through 2minutes add.Then have to download many apps just to write my content.Very bad experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy. Limiting the features one by one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"was awesome some years ago, got worse and worse with every update. content getting lost, slow in loading, annoying bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite note storing app. Simple, easy to use, ad free... it even greeted you in the homepage. Though I understand companies have to profit, but putting forced pop ups that permanently stay is not a way to treat loyal users who've been using the app for years. I cannot last 6 seconds until something comes up to not let me use the app. What is the meaning of this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a great App since 2015 when I started using it, until recently. Now unwanted pop up Apps would appear making the retrieval of my notes very difficult . Please leave the choice of apps to me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has deteriorating over time. Absolutely useless search function. Sync and loading takes extremely long. Half the notes don't load. Fix core functionility before introducing useless AI nonsense. Extremely dissappointed 10 year user. Will be shifting as soon as I can move my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So easy to use across devices. It really empowers organizing ideas, information, and tasks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Finally closed my account and uninstalling the app after 14 years of using it. Using the free version got more and more insufferable, and the last straw for me were the ridiculous unskippable 30 sec ads, especially the ones that force you to open another app. Screw that. Thanks for the few years y'all were actually useful, I guess? It's officially no longer worth the trouble."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a loyal, paying customer for over a decade, but had to cancel. Bending Spoons had taken one of my favorite apps of all time and turned it into a piece of absolute garbage. The mobile app is entirely unreliable, locking up every single time I have tried to search for a note. And yes, I tried clearing cache, clearing all data, and uninstalling and then reinstalling it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years. I would very much like to get my content back but it's locked out users. Do I have to pay for one month just to get my files back? What happens when you raise subscription prices again? Do we get locked out again and again?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Features are good, but pricing is becoming an issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"GREEDY"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works fine for me, never had any problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be free bit now $150 per year?! Not only, now you can only hold up to 50 notes. Ive deleted a few to make room and it still wont allow me to create new notes....I'll stick to pen and paper"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without giving any notice, They eliminated the free single device app, and I have lost access to all my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"really nice, I like it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience. Trying to copy some text from a note. My complete file that I save lock combos, door gates, several internet sites were just all lost. This program is garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update forces ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full screen video Ads ! Just for viewing text notes. Good app got spoiled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't use same account on 2 devices. Really evernote?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be good, but then they increased the price and now it is slower and delayed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First at 2015 when downloaded the app - it was so great, i was with the Evernote like forever - till today. From around 2020+ each time they added more and more limitations, like only ""x"" notes, or only one device. And now they added Ads. And this is it, il move on to another app that is with no ads and free - Evernote become greedy and annoying. Should see how its been like 9 years ago and learn how the app saposed to be and your greed ruined this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has fallen to deep monetization and is NOT usable anymore.. More and more pop ups are added. Unskippable ad on launch. Don't take it, many other options to choose from"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is now dead, and they don't allow you to export all your notes easily."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your stupid app has stopped working. Help me. I'm losing imp stuff"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is suddenly paid app done and ask to pay 2000 don't suggest before it is free my data is there but I has no money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just give one star it is not even for one star because I want to logout from this app and I cannot see any logout option I don't know why are there are apps from where we cannot log out I cannot see any option from here as I open this app I see that I have to pay money to use it they ask my email ID first and then as I see so they ask for money to pay I do not have any problem to pay but I cannot see any log out option how to logout from this app I don't understand this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No Longer a Recommended App and should not be a editors choice , Like others I used for a long time but now the increase in price and cut backs are driving me away hopefully someone else buys Evernote and makes it Great again MEGA."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"There seems to be an update every other day for the past 2 years and all it does is mess things up. I inquired about an issue with creating checklist and there answer was so complicated, for an app, that literally is made to do this. Now I can't leave a reminder on any task without the screen going white and closing the app out. I don't even want to ask for help at this point because it shouldn't be this complicated. Moving to another app, simple is better and this is no longer simple."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"sometimes does not sync. always gets conflict when app open on both devices. Re edit : had given 3 stars last year, now given according to the business centric approach of company rather than customer centric. It was a nice app once in past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Popping ads videos from nowhere. This is not just annoying but also hijacking my phone screen for seconds. It is outright breach of individual's rights. Better to switch to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a good one. But now with every document I access, I need to watch a gaming app add for minutes which is very annoying especially when it's urgent. I am iluninstalling this app. Hope the developers realise that customers feel pissed off if they are forced to watch adds and games to access important info from the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't think you should frustrate people into getting a paid plan, with multiple ads at a time, I just want a convenient place to store my information. But if that's too much to give then fine...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is so bothering what is wrong with this app. Everytime I open one of my notes it open lazada app. There is no way I can open my notes anymore. It's like you are forcing us to subscribe to your plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been using evernote for long time and it's improving periodically however the mobile version seems to crash ocasionally on my Pixel 6a"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They made in-app ads very persistent. I had to spent some time watching the ads before I can take a note. I am switching to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user for more than 5 years, had no complain when they try to limit device and limit the number of notes. The last straw is having pop up ads whenever I open it and it become irritating. The only pop up ads I encounter are game apps and it sounds ridiculous for a notepad. They have become unscrupulous like what the other reviews mentioned, extorting high premiums to be profitable. Shall migrate my notes before they locked my notes and ransom me for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Adds are not allowing to go back to the previous screen and need to force application to close."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No internet connection-no syncing This app constantly does not see an internet connection and will not sync. It's so unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They lost my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable now with ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The ads are getting ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It started showing video games ads just to read my notes. No longer interested in upgrading because of this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a paying subscriber, and after a decade of use, Im seriously getting to the end of my tether. Sooo buggy with images disappearing, can't upload images, text jumping around, not connecting to wifi or mobile data on my phone!! REALLY don't want to have to move everything, but becoming IMPOSSIBLE and UNUSABLE :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but I can no longer add notes, and I can no longer access my existing notes due to being inundated with forced ads and installs!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just updated the app on my tablet and having trouble log in with my gmail and password. The app looping on and keeps asking me to verify my login. I spent 5 mins try to get in and eventually had to login through mobile number. Horrible experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"thanks for adding stupid ads.. really needed that.... uninstalled 👊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"agree, please add alarm feature (multi alarm), and synchronizing with calendar update feb 2022: app crashes EACH TIME i use copy and paste to the note... dec 2024: recently got the premium service, but then the app getting buggy. often freezing when creating new note or saving clip from website.... terrible..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable unless paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had a free account for years. Now I can't even see my notes until I pay for their subscription plan. I can't click more than 3 times in the app without it popping up and blocking me further until I pay. How am I supposed to get to my notes I made years ago? Good grief."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had to sign in like 6 times, then it starts trying to ""personalize"" stuff, whatever that even means for a NOTE TAKING APP, and then it RELENTLESSLY started shoving a ""plan"" in my face like this is some kind of office tool used by corpos or something that requires being payed for. YOU ARE A NOTES APP FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ACT LIKE IT. No one wants to try to take notes, only to be constantly interrupted by garbage that makes it feel more like it's concerned with money and selling info than notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2012. It used to be one of my favorite note taking app. But now it is the most annoying app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Using for many years. Keep track of everything!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update to my 1 star review. Evernote keeps getting worse. They broke internal links. You can't navigate. They keep ignoring custo... Been using and paying for evernote for a decade now. The price has gone insane in the past 3 years: from $35/y to $70y/ and now $130/y. Since the acquisition of Evernote by Bending Spoons, this app has turned into a cash grab without any real new features, just basic language model AI tools, which you can get for free from google's gemini or chatgpt. Stay away!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote had been getting increasingly more insufferable for free users, with about a million pop-ups telling you to sign up for the paid version, and then in the past few months, a small ad appearing at the bottom of the screen, which was still almost tolerable. Today I click to open a note and am treated to an over 30sec unskippable Candy Crush ad. About to export more than 1k notes to Onenote tomorrow I guess"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this app many years ago until now. For now, it's a lot of advertisement and cannot skip it. Who want to use this app. Don't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"these pop up ad are very annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads sux uninstall soon if keep showing ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm moving to Joplin. Evernote had no Linux version. The web version is slow. It's totally overpriced. You did ask, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be the best note taking app, now it is full of promos, ads, it is crushing. The monetization implementation has not been executed with finesse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow on Android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dec 24: will stop using soon. a pity it had gone from bad to worse Jul 23: getting worse, will use another app. Tks Mar 23: too much promo. Apr 21 Terrible now. It was good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too many ads now .....app crash repeatedly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forces to watch full screen ads now, I'll switch to other apps, goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use this all the time. Now I can't even look at my notes since I have to pay a subscription to look at them. Can't create any either as well. 👎 Don't even bother using this, I will be uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since updates, still can't figure out how to change default font in notes, new or old. Also, Find in Note now defaults to first place you enter. If you want to go to a different ""Find"" location in a note, you have to exit that note and then reopen it. Still would like option of narrower line spacing. Finally paid for the app and updated it and then found that it changed the font on all my notes! Very annoyed. The line spacing is also farther apart."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After you introduced the ads for the free version, I changed to another notes app immediately. I was thinking of buying a paid version but after the ads, NO WAY, I will be using evernote ever again. You're a joke 😅"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to say that I used to be extremely satisfied with this app (I won't name it because the couple of years it began to stink. I'm very disappointed. To go from , ""great to ""stink"" is horrible, especially when the app management moved from Italy to California!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I can finally get it to load on internet, but it's 9 month old note content. Please fix these issues that began after I started using the pay service. It should get better, not worse when using the pay service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ew greedy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using Evernote for...10 years maybe longer? Only one I've ever liked. Used it for work, used it for home and hobbies, used it for a remodel, used it for starting a small/home biz. All around favorite. I have other similar apps of course (is it even possible to be online and not have certain ones? LOL) but I only use them for OS integrations/backups. Otherwise, it's Evernote for Everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"SUBSCRIPTION PRICING IS WAY TOO HIGH"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Mast"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Like many others have said, I used this app for years with no problems. Seems as though they're trying to cash in now - the true and tried way of being greedy scumbags. The ads popping up every other second are enough to drive you away. But then you raise the price to an insane amount? No wonder your users are leaving. Microsoft charges less and does it way better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for 6+ years for taking simple notes. However recently it has become outrageous. First Evernote blocked all my notes (not that many anyway) asking me to immediately remove desktop access (computer). Now it has become so pushy to buy their plan for $100+ a year??? Really Google Drive is free and you want that much money??! No bloody way you get from me. For the past 2 days every time I open my note, I have to fully watch 1 stupid advertisement, cannot close???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pay for a notepad app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used app for years but recently one app to use some of my data and copied it but data didn't copied and just got vanished due to app bug. I tried every possible way to recover it. Even subscribed to recover my data but unable to do so I lost my very important data even after paying it unable to recover it For years it way free and easy to use and safe for data but now a days it is unsafe for data storing as well as no relevant free version.App is bugy Paid version is over priced and useless too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible spamming of subscribing and now forced to watch 20s advertising. What's this rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Ignore the low ratings - these are for the free app. I've tried other similar apps but Evernote does exactly what I want and great synchronization across all my devices. Recent updates have solved some niggly issues and for me, this is the best Note taking app available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote for at least the past 6 years, and it has been a lifesaver in keeping all of the information I need easily accessible and available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please stop this nonsense. I have been a loyal user for decades but this is most likely the last straw. Roll back and stop showing invasive video ads or I'm uninstalling and migrating to other platforms. You were a market leader once, but no longer. I'm only staying for legacy reasons, but this video nonsense is the last straw. It has to stop or I'm leaving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for 10 years but it's nigh unusable now because of the ads and inability to make new notebooks. I will be uninstalling it. Shame!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great program, very versatile"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The old version was good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You want how much? I was told this app was recommended for one feature. One feature. Do I want to pay $170 every year for one feature? This subscription garbage needs to go. Used to be you could purchase software that you just owned,but now these companies extort money from you constantly. Make this make sense."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is up with the ads ???? Full screen Ads and no option to even cancel them??? I loved the app but this is driving me crazy now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't ever use this app. It hides all my Passwords, reminders and my notes of past 6 years, I used this app because it was good and free. Now they tell me to subscribe otherwise they don't show me my notes. Its very cheap and unfair behavior from developers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From great to worst. Riddled with ads that you cannot skip for half a minute. There are much better alternatives nowadays."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to use this app all the time for quick notes, book ideas, and other things, the ability to have all the organization on free with only a limited storage was great. But now since i have so many notebooks I can't edit any of them, or view them on more than 1 device at a time without a subscription. I haven't used it in over a year now, i was hoping they would have fixed their paywall but they haven't, it was beyond painful to even get my notes out as the export tool, use something else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update each open note forced to watch too over long length ads especially game and from best app to lousy app. Watch some short few seconds ads is fine since this is a free app. But forced to watch without close button for minutes definitely terrible annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is falling down rapidly. They limited it's use to one device. It is getting slower and now they are adding ads. What a story of failure, time to swtich to another more reliable app. Though thank you for your service for the past 2 years for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best notes app. Now the free version is not usable anymore. Worst choice of annoying unskippable ads. Literally seeing the demise of one of the best notes app. Sadly I will have to move on to Microsoft onenote or Google keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many advertisements which seem to run for too long. There's no timer on these ads as well. Will migrate to another app soon. This app is now a complete waste of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it. It's very intuitive and easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Italian company that bought out Evernote is slowly damaging what was an amazing product for many years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can not sync .. ""No connection.. You need an internet connection to sync""... Already connect but cannot sync.. Please fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an Evernote user for a decade. I loved the feature of being able to take a picture of something and add notes to make it searchable. Unfortunately, I had to start paying for the service in order to access the photos that I had taken years before. Even then, I lost some important pictures of keepsake information. Unwilling to continue paying for a glitchy, subpar app, I have finally divested myself of all association with this company. I strongly advise you look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pictures don't load/save files reappear afer being deleted Evernote takes forever on non Apple tablets"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote since 2012 and i have never been forced to pay for any of the free things associated with it. I log in and am given an option to pay. No way out. Fix this or i will transfer my years of information to another platform that will want my business when i am willing to pay. No response. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very good app. it has become cumbersome to just create a new note... it's necessary to specify the folder under which it will be created and, if you're not careful, you'll end up creating a new folder while creating the note... not very intuitive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So slow and laggy, I guess it's too much to ask for, for a note app? I'm gonna rewrite my notes to a physical notebook and uninstall this trash for good, Nothin' like the good ol' days!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now its so bad every note i open there an advertisement.. I once love evernote since but now i really hate it so bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unskippable video ADDS in a notes app. unfortunately cant give it less then one star. also very bad performance, even in ""offline"" mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"difficult to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loade Jaise application hai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, but now it is a completely pay service. There are too many free alternatives with more options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"cannot access my notes, when I open the app to access my notes a game starts and there is no option to stop it and move back, please fix this asap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app.using it since 2016."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years and now there's a cap on my notes if I don't give in to the relentless price gouging pop-ups? Keep your trashy subscription requests, I'll be finding a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying ads, too long, goodbye evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New student discount add has exit button (I'm not a student) where I can't access it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Spen does not work for sketch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after today's update it is no longer an app for notes but only a platform for unwanted ads which pop up on full screen..horrible..have not encountered a worse app !!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know who is responsible for this app's development and sales, but with all my respect, he is totally crazy. That advertising videos I saw today are the most stupid method to get money from users I have ever seen. Evernote has been a best app during years. But last two years it converted to totally useless software."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely shambles I would have given zero mark if I could,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly they are charging even for a single device and cant even go to notes no option to skip or minimize adverts.impossible to access notes now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote Free for years now. They're been gradually reducing the features available in the free version and, now, only one device can be used. That's an absurd and I'm migrating to Notion, which is much better. Thanks, Evernote tram, for the incentive to spend some time exporting my notes and importing them to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You know why"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notes are locked behind a pay wall. That is evil..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A fascinating case of making an app worse with every update. Now I can't add a note from status bar anymore. Can't select more than 100 notes for exporting. Can't open links (!!!) The web app logs you out randomly, even in the middle of editing notes. And on top of that this ""productivity software"" is bombarding users with popups. Of course, closing endless useless notifications helps my productivity a lot (/s) They force users to read their newsletters and ignore the letters addressed to them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I try to unsync all my devices except my phone it locks me out insist that I sign up for a paid version. Used to be a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quality and speed have degraded with each update. I've been using Evernote since 2011, and have used the paid for version on many occasions. However, the price now is ridiculous, given that it's much slower and more awkward to use. More taps needed to get where you want, and then having to just wait ages until the note eventually opens is really irritating for any app, never mind one that costs this much. It used to be brilliant, but it's gone downhill, and I'm now looking at other options. Sad!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I work for russia."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great and I used it a lot. Now it's holding all my notes hostage as every feature doesn't work due to me not paying for it. I can't possibly use any of it, even the actually important ones, because they just kept taking features away. Now they're forcing me to delete delete delete before I can even view them. It's a worthless frustration that I hope I can extract my work from. Go find a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid this app, you can now only have (1) Notebook with a max of 50 notes on the free tier. Guess who reached the limit as a user thats be using this app since these guys began. Instead of making an Ad based tier with small banner ads for the free version so they can keep the features we have been using for years evernote has taken everything little by little till doing this now & locked longtime users out after reaching the 50 notes or pay them $$$ a year"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Invasivo el publicidad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dropping from four stars to one due to the upcoming price hike. I had no problem paying $35/year for the personal plan to have access on my phone, tablet and we browser and the app iself is good but jacking the price to $130/year is outrageous. The personal plan will include unlimited devices but I don't care about that. They effectively wiped out the good mid-tier plan as you now have to use the Free plan with only one device or Personal with unlimited, nothing in between."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"You get to a point where you have to invest into a tool to accomplish organization. Been a subscriber for over a year now and I haven't looked back. You can definitely tell that there is investment in developing a better app and experience. It is crazy how much further this app is in just a year. Really looking forward to this next year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting access on devices pretty much ended the usefulness of it. Not what it was in 2011. Not worth the $"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"If you like making lists this is a no-brainer. Syncs with all my devices. Update: Gouged and fleeced. Been using for probably 10+ years. Latest price increase is almost double. Another example of vendor lock-in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Does almost everything that I need it to do that I can find things that I want to remember. I just wish it would remember where I put things in the house.😉"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I saw that Google Play refunded me a subscription of $16.53 which I never ordered. I used to use the free version but was locked out and never able to retrieve my notes. This was a waste of my time to track this down on Google Play. I hope they are done making fraudulent charges on my Google Play."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely slow, both startup and usage. The free version is practically un-usable with the number of times they show adds for the paid version and the number of clicks required to bypass it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even log in at the singup stage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to uninstall Evernote from the Playstore but refuses to leave. I now have 2 options only : Open and Update and no longer an ininstall button. Not happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is quite slow making it virtually inaccesable to get to places.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I am unable to convert hand written note to typed one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"EN is still unique in what it offers, the roadmap looks promising, bugs are becoming fewer. I don't see an alternative to EN, tried and checked some alternatives, but EN is still unrivaled. Scratch Pad is a fantastic complement to the task planner. EN must get the rating in the Playstore under control, because I don't see it surviving with a 2.X rating. The solution might be to create 2 apps: one for paying subscribers only, which I expect to receive a better ratings and one for freeloaders..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"An absolute nightmare to sign in to on mobile. Every time I change contexts to the password manager it clears the login screen. I hate this trash app. It constantly spams me with its stupid ai tools."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"without my permission nor my interaction, this app exploited me being a previous customer to setup an auto subscription I discovered today, thru Google play, on my alternate Google account I use for my calendar. I used this app faithfully for many years; it was a decent note taker. Then the interface became too complicated, +screens to access notes. Then it took to long to access notes.it locks notes for sub. I had subbed temporarily and canceled. It used my info to sub me without my input."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Help my small business and life work flow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I bought this app 10 years ago with lifetime subscription. Then they changed me to ""free"" monthly user and restricted everything. You've earned your bad ratings."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I liked the old layout better. easier access to your favorite documents"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best note taking app, been using it for years it get's better each year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am experiencing lagging on xiomi tablet ,is problem on my side. We tried on ipad too ,the same exists.please look into it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I feel like I wasted my time downloading this app, sorry for this comment but the thing is I created my account then I logged in and every time it's only showing me the login screen over and over even after logging in it's the same thing.😞. Just annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What an absolute disgrace of an app. Absolutely extortionate subscription. Tuned users into using the app then began popping ads. Hijacking the notes of common people. Slowly adding more and more restrictions. Don't install this app unless you are a millionaire"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used this app for years with only an occasional glitch or two. That is, until my phone died recently. I am unable to sign in on my new phone because I used an old email address that is no longer available to me. I don't know how to recover it; I've lost over ten years of notes and writing. I should have updated my account, but I just didn't think about it. Before this, I would have rated this app five stars. Right now, I'm heartbroken."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Same thing as all the other 1 star reviews."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't see my old note without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It Stolen my data and now force me to access my data by pay certain amount"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing couldn't live without it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Changing my review, because when I opened it after long time It's become unusable, i just opened to paste single note and now it's impossible. Asking me to delete stuff continuously, severe limitations for such poor experience, i couldn't delete after trying. Poor experience, UI is very very slow. So just uninstalled. I will stick with Google Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The UI is extremely counter-intuitive, and you're under a constant looming pop up for an over 200$ a year subscription plan any time you miss-tap a button onto one of the paid features. Which really now seems like most of them from what I saw. There isn't any way to sort things into separated ""journals"" without paying. Can't put everything into one 50 note folder ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nice app until allow just one device synced."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally slooooow... It takes 20-40 sec to open and start making note. Even more to search through notes. It turned BS after upgrades, no one needs those bunch of features. Return simplicity, hey devs!! Probably its time 2 switch for other app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"totally disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"dead app already. no new features are being added. catch up to notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it acts up often and not even saving my audio that I'm going to transcript."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Read the Terms of Service. They listen to your phone calls and a bunch of other weird stuff if you download and use their app. Plus it's nearly impossible to get your data from them. Be careful!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app to organize/manages notes. Pls drop the fixes splash window which is very frequent andannoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be pretty good. Then they made it impossible to sync multiple devices. Might as well migrate elsewhere. One Note is pretty good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you're not paying for it then don't bother. Surprised how quickly they killed their business. If you do pay, it's probably great but definitely other free options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become greedy hog, it was good in initial days but I hope there is downfall to everything Evernote now, it's quickly losing good free features and going fully paid service to monetize as much it can"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now horrendous. One star is generous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be a good app before all the fancy upgrades now they want a monthly fee.. the evil green has taken control.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It can decifer my hand righting unlike other apps and really use full in a time crunch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full screen ads? 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm Disappointed and Frustrated I've been a loyal user of Evernote for years, relying on it across all my devices for my daily notes. However, the recent influx of intrusive ads and the pushy subscription model have completely soured my experience. It's incredibly frustrating to be bombarded with ads every few minutes, interrupting my workflow. I'm seriously considering switching to a different note-taking app that respects its users and doesn't prioritize profit over user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be something. I left today 27/11/24. Keep farming ads like you're some crazy telegram shitcoin. You deserve no stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"0 stars. Do not recommend. You can't access the notes you've already created unless you subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable due to constant subscription ads. Every action brings up another one begging for your money. There are many better free note apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Advertisements for a note taking app, really?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very much expensive and no security. I changed my password several times but still I get message that account login detected in XYX country."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Almost every time the app updates, the biometrics to open the app stop working plus its impossible to contact the creators unless you're a computer whizz and you can download your log, like YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE APP NOT WIRKING UNLESS YOU'RE A SOFTWARE PROGRAMMER. don't download the app if you're not a software engineer, you'll be trapped paying for and using a service that doesn't care about you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"sometimes when i have no internet connection i can't write on my scratch pad -.-"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app free for years, now without warning I can't access any of my notes without paying, it's just a note app it's not worth £80 a year get a grip"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much notification for subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My go-to Note app since 2010. Loved it. Now it went from free to a ridiculous 14.99 USD per month. Many more apps blow this sway for free Do not spend your money. Use the notes app that came with your device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I want to cancel my subscription. How do I about doing that?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New: My notes have now been stolen and held for ransom. Previous: I, again, can't add shortcuts to my home screen. Previous: I can add shortcuts to my screen. However, I can't see all the notes under my tags. Again, fix this issue and stop stealing my notes. Previous: This app keeps getting worse. Now I can't add shortcuts on my home screen. I also can't view all of my images. You are stealing my content. Previous: I liked the app until now. The new limitation of devices is disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They somehow managed to force a yearly subscription on me, that I never willingly agreed to. Probably a popup at the wrong time, and tadaa you've subscribed. I now have a year time to find something better. 100€ wasted. Spare yourself that lesson."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Always available and secure,!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be such a great app. I loved it. But in the past couple years... absolute fall from grace. First forcing subscriptions and now it just crashes constantly, not to mention the UI upgrade is just terrible, clunky, awkward... such a shame . And now it won't load any of my media at all. Keeps getting worse!! Amazing job guys 👌👌👌👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible....I understand that the free version have free ad. What is frustrating is that even after a long time the ad can't be turned off..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I kept having to watch at least 5 advertisement before I can open Evernote. Which never happen before and it never happen to my family who have their own Evernote account. This is getting annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very stupid and frustrating app. It cannot allow you sign up, keep going around in circles so frustrating, same thing with their online site Take this thing down or fix your log in and sign up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reducing from 2 free synced devices to one and jacking up the price, while still being very buggy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is driving me crazy with ads and premium subscription prompt. They are weeding out free users so off I am leaving this useless app with the poorest UI etc. Such a shame. Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it keeps crushing! I open to make a note, and then it just shuts down!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best app to keep your notes...i love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cheap strategies At first they will let you believe that the app is free for personal use and after a few months all of sudden you will no longer get access to anything until you pay... SCAM"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great oe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads, the devs are really hungry at this point"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm very disappointed that in their fervor to get my money, they have chosen to hold my old notes hostage until I pay their exorbitant prices for a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be truly phenomenal. Now it sucks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. But the full screen ads are now invasive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited function offline is the last straw. Why does it take 2 sec to open a empty text note? Tooo much flashy function as a simple notebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app held my notes ransom without any option to not pay for it, or any way to safely transfer those notes in a zipped file or otherwise. Actively shameful, malicious, and reprehensible business practices on display."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Early on, I loved this, and it was great to share notes with my wife and across multiple devices (android, iOS, PC), and creating notes from email. Search within pictures was great when it wasn't a standard Google feature. I even thought it was worth paying for. But now you get much less for free, it is much slower, and the price is many times what it started at. And some things like the PDF viewer feel clunky (no selection for cut and paste!?!). So I'm annoyed my subscription renewed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"⭐🌟⭐🌟⭐🌟 FYI – I wasn’t prompted to rate the app.. after Bending Spoons acquisition of Evernote with scepticism and all.. the improvements and work being done reminds me why I originally loved Evernote, honestly it deserves a 6 star rating! To the team – Thank you, you doing a great job!! 🙏🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a member since 2012. I use Evernote for recipes. I am unable to access them because Evernote wants me to pay for it. Twelves years ago it was free to use. Now I can't access any of my recipes. That is not right. Evernote should make it right by allowing me to access recipes I put in before payment was required. I normally would not put this in a review."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A nice app but lately have been stressing, its introducing me to anxiety cause all of a sudden the app is not conducive for my device again, failed to update or even sync my data to my cloud storage pathetic. Tried all I could even sent a mail now response. So when I get a new device and login not all my data would reflect cause not all was updated. You see how stup!d your Devs are?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage had the app.Now I can't see any of my notes.Because now it's changed.They want money.I can't even see the notes I made"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pathetic attempt at money a grab, i had this app for more than 5 years with over 600notes, they cap a 600 limit and are forcing me to pay to get access to my notes again. Where is the consideration for the loyalty. I contacted them multiple times to remove this glitch as it prevents me from making any changes to the amount of notes i have, and they never get back, Only wait for you to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Edit: now they're doubling the price?? I make lists on this app, it has no AI features and it's going to be $129 a year?? I'll never understand why developers take a good product and just ruin it. Even the search feature doesn't work anymore. Some of my notes are gone. They're not organized right anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good bye Evernote, you're getting expensive. I'm moving out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for years togather, but now it's subscription has got paid. And in free version lots of advertisements are there, so now shifted to other similar applications."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Note taking is easy. Difficult to use with free account, repeated loops trying to get me to upgrade and won't let me just take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App became extremely aggressive with monetisation. You cannot have more than one device synced anymore. Anti-consumer behaviour that makes the app useless. Literally every click triggers a 'subscribe now' pop-up with the option to dismiss it hidden really well. Also it's impossible to log in now. I'm being asked for a 2fa code to log in. When I switch to the authenticator app the state resets and you can't put the code in anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads, need money, want money, keep pop up for subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app till the absurd restrictions on free tier. It's fine to push for paid plans but not being able to freely edit or export existing notes/ notebooks is completely unacceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last time was awesome. Now, there are annoying un-skippable ads. Gonna migrate my notes and uninstall this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This went from the best note taking apps to pure garbage. In addition, I have been a paid user for way over 10 years. Up until now I was charged a reasonable $35-ish per year. Next year they want to bring it up to over $100. Bye bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am ok with the recent advertisement BUT there is no clear message saying how long I should wait for its display and also the App keep me jumping in and out several times for the advertisement, making the overall usage experience dropped to the lowest level for this App. IT should improve the web flow design on how to display those advertisement in which it will not downgrade the overall usage experience. Believe there is system bug or not enough testing after adding those new advertisement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not the app I started with years ago. Every blooming time there's this popup to subscribe and now ads just interupts me while on a note. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm so sad I'll be screenshotting all of my recipes and no longer using this app. I'm not paying a monthly fee. I literally open the app once a year. You have made it nearly impossible to use this app without being asked /tricked into paying to use it. Rediculous. We are over paying subscriptions for everything. There has to be a better way. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm nt happy, I lost some of the voice note I saved. some culd not download"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love Evernote but PLEASE fix note sharing. It's so buggy, asking ppl to log in and pay subscriptions just to view a note. Reported this several times but no fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst App Everytime popup comes for asking for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry to say bye2 to this app. Its totally business app. Just trailer for free & without premium ( more expensive than Netflix) u cannot use it. Dear users, u will find such facilities on ""Google keep"" at free of cost. I am shifting to ""google keep"" & bye2 to this commercial app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's getting too much annoying ads that I can't skip. The apps used to be great, but now I'm going to uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fun way to share notes and build collaboration"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have Been a user since 2015 and it Used to be great! But now the app coerce you to upgrade and watch 1 minute adds in order to just see your notes. Honestly the became unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app all important stuff in one place"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is a powerhouse of note taking and related functionalities. With the addition of reminders it tries to take on the reminders and to do game as well. With all these functions it looses out on quickness and presentation. The app size has increased and effectively it has marred the performance. Just a simple opening of note takes much time. This is definitely above average application, but considering the UI and performance, has few troubling spots. Edit: culled syncing. Rating goes to 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enough is enough Dozens of updates but issues is still on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just put price up from R109 to R719. Moved to Samsung notes. Goodbye and....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great scam. Used to have ton of features for my notes now i basically emptied my account. M moving to good old simple Google keep. Greed has no limits. Give great product for free, lure users and then lock them out of their files and stick a bill on their face. I wouldn't come back to evernote even if the subscription is free or something in near future. Please don't fall for any black friday deals from evernote even if there are in near future. If only companies were more human than biz"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No more free, bye2 Evernote. Thks for previous free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"slow and difficult to use application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be great-- I had loads of notes from the free version, then they changed their pricing structure, charged exorbitant fees, and COMPLETELY LOCKED ME OUT OF MY OLD NOTES until I paid. now I have to find a way to download hundreds of notes before I can cancel. and they have the audacity to ask me for a review? hilarious. I've been using ""one note"" (no space) since this happened and it's way, way better (and doesn't try to upsell me or lock me out every time I open the app)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote keeps me organized and updated.. truly enjoy the app"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"day by day the app becoming very worst. why? why it getting slow. it becoming worst with every new update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote suddenly logged out me by itself. I updated it and still it's not allowing me to login showing error msg...Pls help.. This is ridiculous..I need urgent help in logging back... there is no way to get support... there is no help or support link anywhere on internet too... i m feeling very frustrated.. where to complain.. are you listening Evernote? atleast provide link to register complain about the issue.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Known, long-standing android issues that break bulleted & numbered lists (force stops text input) and character formatting (re-toggles bold/underline/italic). You know, basic note functions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for ten years, the recent change is ridiculous, I don't mind now you can use it in one device only and there is a abv banner at bottom but force me to watch 30 second ads before I can start drop my notes, it is unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"removing all notes from this app. Locking all notes behind paywall and ads. Scum"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Jest trochę lepiej nież było. Aplikacja nadal działa wolno, ale przynajmniej nie trzba czekać sekund na reakcję. Przewijanie zaczęło działać płynnie. Poprawiono interfejs i nie ma już problemu z przesłanianiem notatek czy problemem z cofaniem się gestami. Chciałbym jednak, żeby popracowano nad wydajnością. Mała notatka nie może wczytywać się przez ponad sekundę."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This WAS a great app. I attempted to log in after being idle for a while. All of the notes I had made were behind a pay wall! What a terrible business practice. I will not be doing business with them again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once great... Now unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of pop-ups and limitations makes it unusable. It used to be my favourite but they're on that 'everything needs to be a subscription' mindset, and their subscription is expensive. The popup wouldn't go away until I force closed the app or bought it. Press and hold doesn't work, so the only way I can see to delete notes is to click them one by one, click the menu, and press move to trash, which is untenable. I give up, it can keep them (pun intended, as I've moved to Google Keep)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot even use my everynote now. It won't let me pay the subscription page that pops up. I only use 1 phone at a time. This is ridiculous I have been using Evernote since it came out years ago I am so disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved the free version, opcion the payment, i wish it would be possible to buy the app not paying monthly or per year, now, adds are so invasive, cant even open my note, i am just switching to some more simple but efficient, Keep Notes or Samsung Notes, thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Finally after so many years, evernote is now very poor....now Leaving Evernote and heading towards ColorNote.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it organizes everything for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very worst app. Iam using since 10 years, now not able to open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Hadn't used it much for years but decided to subscribe for a year because of a half price offer. Glad I did as I've been very impressed over the past nine months. Love the uncluttered new interface. Essential functionality for me are the web clipper and the handwriting transcription which is superb. I haven't had operational problems except when transcription stopped working - I raised a ticket and it was fixed in 48 hours. Also use the PC app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My most hated app ever since they FORCE you to watch a 30 second video ad for a fake mobile game every time you open the app! So disgusted that I will be deleting this at the first opportunity. Save yourself the pain and DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: Downgrading to 1 star You'll be out of market soon. With all that you stood for, I actually thought I had found an app that'll last as one of my favourites. Used it for a decade, It had it all. And now what you're doing to your loyal users is just pathetic. With these strategies, you think you can make people buy premium. You're wrong. Your very existence will vanish from the face of the Earth. Good luck and Good bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"By increasing prices ridiculously while simultaneously removing functionality Evernote has now lost me as a customer! I used Evernote as a painless way of passing info between my computers, tablets and phones. Well the love affair is officially over, paying their now truly extortionate fees to retrieve my data is not going to happen so goodbye Evernote, I don't wish you well and truly hope your business fails!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing before the update, now things are in diffirent fonts, sizes, and things are much much harder to copy and paste on mobile Edit: the new update competrly changed the layout and made it much worse overall. Just stop updating. It's like discord updated. EDIT: NOW YOU CAN ONLY USE EVERNOTE ON 1 DEVICE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH WASTE OF SPACE APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today after 13 years, I will delete Evernote due to your constant harassment to buy the premium service. The reason I don't do it is that I use it very little (1-2 notes a month as a reminder), but today it just won't let me create notes anymore, supposedly because they are limited to 50 for free users (I have 22) and if I don't pay, I can't make a new one... See you never."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is worthless. You're better off just using a pen and paper if you want to have access to your notes. Countless times I've made changes to a note that haven't saved or got 2 copys of the same note created. Update: They are now holding my notes hostage and trying to extort me into getting a subscription to access my notes that I made before the stupid 50 note limit was put in place. I can't even view them in order to move to a new note app. This company should be investigated by the FTC"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since the advertising it's been glitchy and really unreliable. Enough for me to change apps. I have been using this app since I want to say 2011."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is still my go-to note app but I don't like it nearly as much as I used to. Web clips aren't as good, organization isn't as user friendly. Password reset didn't work at first and was a real pain."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't log in and sign in with any device. I tried it with Google and Apple accounts. You are awful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How do I cancel and get a refund, I never agreed to a paid subscription? Evernote just started billing me and I cannot find any way to cancel!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The widget says no content to display. Broken i think"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Costumava ser o melhor aplicativo de notas. Usava pelo telefone e pelo computador, mas agora se tornou impraticável a versão gratuita e o preço da versão paga é inviável. Uma lástima, mas há muitas opções na loja de aplicativos."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"There is no way to do an immediate search from the home screen. It takes many steps to find anything. App is still laggy and glitchy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WoW... Video Ad right after opening the app with loud sound explaining about Kamasutra book from kukufm"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"awful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Despite having an account since 2012. I lost all my data, everything, after the company was sold.... I still have my original password. So be careful here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using this app from the last 8 yeras. Since the last update has become rid with video ads. I'm changing to another note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this apps from 2017, it's been a really great application. But I think it's time to say good bye. Since the recent updates, which need to pay for notes, i was unable to write any notes at all saying i reach the limits. Just keeps this until now, becauae it's has a lot of notes and memory inside. So bye, will uninstall it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why is the app so sluggish to open ? Recently took subscription Not happy !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"**Update: November 2024** Back to 1 star. The company continuously adds features that are unnecessary and not wanted, without addressing major ongoing problems. Since October 2023, the app has been constantly crashing. Their customer support only directs you to the FAQ section and offers no real assistance, which shows a lack of response to usability complaints. May 2024, New owners see interesting backstory if you Google them. They have an interesting story of you googie them. 1 Star again 24."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version of app basically unusable due to restrictions on number of notes and constant intrusive ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling. too many ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost my little notes when ended try period"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never seen an app so desperately asking for a subscription after a few seconds. Full of ads and repeated subscriptions. Looks like they are about to go bankrupt! Transfer your data before it's too late. This app is shi*."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"(edit - Finally improving. Now 3 stars) Why do you keep screwing this app?!!!! Too many cooks in the kitchen? This used to be a 5 star app and now dropped to 1 star. Every update brings a new set of problems. I am a paying customer who will be transitioning to a rival."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be solid but now scummy practices, unrealistic pricing, and really annoying screens about how you can never get an offer again every single time you open the app. It's that pathetic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I kept my important notes there when this app was free, but one day it was just suddenly locked! And I can't get my notes unless I pay for at least a month (17$!!). This is shocking and so rude, especially when you have so many other free apps for keeping notes. Do not recommend!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. But no longer is a great app or service. Moved to another notes organizer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I always had the 2 device free plan. Now this junk stopped working! Every time it tells me that I need to remove my desktop device in order to use my mobile! And the desktop keeps spamming me with upgrade ads CONTINUOUSLY!!! Time to look for a better solution!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now I can't even access old notes or just scroll around without paying? This is crazy. So now everything I've written and trusted Evernote with us in the garbage because there's no way I'm paying for an app that does this to loyal users of years. Very dissapointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The subscribe price from $20-$30 to $90+ ... and its every year. This is more expensive than any other note apps!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super functional, helps us stay organized."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Effectively impossible to use two-factor authentication on the app because, when you shift to Google Authenticator to get the code, Evernote bumps you out of your current login attempt. And this is with a newly paid account. Just a ridiculous problem for a well established and very expensive platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible amount of pop ups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After signing up to use the app I can't even Log in to use it! Keeps taking me back to the screen to sign in! How the hell am I supposed to even use the app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Omg this app is horrible. It used to be free right. So I wrote all my poetry and short stories via Evernote. Now I cannot access any of my poems or stories. If you are a writer I'm sure you understand my frustration. I'll be contacting them and maybe they'll grant access so I can atleast get all my material off.of there app. I used to love this app but I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND USING EVERNOTE."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been working all day to find a way to download my notes. I finally came across a review that said I cannot use the web version to download--I have to use the app. So I have to export to Google drive or something like that, then if I want my notes on my computer, I have to save them from Drive? There is no export button on the Webb version, i have taken a lot of notes in Evernote and now I have to go to all this work to save them? I am not very happy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cancelled and now I can't get into the app even though I have a week left on my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years but recently its become unusable with how many UPGRADE THIS UPGRADE THAT YOU REACHED THE LIMIT MF NAH U REACHED MY LIMIT. uninstalled hope this reaches y'all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want to upgrade. And I cannot get to the notes that I have already made. So frustrating! If I don't want to upgrade, my past notes should not be held hostage!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Capitalism have ruined this application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Outstanding upgrades, which caused me to come back. The price is worth it and am loving the commitment to continuous improvement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app can easily be hacked. And, all your documents can be accessed. I have a history of who all accessed my documents from different IP addresses. Stay away from this app. Earlier it used to be very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am extremely frustrated with Evernote. The app took forever to load while I was trying to log in, and it made the whole experience so frustrating. I expected better performance from an app I used regularly back then, but this constant lag is just unacceptable. I hope they fix this issue soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No so bad so far. I like it an use it before... very strange application for today. just want to get your money. very slowly running doesn't matter how fast and powerful your device! No possibility to export if you not using desktop or notebook. Hey, owner and developer, are you frying in last century sky and never come back to real? You completely loose your face and name! Give you up, bye bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is not opening,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Years' worth of notes are no longer available. I can't even see anything on my account unless I pay for, that was previously free unless I pay 14.99 for the month or 77.99 for the year. That's absolutely insane. Definitely would not recommend this app to anyone! Do not waste your time or money!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"scammy. Avoid at all costs. This company is holding our old notes hostage. been using evernote for a decade or so...To avoid this company here are better options. Onenote, Keep, even Post-it is better. Evernote is scammy. AVOID AVOID AVOID"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great Notes App. Use it daily."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gets worse with every update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One synced device on the free plan. What a JOKE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using Evernote for quite long time, suddenly when I tried to open to see some notes I had message: limit reached! Evernote blocked me so I could not get access to any notes any more unless subscription is paid. If limit is reached I would understand not to allow me to make new notes but to block access to existing notes I don't believe is correct and even legal? Will write to Google to clarify this. After everything 1 star is to good as review!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go-to note taking app, but everything is behind a paywall now, so unfortunately I'll be uninstalling and finding something else that doesn't cost so much to just jot down notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Mala"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible course of events, after the app got acquired by bending spoons. Lots of Ads, and still the notes are limited. Ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pop up with out closure option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Thanks for giving us the ability to select the default opening screen! Now give us back TWO DEVICE SYNC !!! So i guess the free version is no longer syncing with a second device... Poor choice for anyone who wants an ""ok"" note pad that will sync with two devices for free. Still looking elsewhere for a notepad app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once used this app avidly. Then it became a total wasteland of technological trash with numerous glitches & hiccups. Can't even access my data that is years & years old so I can delete it. Just an incessant screen of ""Pay up"". No thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not work on Chromebooks. Haven't been able to log in for over a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Tp ga tau 99.8 nya juga yahhu 65 aku"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2016. The app jumped on the subscription bandwagon and has chipped away all features to pressure users to pay high subscription fees. Plus, I could barely move between screens within the app without a pop-up ad encouraging me to subscribe, and canceling out of the pop-up became more difficult to do. I got tired of it, so I cleared out my notes, canceled my account (and ordeal in of itself), and deleted it off my devices. Good riddance!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless now. Can only sync to one app, unless you pay extra. Continually removes features that used to be free. Much better apps around."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is disgusting now. Can anyone recommend me usable app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. Now it won't even let me look at past notes without requesting an insanely expensive plan. Do not recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A fabulous resource. Really useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The product has improved much and is a much better utility"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing to pay for subscription. Now even in offline notes, i cant see my important notes. Too bad.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"did you guys just locked out all free user of their years of notes? you guys need to be sued.. and unskippable forced ads on a NOTEBOOK APP? ARE YOU GUYS NUTS??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Outrageously priced for what it does. With time it actually got worse. There are better apps that are less or free, to include Google Keep Notes witch is what I use, now that I can lock the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is just shooting themselves in the foot. Went from one of the best notes app, on par with OneNote to a joke of non functionality, limitations and stupid prices. If you're still using this app, start migrating to another service (OneNote or Notion or similar) and stay away from this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I just use it for GTD and they keep adding totally unnecessary stuff that makes it more challenging. I'm probably just too old and lame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for taking notes and keeping it easy to access"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Glad to see in the update videos that major improvement is coming, it offsets the price increase. This is simply the best tool for storing many kinds of information from photos to spreadsheets it takes them all!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Impossible to use now without being bombarded with modals and popups trying to get you to subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got reward"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used to be great, now not so much. the new owner messed it up. I paid for the subscription to get access to 3 devices, but now they won't support my tablet. also now really slow to load. 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No sync between app and desktop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best note app. Was easy, fast, simple, and accessible everywhere. Now if you don't pay them an outrageous reoccurring fee the app is unusable. Even getting my stuff out of evernote was a pain because they throw up splash screens asking you to subscribe every 3 seconds. Way to ruin a nice thing guys. There are so many better, free note apps. You don't need this and you shouldn't reward their greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even get to the page to make an account, let alone use the app itself. What is with the developer obsession with having to make accounts just to take notes? This is the second app I've tried that makes you sift through ToS and login pages just to access them! Make an app that you open and take notes with; that's it. No logins, no nebulous data collection, nothing. Let me open it and start typing ffs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app from almost the very beginning and then tried new shiny apps. When I have returned to give it another go, it will not even let me view my own notes! You have to subscribe to see them. A 7-30 day trial to see if it was back as the note capture tool for me, may well have resulted in me paying the annual premium, but to not even let me view my own content is a major red flag for me. Come on Evernote are you really so desperate to force subscriptions this way?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you are not planning to purchase a premium plan, do not install this app. The ads will kill your patience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I LOVE Evernote! Couldn't live without it! Helps keep me organized. Great app! I recommend it to everyone!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be really good, but now it's extremely laggy. The free version has an annoying amount of ads and it takes me a few minutes to gain access to my notes because ads just pop up and i can't even close them. 10/10 would not recommend to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Functionality is good. Speed is very bad. It is so slow that i pick other apps instead when i wanna something jot down. Pathetic..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app...dont work if u r not a premium user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could rate this app as 0 stars, I would. I can't access my previously free notes unless I pay like $130 per year. Are you kidding me? Garbage....do not use this app! I used it for many years and loved it. I'm done. I can't access anything that I've created. My notes are being held hostage. DO NOT use this app....stay away! Update: The random Evernote support messages stating that you're sorry and would like to investigate the issue further is a complete joke! You know what you did!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My GOTO DAILY JOURNAL AND RECIPE SAVER."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't choose 0 stars :(My data is held hostage.. I took notes using the free version a long time ago, now I can't even open the app. Don't download, boycott Evernote! Never been so frustrated with an app. Gladly will change to 4 stars if I can use a free very basic version with ads but most importantly access my old notes (my intellectual property), which are really extensive.... But I doubt it'll change, so just don't download it. Evernote owner: prove me wrong or continue disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible: I have put notes into Evernote for years and now trying to download them is Extraorrdinarily tedious. WHAT HAPPENED?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"starting to get bloated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems totally disgusting, too much ads for non premium customer, premium cost is also too much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app before. Now not only it's limited to one device at a time but it's heavily infested with ads. I'm switching over to Google Note instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a truly awful app. This used to be the go to note taking app a long time ago now it is garbage. Whoever purchased this app destroyed it. They have stripped away most features and the app is full of endless popups to upgrade your plan. Deleting this trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be usefull with two device syncing, but they removed that and now are limiting the free plan to 50 notes max... without the sync it was already doomed but now I'll just switch back to samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really great app. I use to store bhajan in my phone. Aap ka data secure rahta hai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE 2024 November : used this more than a decade. NOW HORRIBLE. with never ending coercion to subscribe to 'plans' everytime i open the app. Might be forgiven for their own survival. But what explains lost notes? Cant open my note for 1 week already - always ""note unavailable. Unable to load this note, please try again later"" UNRELIABLE. gonna copy my notes and save elsewhere and tara! Goodbye. You won't be missed. Old review : Easy to save. And sync. Used for many years, still using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable. You’ve blocked my access to my own notes—essential information like passwords and bank details—behind an upgrade paywall? Are you seriously holding my critical data hostage and making me pay to get it back? Even if I wanted to upgrade, I can’t, because you’ve locked me out of everything. This is an outrageous breach of trust and utterly unacceptable. Choosing Evernote was a colossal mistake!!! 😤"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app, Now can't retrieve my info"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just can't understand why a simple notes app is so expensive? They've increased in price so much since I started using it and now I have to transfer so many of my notes and scribbles because it's just so ridiculously pricey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads and keep forcing us to subscribe. Even just read our notes we must to watch silly ads like 10-15 second. Uninstall now. Thanks for everything 🥳🥳"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. Useless, requires money. My notepad is much cheaper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APP! USE GOOGLE KEEP instead, it's a decent, free alternative. Evernote WAS wonderful and FREE to make many notes and notebooks. NOW THEY CHARGE you a crazy high price, $120/yr, to have any decent functionality out of the app, like to make more than one notebook and many notes. I've used Evernote since 2012 and have TONS of notes and notebooks, but FK that. This app will go extinct soon. I just need to find a way to transfer all my stuff to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"My everote was perfect but after updating it ,I cant reach any of my notes. Every time i open the app,it start for a second and then it stop and turn to a blanck white page.I cant use it any more. My phone is samsung S9"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It sucks. Didntn know it was going to time ot and I'd have to pay. It won't let me get my information off it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total rubbish that forces you to pay. I Google searched for a site to take text from an image, I tried Evernote via chrome but it forced me to install the app which I did. I opened it and signed in and then it started trying to force me to take a subscription, I canceled that and tried to open the image I wanted to take text from and once again it tries to force me I to a subscription, I canceled that and finally clicked the button to get text and it can't do it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No matter which platform do I use — app became complete garbage. 8+ years user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was my favourite app .not any more. Uninstalled it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's a good app to make notes but for some reason despises images. I've has to remove and replace images multiple times because the app claims they're from an external source. I don't place images from external sources and it's getting very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It just... Works. Easy to use. Notebook interface is a little complicated to use. EDIT: Now I have to pay for my notes?! Yeah, no. See ya."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scam Service!!! They dont allow you to get your notes before you pay them money!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started good but now its going downhill"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A once superb app that has been ruined. Please revert to a version that is quick and easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"pay more for less. long time evernote user, and am deeply saddened to see how little you get for your basic subscription now days. you're better off storing and organizing your notes elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Wish you would fix Arabic Writing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went from the best note app to being a money sucking machine. A typical transition when people running a business realize they have free will and can stop serving the community and simply serve themselves. The free plan is unusable. The paid plan is slow, clunky, and buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really? I've just updated it and not only all my notes are gone but I'm being forced to subscribe. As soon as I'm recovering my notes I will uninstall and block for payments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was previously free and i used it a lot for notes. Now they are blackmailing me to pay in order to access my old notes. This should be illegal. Do not use this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Wasn't able to take a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated to the least stars as Evernote has now turned to a very expensive option compared to others available in the market"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it wont let you cancel your membership, nonstop adds whenever you open the app and notes, accidentally hit subscribe and it lags when you try to cancel. frankly if i could give it zero star i wouldve. shame bc it used to be great to keep your notes and to do list"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"greedy scumbags ruined a great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they keep jacking the price and making it over complicated to use. I miss the old Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote limiting the amount of notes for free accounts is really a bold move - a horrific bold move nontheless. The dude who approved this must woke up recently from his sleep in a cave after 10 years of being inactive. Telling customers straight up ""we are desperate financially"" would have sounded better than pulling this off irresponsibly. And I have less than 15 notes on my account. Good luck staying competitive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't take the long waiting ads anymore (two in a row plus a final screen to close). I'm switching to another app as I write this review, I want to say thanks for many years of service Evernote folks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT. AND I REPEAT DO NOT USE THIS APP! I am a writer who used this app for years to write ideas, scripts and other things. Now I'm locked out, unless i buy the exorbitantly priced payed version. 14.99 a month, for thier note pad app! That's more than a tv streaming service. Years worth of material, flushed down the drain, and I will never get it back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unusable without an overpriced monthly plan. what a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Failing in the main task: don't expect taking quickly notes and finding them easily when needed. Instead of this you get tons of functions you don't need. Newest anger: on almost every launch I get an ""What's new"" info. I'm don't care what's new in this app, I just wanna make a note for a YouTube video so I can find this exact point in this video. But fail again, this app embeds without asking a YouTube video instead of saving the link and fails then later playing the video at the chosen point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sick n tired of this app, ads and asking for subscription everytime. Not as good as it used to be earlier."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusably slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since the beginning of 2024 Evernote has a huge change in their business plan, limiting the device on the free version. Understandable. And then start to force user to subscribe on every time user open the notes the pop up will annoyingly open as to force user to pay. And now the worst era has come. We had to watch insanely 10-15s ads before using the app. Been using this more than a decade but now really considering to moving out. I know that you needed money, but not in this way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your time downloading this app like I did and do not ignore the reviews bcz they are absolutely right! Worst app ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot demo because app forces entry of your email or google account, I'll give you that when I'm ready to keep the program, not before. There's a serious issue where support doesn't answer all the people that are complaining about features that are broken or who have lost their notes. I would not want to lose my notes. There's also other serious issues that the fees for this program has substantially increased between $60 and $140 a year. It appears that this program is a pile of Elephant Dung."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"price is a bit steep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous price increase means that I now will be abandoning this app after using it for years. I trust that there will still be access to stored data to date."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is a good application but now a days it forces users to take paid version if you don't take 1. It limits on notebooks you make 2. It reduces the size of notes 3. For every click on application (notes) pop for purchase paid version 4. It reduces the sync devices (only 1 in free version the device itself) These are also fine but now terrible things happen 6. It pops up irrelevant ads for every click By the way thanks to evernote team. I used this app for long time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No payment history for Google subscription. Evernote ignored an annual personal subscription payment paid through Google; within 2 weeks another annual personal subscription (for the same subscription) auto-deduction was made at the Evernote website. I requested a refund for the Evernote deduction; their refund form requires that the subscription be downgraded. To keep my info on their site, I had to agree to paying for the same personal subscription again, monthly. No chat or phone help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is a great app for creating notes. Advertisements hooked me. However, I may ask, is the lag really INTENTIONAL? Like. Your app is doing well in every aspect. But the lag is breaking its functionality. Fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: downgrading to 1 star: you made it even worse. From no ads to banner ads & full-screen unskippable ads appearing out of nowhere. (They were not appearing before, in the free version. Now they're everywhere). Greedy mfs. From one of my favourites to the worst note app. You don't deserve anything. Old review : Ffs, can you just stop giving popup of ""Buy Premium"" every time i launch the app. So annoying, can't even disable it forever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even access my information (notes) without having to subscribe. I was not informed of this but I cannot access my notes. Fix it. I need access to my info!!!!! Fix it!!!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Should have updated this from years ago. This went from one of the best note apps to the worst. Being a free app with as many notes as you want to then needing a subscription for more than a limited amount of notes. Finally devolving to having to watch ads before viewing your notes if you don't pay. I'll be transferring all my data to an app that isn't awful. Hope this shuts down soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"There has been a significant improvement in the user experience, with the elimination of intrusive and disruptive advertisements."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Feeling strong armed into a monthly fee... Longtime user, this is not cool. Furthermore, certain notes cannot be accessed, Android says it detects a bug. Please fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have lost good customers by being greedy. Zoho is a good alternative so ban evernote for good and let them learn a lesson for being greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of ads and premium ads are unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can I set active device? if you block app immediately, when I just open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful! Even after I re-subscribe to personal plan and pay the fee via Evernote web, my Android Evernote app still constantly show up I am a limited (free) account, which prevents me from using it like a way of paid user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the last update it keeps crashing. Was a happy user for years. Please fix this asap. Considering switching to an alternative!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop pushing customers buy your product. Why pushing everytime ??? Update : now they force us to watch ads. Uninstall now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unfortunately not as good as it used to be. Basically one of my notes disappeared randomly while other seemed to have corrupted pictures. Alright, that's fine since I always have a device not always connected to Internet and I can recover everything offline but what's been really annoying is the recent price change. +100€/yr. for a note organizer app? Nah, that's definitely way too expensive for me. Not even the 🍎 only alternatives cost that much with their lifetime license."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use Evernote mostly for work, but track a few personal things as well. Problem 1: I can't access Evernote from my phone without using the app. I should be able to use the website. Problem 2: Suddenly Evernote refuses to allow people who have been using it for years to have Evernote on more than one device without paying. New problem: the Bending Spoons program has made Evernote significantly worse. It's constantly frozen loading the page, & logs me out almost every day now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been my note taking app for more than 7 years and I used to love it, but it has gone worse and worse for the last couple of years. The latest update v. 10.113.1 was the nail on the coffin. They added a HORRIBLE Ad experience, on your face, witch is pressing me to move to an other provider. Don't update to it. You will regret it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"شكرا🤍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The App is becoming worse with every update. Probably it's time to look for an alternative after so many years of use. Disappointing. Shame on you guys. You guys just trying to sell your expensive subscription by troubling free users more and more as a strategy. And not providing a cheaper plan to those with basic text notetaking need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely frustrating app. Constantly having to close the keyboard and reopen to be able to type. Very buggy and frustrating to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent and now it is awful. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Unable to name Notes. It always comes with a title ""Untitled Note"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using for almost a year, this app will force people to purchase. If not, you won't be able to read your own notes. Beware!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app. for years, they got greedy and wanted too much money. First, it was free with a maximum of 3 notebooks. Then they cut it down to two, but it was still free. They gradually started charging and now a 50 file storage limit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Allez hop on remballe, direction Joplin avec Dropbox, car le carnet x1 / 50 notes ou 99.99€ par an c'est pas humain... Etouffez-vous avec vos derniers utilisateurs vache à lait. Edit: Compte Evernote supprimé, faites pareil !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"addition of ads in done to force users to subscription plan or move them out of Evernote. never using Evernote again. paid plans are extremely costly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't give bad reviews, but it almost feels necessary here I've been using Evernote for 6.5 years. Generally, I was satisfied with their services for the first 4 years. In the last 2, it's been getting worse & worse. It's very clear that they're pushing people towards their paid version, with increasing reminders, promotions every time I log-in. Now, they're adding irritating ads that you cannot close until the end. This is not how you inspire me to buy your services. This is manipulation..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Why it's not updating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Cannot add notes on my Android phone using the keyboard."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to live this app. It was great for keeping notes, saving links and keeping important documents in one place. Unfortunately it appears that constantly bombarding with paid subscriptions and attached documents and photos are now unable to be retrieved are the new norm. I've lost documents that were important and I've only just realized this after going to clean out old notes. It appears anything older than a year old is just plain corrupted. DO NOT USE FOR SAVING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is the go to app for my digital life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely disappointing They made it subscribtion based, and they do not allow me to access my old notes to save. I kept the kids Christmas wishlist there, shocking I'm not able to access without paying for a month:("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible logging in experience. Just goes back on log in!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's worst product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"perfect tool for notes and writing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The New Evernote is a superb experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go-to, now I'm looking for an alternative. Hoping the next note app doesn't get bogged down with subscription popups, I just need a text editor that's not cloud synced, man. What happened to utilizing hardware"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"still going strong"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too pressing users to migrate to premium version. First limit the devices (up to 2). Then, limit the notes up to 50. Then, limit to 1 device only. And now crazy amounts of advertisement. Hahaha. Honestly, this was a great note taking app. But it is not good enough to get money from users. Just use Google Keep or other free apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pricey but not handy enough, use it for pwd management and will replace it one day in the future"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Android user - I used to LOVE this app. It got me through college. But now the keyboard freezes every time I start typing and I've heard this is a problem for Android users. So if you have an android os maybe just skip this app until they get the keyboard fixed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like Evernote, but the price keeps going up and they're not adding features that are worthwhile to the majority of their customer base. Most of us are just taking notes, guys. We don't want to pay for all the bells and whistles like the AI-whatever and collaboration stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The user experience gets shittier everyday. Esp on Mobile, Android. Can someone fix the basics? App doesn't work properly. It's a struggle to type and save a new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Day by day it is becoming pathetic. Now they have ads too. Disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Demanding subscription to even see my old notes. Literally ransomware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience with recent updates after being a loyal user for very very long"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Installed 10 years ago. LOVED IT. But no more. It is now zero stars. I installed when it was free and wonderful. (2014?) Later, there was an upgrade ""pay version"" avail which could do more things, but I didn't need those. Then, rules changed, & the free version was limited on how many notes you can make before buying the paid version. Now, I can't access my existing notes without buying it. Not even to copy them over to a different free app. I NEED some of these notes today. 😵‍💫"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bring back the free two-device option! This limitation is unacceptable and unfair!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too expensive when OneDrive is free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is great but it logs put every 2 to 3 days and have to logging back which is really annoying and time consuming"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, don't even bother using it now. Just find another app that won't keep your data hostage. You can't even disconnect a sync because the button is greyed out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No notification that this was going to have to be a paid subscription just locked out and loss of my notes. No way to even pay the subscription to retrieve my notes. Very disappointed with no service supports. Do not recommend and do not waste your time with this product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"T1-701u-63324284"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many requests to upgrade, upgrades are too expensive. Time to look for a better app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Wow! This 2014 review is a sad reminder of what Everyone left behind. Now uninstalled and moved to Obsidian. 2014 Review: Been using Evernote a long time. Tried Springpad when that came out, but came back to Evernote after a year. Now Springpad is gone and Evernote just keeps getting better. I clip bookmarks, take notes, create reminders, to-do/check out lists, daily work trackers. Finally got my wife to try and she loves it. In the end, you have to ask what can't it do as a note keeping app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is now limited to only 1 device in free plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to pay to use it on more than ONE device??? It used to work just good enough with two devices, there was literally NO NEED to change it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A lot of time has gone by, and I've changed my rating. Ive retired and no longer need nor can I afford such robust software. I did like it for my recipes, but not for $140+ a year and now Ive been using One Note! Somehow, it was set to autorenew, and I was charged over $140 while I was in the hospital, so it seems I'm out that money. auto-renew sucks! plus, when did the price go up so high?? not happy over here at all!! Can I get a refund for this payment as I haven't used this in years??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's good 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"suckered me into paying somehow I hit a button and I cannot figure out how to get my money back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash, you can't even access your own previous notes without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"can't share notes as a pdf"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Using this app (without payed subscription) from 2017. Everything was satisfactory until last update. It's become impossible to work with, advertising does not allow you to do anything. Sorry but forced to look for another app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 1 device allow to login in evernote and now ads added, nice. You have to pay to use evernote more, Evernote made for great money..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very nice update now with ads!! Uninstalling and goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally disappointed from the price increased and becoming even slower app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using them since 2010"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too many bugs. Too hard to send bug report."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I HATE this app so much! I'm always losing content because of sync issues and it infuriates me! I was literally writing for hours and ended up losing over 500 words worth of ideas. This is not the first time this happens, and I did email many times and even upgraded a few times to access note history but it never retrieved anything. I hate this app so much and it's not worth a single cent. Even worse now that you're only allowed 1 synced device. I'm done with this garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is not letting me back into my notes after this latest update!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this for years but eventually got fed up with the constant (and I do mean CONSTANT) subscription nagging and uninstalled it. If you're looking to use this as a free user then don't bother"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is buggy, overpriced at $129/year, and has terrible support. You’re forced to choose irrelevant options when seeking help, responses are canned and unhelpful, and there’s no phone support. I wouldn’t recommend Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"super slow in the last few updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complete garbage! I've been using Evernote for over 10 yrs (paid version). Since it was bought by the current owner, the price has doubled, and it has gotten worse and worse over time. Currently, it has become virtually useless. DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible company! Had it years, just using ONE note and now they locked it behind pay wall, THE FREE VERSION!! Can't even access my free mote that I have depended on for phone numbers for years suddenly!! This is almost predatory and invasive! I can't even open it to make a back up! DISGUSTING AND I HOPE THEY LOSE ALL THEOR CUSTOMERS BECAUSE OF THIS! SHAMEFUL AND DISGUSTING! DO NOT GET THIS APP WHEN THERES PLENTY OF FREE BETTER ONES!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive used Evernote for probably the last 15ish years, and sadly it has consistently gone downhill as the years go by. Charging for software that doesn't work anymore, being extremely greedy in asking to buy a subscription multiple times in the span of 5 minutes, releasing a bunch of updates that add new features that are useless while allowing the core functionality of note-taking to become unusable on mobile devices. It's time to begin my migration off of evernote and onto something that works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before they started charging for more features. Now I can't even create 1 new note without having to pay for something."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well hold you hostage of you don't subscribe Was a loyal user of free version for many years. Last few months, it began throwing up messages to subscribe. As soon as you open the note you want, this would pop up and Cover the whole screen. Treacherous when you want it in a hurry. Today, it began showing pop ups without any close option. The pop up works be a noisy ad for some game or dating app!!. And there is no way to close it. Treachery. Uninstalling. No way out. Don't trust it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"All good thing come to an end, I guess it's time, fair enough. Thanks for a decade of service. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is getting worse and worse. I used to love this app back in the days. But the dev decided to make income by locking you to use in multiple device. TODAY, They started Ads on this app! Like bruh everytime we need to read my note I need to watch an freaking ads first?!?!? Totally trash app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Make it clear in the app that you need a subscription. No a trial does not mean you don't need a subscription. No one needs an just for 4 weeks, then never to be used again. You've wasted ""my"" time. If that doesn't sell, change what the product is price Vs proposition. Also, 100 per year?! Have you seen how much a 365 sub costs? You need to run more efficiently do you can take better care of out costs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"holy hell I can't write a single note without half a dozen popups asking me to get premium. what happened to this once great all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, bit nowadays full of bugs and super slow. Uninstalled and not coming back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very handy for personal and family organization. I have been using Evernote for 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads so much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have loved Evernote for almost TWO decades. I'm giving up on it today. In the last year or so it has gotten more expensive, less functional, and irritating. With this newest update, the app is essentially useless, and paying anything for it should not be legal. I feel like I should get money back! Terrible experience!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a handy app, until they changed their business model and ruined their app. Now I can't retrieve the data from my own files."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop trying to make me subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Use to be great, now you have to sail among 55 pop-ups that try to force you to buy the premium version. Moving away from this app for that reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting worse and worse every year. Extremely hard to delete account, almost impossible to delete account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"a little spendy if you want it to be super good but it's worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eveetime notification for paid version.. Now ads are showing Eveetime you use it.. Very annoying... Going to uninstall it..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ok-now I can't access any of my notes unless I pay! Totally locked out! Highway robbery. I've been using the free version for years. Total disappointment. Negative 10 stars! UPDATE: YES, Evernote sent a timely reply with a ONE-TIME ONLY FIX solution. Every time I try to use the app to access years worth of information (since 2014), I am met with a screen that states I must pay a subscription fee. Very disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frustrating to say the least. Wastage of time and money. This App used to be great but no more. Surprising Play Store is allowing it for buy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ads with a feature where you can make notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only use this on 1 device but it says I need to pay $17.99 a month for more devices. It won't let me access my old notes with info I need now. I am definitely switching to Google notes but trying to figure out how to get my info first. I would pay a few dollars but no way I am paying $100 a year for a slow notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Many years with Evernote but now cancelling. Very buggy app over past year and now double the price for new bugs. Very sorry to see this app go down the drain."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Gets harder to use with every update. Still holding out hope."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't log in with any of the options they give."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was free. Now every clicks come with offer to subscribe. Such an annoyance. What a waste of time. Definitely saying goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously expensive!! And I accidentally purchased one month at $14.99 when I was trying to click out of the app!! They took the money out of my bank account even though I canceled it right away!! How do I get in touch with the developer?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Best note taking app years ago, now an annoying mess of weird UI and ads. And you can only ""sync"" to 1 device now. Absolute dogwater."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't get a proper reply on my submitted request regarding the issue of change of currency for payment plans, an AI keeps replying me back on my requests and there is not even an option for me to reply back either. All the replies I got from your AI has been extremely unhelpful; So I got fed up with your incompetent customer support system and deleted the app on phone and on my PC."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used be great. Get inundated with ads to upgrade everytime. And then there's a bug, probably for foldable phones, where typing in a note randomly the keyboard goes away. I think maybe it's because it's registering a key press on something behind it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is very buggy, initial loading screen is long . These are the issues I faced 1) One day all my data got deleted, and my subscription was no more there, i had to create a new account with email adress - I used Evernote for just 1 month and did not have much data left. 2) I don't get notifications for my task reminders. Just imagine not getting not getting notifications on a note taking app. Customer service didn't respond in both the above cases even though I have a premium account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot uninstall or stop payments . Not happy with this at all. Don't even try it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible Now. I've been using this for several years. Recently, out of the blue, my bank account was charged $129 for a year's subscription that I DID NOT ORDER! Was able to get the money refunded, but it was very annoying. You've taken a once wonderful app, and because of your greed and constant attempts to get people to subscribe, it's now not worth using. I have deleted all my notes and am no longer using. Wouldn't even have given you one star, but I had to give one to post this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No le encontraba utilidad al principio, pero después se convirtió en una de mis favoritas. 2024: al convertirla en una app más de suscripción perdió su encanto. Me he pasado a Onenote. Curiosamente en los screenshots dicen que tienen 4 estrellas, pero vean ustedes mismos hoy oct 2024 tiene 2.8"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uses to be very good, but it's full of pop-ups now, asking you to pay and to unsync even the browser to use it via the app. Terrible experience, I've migrated to google keep after years of Evernote, as its so full of interruptions now. Unfortunately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use this app extensively, found that all my previous notes are gone, I can no longer sync it to multiple devices without paying a costly subscription, and had something in the realm of 5-6 pop-ups trying to get me to pay them. Google Note is a far superior (and free!) option compared to this now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of the most useful apps I've ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It feels like they had a free version to trap you. They started with limited functionality & limited number of notes, which worked for my purpose. Then they kept reducing the number of free notes & I deleted the extra notes to stay within the free version limit. Now they have a pop-up that pushes me to sign up for a monthly plan & doesn't even allow me to access my saved notes to transfer or delete them. My data is pretty much taken hostage for the exchange of money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite until they got onboard with the stupid ""subscription"" based market that everyone despises. I tried going on it again and it wouldn't allow me in the app without downloading my file and them telling me to send the contents to them via email and to ""edit out sensitive information"" if I want. Can't even use it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using it for over a decade. Don't mind paying. Renewing the personal subscription each year. But now it became just too much. The functionality seems as an overkill. Feels like they just add useless features in order to justify the crazy price spikes. All I need is a notes database. Cross prlatform. Some files upload. That's it. Looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't really love that when you create checklists and accidentally miss the check box that it automatically goes into edit mode. Can you make it so you have to click on an edit button to change a note, please? Everything else is pretty good. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I like using Evernote and I pay for it but for some reason recently I have noticed a lot of glitches using it on my android phone. There are problems with typing, I will type something and it’ll immediately disappear. Also with editing there are issues when I’m trying to erase things it only partially erases and it’s very hard to report these glitches because you have The usage log, which does not always download. The extra steps of everything needed to report the glitches is a challenge."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Signed up for free trial and you cannot cancel until after the first billing.Had to sign up to get my old information from the app. I real rip OFF"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Web version is alright, but the app lags a lot and most of its features like tables and bullet points dont fit well on a phone screen. Opening the same notebook on different devices also requires you to pay for premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How does this company survive? Googled bending spoons to see what other apps they have as they ruined meetup and not surprised AT ALL to see the exact same reviews on this app too. Such ignorance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fees. I thought this was a good free spp. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know what you've done with the app, but it doesn't let me create new notebooks, at least not for free. It was a great app but now it makes you pay for almost anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having first installed this app in 2019, I can confidently say that Evernote gradually went from the best notepad I've used to the absolute worst one. Somewhere along the way things took a really bad turn, and now I'm in desperate need of a replacement for what used to be the only notepad I needed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could give this app no stars I would. I did nit sign up for a subscription and was just checking out the app because I was recommended to it by a friend and didn't think it would be something I would use. I never signed up for anything for the app but they keep charging my Google account. I have reached out to Google and was told to reachout to Evernote but no one has responded. I hope no one chooses to even check this app out because it comes with a price apparently with no customer servic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gone downhill over the last year. Captchas show everywhere!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Utter wastage of time now, having been previously excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute disgrace of an app forcing free users to sign up to paid plans, before they can even attempt to access any notes taken. I'd give it zero stars if I could. Evernote I see your app dying by the end of 2024. Good riddance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ultra, ultra slow after update when taking pic for notes, please look into this - you are making people unproductive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It was more reliable for taking notes in-meeting last year, but now at times it just clocks and you can't type more of the ongoing meeting. But as far as storing and organizing notes (after you take them during meeting in another app), it's still excellent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit. Sketch app stopped working about a year ago. No fixes. Dumping. This is the app I use to make a quick note or a long memo. Now that there is handwriting capabilities, this killer app became a KILLER APP! Especially with S PEN."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I need to take an important note, it will randomly stopped taking my input stopping halfway through a word as I type. Not allowing to continue. It has failed me at the worst times too many times. I'm done with this stupid app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot even export or share as pdf in android bloody dumb ain't it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Finally the app is usable again as of 10/24. Problem with widgets saying no content when asked to show list of notebooks. Still waiting for you to ask a sensible subscription like £20 a year, until then not paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They increase price in 6 times which makes this app not affordable, after 13 years of using it. Now personal plan is more expensive then MS Office family plan. It's a SHAME. I hope I can make backup for my notes before they bankruptcy and will be closed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app of my life 😔, whenever I open my laptop always show the pop-up of Evernote to me ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated app and my notes disappear 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gotta pay to view my past notes. No thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Am about to lose all my work, cus Ur app refuse to open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Still NOT able to type/edit an existing note?? Allows typing of 2 letters/numbers/special characters than nothing? Using Android phone, iPad EN working with no issues"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Love my Evernote has helped me to journal, save information, and write."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly harassing me to pay for a subscription. Trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Imagine, every time you leave your house, there's a homeless person waiting outside asking for money, that's what this app feels like. I've used this app probably for 15+years. I use it as a simple note app, believe it or not. Unfortunately, the app has become slow, buggy and greedy.... So, finally I have found an alternative app which does exactly what I need, without all the negatives that Evernote has accumulated recently. That app is called Notion. Edit: Why not make a lite version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use this **** I lost all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unstable and temperamental. I used to love this app however recently a few issues have made it unsuable. For starters, I can not even get through a sentence of text without cursor freezing, jumping to an unrelated line, or the keyboard becoming unresponsive. Why am I paying for a note-taking app that can't even get through a sentence... photos and documents constantly freeze or show up as corrupt photos are sometimes there and sometimes not. Text goes missing, on and on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ads to push you toward paid are ABOMINABLE now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"overpriced"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Difficult navigating app.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would have given Evernote 5 stars a year or 2 before it went to it's current subscription model. I used Evernote for about 10 years, made thousands of notes in dozens of notebooks FOR FREE. Only had to pay if I wanted my notes available on more than 2 devices and available offline. Now They want me to pay to make any more notes or notebooks. At least I can still access my notes so I can copy them to another free note app like OneNote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Everything feels great. Except the sketch feature which works only occasionally in the app, it's completely fine on the desktop app with a pentab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously expensive to just use 2 devices to share a couple of notes. Just migrate them somewhere else, this app is not worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seriously only one connected device that really stupid decision ever, seriously why not just make this app pay to begin with"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Make the app more smoother, and should take less time to process anything, like opening, switching from one note to another"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too much advertisement. To much push to pay during free Triel. Now only free sync. on one device. You need to sign out on the phone to check for free on PC or Web version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update; My original review mentioned getting a notification about limits on numbers of notes, 50 notes and a notebook. I came to look up something and found it's now 2 notes you can make... TWO. These clowns want like $112 a year for unlimited notes. I have two other apps that I can use for free that let me do unlimited notes so I have no need for this app or greedy Bosh'tets that run it. Pass on the 💩 app and try Inkpad or Notepad. I have both. They're not pretty but they're FREE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome App! Keeps me on point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow but Consistent Decline I've used Evernote since 2014ish, and the free version was exceptional. Now, I can't even access my notes from two devices. Lol, a basic feature is no longer a feature, phone and computer use. The subscription price is an absolute joke. Greedy corporation, and it'll never have my business, or any of its associated companies."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has become near impossible to use. It stops accepting typed notes after the first few letters that have been typed. Not sure how to fix??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My favorite note app. :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I believe evernote was bought out. No customer service found. How do I ca cancel it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since 2017, it always proved to be a useful task related note taking app as weekly routine for many people. But slowly restrictions increased and features became limited. Intrusive & cumbersome popups & banner were introduced but we tolerated. At least basic 2 devices should be provided ( with ads ). Imposing greedy restrictions repeatedly now compelled many long-term users to move on to an alternative app. Thanks for past and Good luck for future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Beware you can not sync multiple devices without paying a subscription. Never responded.. If you can't login you can't access support. But I finally got it to sign in after trying 4 months ago and it bugging and getting NO help. They need to have contact information for support and it actually work instead of the support email auto emailing back saying to use in app support..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't remove my old devices. Tried many times, at last page app doesn't work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"(edited) officially useless after ridiculous price hikes. With resources like Notion, OneNote, and others giving at least 2 device sync for free while Evernote is minimum $80/year! Not worth it, there's morning special this app does anymore that others can't do too with better cross platform integration. Very disappointed in how poorly this app hasn't kept pace."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Хорошая была программа, пользовался ей больше 10 лет."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great notes app, inc. receipts,doc scans,etc. Pricy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dont use this apps, they will blackmail you with no option to get your notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"easy to use and retrieve when needed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Secondary features over stability. Frivolous integrations over performance. Why Bending Spoons decided to acquire Evernote only to take it in this direction is one of the great mysteries of the world. And you know how the ending goes. Don't expect support to help you if you do have an issue. The AI bot will do its best, but reach out to a human and you would only get a notification that a case has been opened. That's it. No follow up. No other communication. Sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app now! This app used to be FREE until it wasn't, as they jumped on the GREED train, which isn't cheap. Furthermore, the app no longer has a simple print function. I can't find where to print a note! I am looking for a new app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashes constantly on Android. Keyboard freezes and jumps constantly. I've been a user for years time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My dats are gone because of this worst app😤"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Instant uninstall because you can't even try it out to see if you want to pay for it - they force your payment info in order to access the free trial. I'm not gonna give you my CC info if I'm not even sure your product works! (Which according to these reviews, it doesn't lol)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for a long time, now it's not even usable. The glitches are out of control so sadly I will be moving on to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It won't let me disconnect devices to get down to one but forces me to subscribe to keep all devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, now it limits you to one device when other more powerful free apps like notion work without limits, if you can't access with several devices it's pretty useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login or access any of their website portals. Seeing on other forums they are unreliable with access. A bit concerning and cannot get any instruction or assistance to fix or troubleshoot. Would not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but it has gotten progressively bad and greedy. A reminder to get their premium version is okay... But getting bombarded by ad to get premium every couple of clicks is desperate. Uninstalled and moved to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good now even free plan won't let you add anything even if below maximum allowed, keeps spamming to upgrade to even access your free content- 10/2024 well now worthless app,they deleted my saved notes so now it's a empty app needless to say bye-bye-bye least l got My stuff copied over to a different location,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"10 years ago it was great and I had a paid subscription. Since that time it's become a mess and including new features that have little use for most of their core users. Performance dived and any support issues I submitted went unanswered. Then came a huge price increase, way more than it should have been for an app like this. At that point I had to end using it after over 10 years. Pretty sad, it used to be a too-notch app, but no more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"every week they remove more free features, use Notion instead, worked me like a charm and can do waaaay more for freev"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was once a very good and user-friendly app, but in later years it became a very third class app and now login several years later, it is still a similar third class app 👎👎👎👎 My entire data has vanished! BC!!! 🤬😡👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It is not free as advertised, I just installed it and deleted it. 😁"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sketch not work wish spen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since the start, but the constant popups urging me to upgrade to a paid plan have become incredibly frustrating. Additionally, the limitation of using it on just one device is a dealbreaker for me. I'm grateful for the experience, but it's time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, has become a flop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app to organize information. Now a worthless app that sits forever at the loading screen so I can't access anything. Just another horrible money gran program, don't bother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The developer has been restricting more and more features for years, to the point now where it's no longer worth the space on my phone. Goodbye Evernote, you aren't worth a fraction of the price you want us to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app since 2013 and now I can't even see my notes without an un-closable paywall demanding money. It went from the best note app ever to absolute trash. Don't bother with this app, move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was great before Bending Spoons bought it. Used to have a free version and worked very well and reliably. Now there is no free version and it works less than half as well..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Oct 2024 update...last review was >5yrs ago and now EN bugs me more than helps. Constant updates everything i open the app on my pc, the keyboard is flaky on my phone, forces me to read updates and the price just isn't worth it anymore especially when I already pay less for Office and Onenote. Also, so many bugs. I miss the simple functionality, and clean & fast UI of old. They make it way hard to cancel and I suspect this is on purpose. Their billing page has been down for over a day now! Hmmm"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been paying for Evernote for over a year. In that time it's gotten worse and worse until now it's literally unusable. You can't even type in the app. What's the point of a notes app if you can't type notes?!?!?!? I've tried this across multiple different devices. Same bugs everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Due to the company's greed I have uninstalled for the last time. I choose a free plan and why am I being told I can't use the web and my phone because of only one device that can my synced and I AM USING ONLY ONE DEVICE TO BE SYNCED. The website is NOT supposed to be counted as a device! Trying to use my mobile device will constantly try to load the page and never finish loading on both my laptop and the phone. Total waste of time for a free app service that can't be used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not even as advertised plus max 50 notes and can't do much cause the ads! Plus if you want the free trial you get 7 days but they make you pay a full year $200 sum?! Why give me a free trial but make its horrid to try and back out nah. Absolute trash I'm sticking to paper and pencil. This app is a full disappointment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was really really good until I can't use it on multiple devices anymore. It's almost like a ransomware and now I have to pay to access my files on multiple devices. With Notion being free there's no point paying for Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It seems that the app runs in normal speed now after a few updates lately!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be a really great app for me, but all the restrictions and added expenses have looking elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Worst experience. The app is allowing me to log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Intrusive marketing and tough logging in as it always quits to the home screen when you use a password manager. phone app isn't friendly to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app continues to get worse and more buggy. Anytime I start typing a sentence afyer a few words it just glutches to another area of the screen and the keyboard dissappears or it glutches to a different section of the note. Would never pay for premium when the current version has trouble loading and keeps making duplicate notes. Years ago, it was great, but they kept ""updating"" it just causing more issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App no longer functional"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now wants to monetize everything in an obnoxious way. Boggles my mind that I can only sync 1 device without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app. It feels so easy to use and adapt to my needs. the best journal app I've tried."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was good now limit to one device and one notebook and 50 notes. Locking people in and discouraging other people from using it. I liked it at first but lack of features and layout isn't great but the above was the final straw"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"130.00 for notes a year :D? I had the free version but heck no. I got lots of free apps for notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"i can appreciate that this app is being maintained and continuously developed by bending spoons. thank you for not neglecting this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Una cosa es que pongan anuncios, otra peor que habiendo llegado al límite no te dejen mover tus notas existentes, pero ahora nisiquiera permiten ver mis notas si no me suscribo. Practicamente tienen mis notas secuestradas."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app has potential to be great but it's too unresponsive and slow. Tried on 2 devices. It lags to get into different menus, or lags to change font sizes. Too much is happening on screen when you're typing on a mobile device that's there's not enough screen real estate. Good idea for an app, bad execution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Just works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This aap should be free of cost 😓"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When will you make themed icon? Even Instagram, WhatsApp, Spotify did it, and you??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I purchased Evernote 8-10 years ago. I liked that I could sync it on my phone and desktop. But, over the last 3 years, they kept degrading the service - limiting the number of notes and notebooks, and then they wouldn't allow me to sync even to one device unless I paid a monthly subscription. POOR service. I'm paying for a subscription to MS Office 365, so switched to OneNote. Other than copying my notes over, it has been seamless. The interface is as good or better, and no sync limits!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice first time ⌚ & user 👤 👥 experience..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"There is some bug in the app.. it is not opening in Android"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Poor customer support!!! I am changing my previous 5 star rating to 2. I am a paid subscriber. I have been repeatedly asking to introduce an option for reduction of spacing in the notes in between two sentences. But developers have not done so even after 3 repeated requests. May I request you for the 4th time please!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before this i give 5, now 1 because of subscription scheme. Stupid developer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get off of this app you WILL lose all of your work done in it. I have been using Evernote as my main writing tool for over 11 years and, sadly, that ends today. Slowly throughout the years they have been removing features that were once a core part of the free experience and within the last two years they have been opting for the motto to take all already written notes hostage and put them behind a paywall. Today I can't even write a note without their pop-up to pay flashing every 10 seconds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open notes with photos... It's crashing immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has become trash. Forces rotating my screen even though I have it off. I hate screen rotation unless I'm playing a game. There is an X on the free trial ad that assumed meant I could close it. Nope forces the ab page to open and asks you twice if you are sure you don't want the free trial and 40% off. Haven't used this app in a while and use to pay for it but coming back to this has got me looking elsewhere. Sorry uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their security system is very leaky. My account has been hacked more than once, but not my email, just Evernote itself. I went in today and my account had been deleted, even though I hadn't logged in in six months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the EVERNOTE update on 10-15-2024, the app has been consistently crashing and won’t open at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crashes. Fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update - terrible, it crashes almost immediately ; pl fix Recent versions - with the new look and feel - of Evernote are really very good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use this app. They are holding my information hostage. They are forcing me to pay for a subscription. There is no way of bypassing the screen to get my information from the notes. Not a chance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Decent note app, but went to paid only and has locked me out of all of my notes. Very frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My research says this used to be the best note taking app, compatible with my productivity tools. Just downloaded it and it's just a scummy money grab. I guess it changed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A mere shadow of what it used to be. Slow, expensive, demanding subscription even for old users who use to have the features for free. Especially when there are tons of better alternatives now, I see no point in keeping using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Oct 18 2024 Can to go from horrible to sleazy and horrible? YES they can!! Evernote wins it hands down!! Great to Horrible! I too, like the other reviewers have been using this app for several years. The latest version is making the app unreliable and slooow. If it is not fixed soon will move on to another app! Edited"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Half the time, the app is unreliable and painfully slow. It's very discouraging, because I've used Evernote for years, but I'm considering transferring all my data to OneNote and canceling my Evernote account. EDIT: Sorry, there is something profoundly wrong with the app in the last week. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. The PC version continues to work fine. But I'm knocking off another star until the app is fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app crashes every time I try to open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was once (a very long time ago) the best note taking app available. Is now absolute trash that I've finally uninstalled after moving all my notes. I truly can't believe anyone is stupid enough to pay for this glitchy, awkward mess of an app. Y'all should be ashamed for destroying this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was amazing when it was free, loved it.the repeted pop while trying to use the app to subscribe is annoying.i would have subscribed if the monthly or yearly amount was reasonable. 2.4k annually and 500rs monthly is insane.i have so many notes saved in EN and now i cant even access them. So very disappointed!ugh!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"There is a daily journal appearing which is very annoying and no way to off it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Irritating app, on every single tap, pop ups for subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time using this money grubbing app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You are doing it all wrong. Instead of making a better product, you just making it less accessible, cutting down features and adding constant popups to upgrade. Good luck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How do commercial businesses manage with this abomination that EN has become. & is now 100% not fit for purpose. I spend far to much of valuable time TRYING to get what i am paying for to work as expected. Y do EN seem to think it is acceptable to charge a premium annual rate for a product THAT DOES NOT WORK. Has slowly crawled to a dead stop. Look at all of 1stars gaining pace. AT EVERY UPDATE IT GETS WORSE. Presently moving all my notes away from this over paid for garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I do not take notes frequently, just need to jote down notes from time to time. If you are looking for a free note taking app, this is not the app. It gives you 50 free notes, if you don't pay for subscription. The catch is, if you delete a note it it subtracts from the free notes limit. I deleted all my notes and am no longer able to make any more notes, I pretty much bricked this app unless I pay money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new update bugs, notes won't open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App suddenly crashes every time I open a note. I've been a subscriber for years. There's really poor support on the Evernote side. Considering we pay a lot for the service, this is quite unacceptable. In my past experience, Evernote don't value their customers. I would download another product - advance warning for potential subscribers. Evernote won't value you, and you will get ZERO support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update on mobile won't let you create formatted notes. New note, bullet point list, start typing - and it stops accepting input after a few characters. A note taking app that won't take (formatted) notes. Oops."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This has been my primary thought organizer for the past several years. Love is flexibility. Recently (2023) Android app started crashing every time I open certain saved notes, sometimes suggesting I clear the app's cache. There is no cash clear control available in the app or exposed via Android controls so I just force-stop the app or reboot, but the problem persists for that note. Pop-up says there's a bug in it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy. 1 device only now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless since last update because now on free plan you can log in from ONE device. Synchronisation is completely unavailable, you have nothing to synchronise with. Wonderful app was slowly and painfully killed by greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Originally a great app but became a poor app over time & now that a private equity firm took over it has become a worthless app. For those complaining that it forces you into paying a subscription it actually doesn't but tricks you into thinking you need to. You can bypass that and keep on a free model you just need to be careful. But do you even want to stay with Evernote when there are better cheaper options available?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You push me to pay I need my notes because I depend on it I need my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I could not open Evernote. Thanks to resolve this issue but now I cannot even open/access recent five old notes which I have saved. Kindly resolve this issue. 19/10/2024.. Again same problem occured after updating App. Earlier it was working perfectly but update has made life miserable. Sometimes feeling why should we use Evernote where they are blackmailing and locking the notes saved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be great Despite keeping up updates, the app on mobile (Android, Samsung S23 Ultra) has stopped responding to keyboard inputs. When I start or try to edit a note, it let's me type 1 to 2 letters in the body of the note then stops responding altogether. I've un-installed, reinstalled, forced stopped, cleared cache, cleared data, and nothing has worked. It's been doing it for months. The only place I can use it to start fresh notes is on desktop application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You store important info in it. First they allow you to do everything, then they ask for premium membership only to view that info. You cant even access your own contents without membership.. Wow !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lately it's hard to open and use the app. I need my notes urgently. Always crashing whenever i open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good app.... too bad you can only create 50 notes for free..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not working after update"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complety unusable on S23 ultra. Constant crashes Update. Clear cache. Clear data. Sluggish on my PC. Years subscription up in a month. I won't be continuing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good but user interface is mildly confusing to some extent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote extensively for more than a decade and have mostly loved it until the last year or so. It has slowly gotten more expensive, more bugs, less innovative new features. With this newest update the app is essentially useless. Typing is completely non functional. Back space erased three line your typing and closes the key board, every time. Typing in general is iffy. Some time it works for a sentence or two then suddenly you can't get more than two letters then it stops. Junk"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app... Lagging Lagging No response error Bad in Update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ThiRD Class EVERNOTE. I can't open App, Whenever try to open, EVERNOTE Bagging For MONEY. FORCE for Subscribing Their Month & yearly Pack. And EVERNOTE DO NOT ACCESS Me to open my Save Note. HORABLE APPLICATION EVERNOTE.😡🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locks up and states bug is the cause"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Used it for years, essential to my business, very customizable & flexible, cross platform, and fully modern."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app and service. I lost a lot of data to this service. Couldn't recover it on web either. Stay clear. I've been a payng customer for ages!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review: they have been ratcheting down on the number of devices in an effort to generate more revenue, I get that, but starting to count web interface as a ""device"" is just killing the app. Prior review from 11/19/2018: Excellent for notes and even better for clipping web pages."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"While generally it's overall a decent app, they severely overestimate how much a simple notes app is worth. I will be exporting and ditching this app shortly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"All of a sudden, it stops me from typing. I have to move cursor to another line and then move it back to where I was typing. Sometimes it lets me type 1 more letter, sometimes 3 and sometimes it starts to work again. It's really frustrating to take any notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not free, its a paid app i said. I was use some years ago. But now i cat recover the data as free. But why??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They went up way too high on their prices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was once a good app has become completely insufferable and unusable. The app will give you CONSTANT popups to upgrade to premium with literally every click you do. DNR!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know why but this app is not working any more for me. I'm being charged but it's not opening at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app and use it a lot. Then they introduced annoying pop-ups to make you buy the non free version. Now they made it so that you can use it only on one device (used to be at least 3). I moved all my notes to Notion app. Sorry Evernote, you're not that elite"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What's going on with this app now? I pay for it because I've always loved it, and now can't even type in it anymore on the phone, so it'd be hard for me to appreciate the new features (which I don't care about anyway). Glitching - please fix!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Forget it now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"price increase was ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once great app now absolutely full of popups trying to get you to upgrade to access even the most basic of features. Avoid like the plague and just use Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm a loyal premium user for the last decade. The updates of the desktop and android apps render the service unusable. I can't attach photos, the app crashes, the new layout is a distaster and many options (such as editing dates) are being removed... How is it possible to make a great product so bad within a couple of years? EDIT I have been provided with IP address exemption, installed and logged in the older version of the Android app. Now I'm able to use the app on my phones without issues"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"0 stars. Won't let me do anything without paying $15 first. Can't even scroll the page to explore the app, just get hit with an unclosable demand for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was pretty good app couple of years ago, but now it has very bad performance. I even think to swith to some other tool despite the fact that use Evernote about 8 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app started out with a limited free to use version several years ago. I had been using it for quite a while to keep notes and info handy on my phone. Suddenly, the app developer decided to discontinue the free app and not even allow access to any information that you had previously had stored. I CANNOT RECOMEND USING THIS APP AS THEY HOLD YOUR DATA HOSTAGE. User beware..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst greedy app uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to app for notes for years then the started charging way too much per month. Will change to Google keeps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've ruined Evernote. Worthless now. Old review:This is the best app on the market. It is perfect for organizing your plans, remembering things, tracking you to do list, and more. You can add your notes and thoughts on you phone or by using their app available for your computer. Whether on the go, in the office, or just sitting in you own home... where ever you add your ideas and notes, they all sync up to the cloud and are readily available to you anywhere you need them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pushing to buy subscription every second"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aggiornamento: è diventata impossibile da utilizzare, continua a proporre abbonamenti, i limiti non sono reali, ho 5 note e mi chiede già la sottoscrizione. Evitate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not god."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest version, two phones Android 10 & 11. Crashes whenever I try to open any previously saved note (with an image or any other file attached, scanned business cards, large notes, just plain text notes) unless it's been ""saved to offline"" beforehand. I'm a paying user, so the limits shouldn't apply like this, bus sometimes I can't even create a new note, the app crashes again. I tried rolling back to a previous version, but then Evernote just demands udate so it's unusable for me now. Awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't even open my notes without ur annoying pop up every 2 secs telling me to pay a hefty amt to access my free account! Without any prior info too! Had I known I would have migrated earlier. Better late than never so found a workaround to access the notes. Just needs some patience. Let your notes load by clicking on the one you want to see, keep closing tht shifty pop up n then switch off ur mobile internet n wifi, copy note content however u can n delete the notes. Uninstalled. Migrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use to use this app all the time and I loved it. Now. They are too money hungry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"As a user of the free app: Pros: You can write your notes down. Notes get backed up to the internet/ cloud so you could access them from another device - this brings me to the cons... Cons: You can't be logged in on more than one device unless you pay the subscription (you used to be able to). The most annoying thing about this app is that every time you open it you're prompted to pay for the subscription. Every single time. This makes me want to uninstall the app, not pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So sad to see it go down hill, what a great program it had been for me for years! Desktop version has broken 'Ctrl F' for find on a Note App!!! Works the 1st time, then stops working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly shoves ads in your face to get you to buy premium. This app is practically unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To use for free you can only have it on one device and have one notebook in the app and only 50 notes. It used to be better but now the company is just desperate for you to pay for the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lama gak buka apps ini..sekalinya mau dibuka untuk cek catatan, ehh harus bayar. untung ga penting2 amat.. hadeeeh cari apps lain mendingan deh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Turned into absolut trash. Nothing works and so many pop-ups just wanting more money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WORST APP OUT. UNABLE TO ACCESS ANYTHING . YOU GET FORCED TO CHOOSE A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. UNABLE TO CANCEL . UNABLE TO LOG OUT. UNABLE TO EMAIL EVERNOTE. CANNOT UNINSTALL APP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It requires subscription, tricking user by asking details to make app better and then in the end ask for subscription total waste of time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was free. Then, after recent update, it is a pay app and minimum cost is $14.99/mo. Of course no warning so if someone didn't want to pay or could not afford it, then they could migrate their data before it became locked without paying. How mean and draconian !! Also there is no way to contact the administrstors. All I wanted to do is remove my data. What comes around goes around."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Boring! I don't have the need to ""organize"" my notes. I'm not constantly making notes either so perhaps that's why I didn't find it useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be my favorite notes app, but recently in the past few years it asked to pay for a subscription Non-Stop multiple times when you use the app, which is incredibly annoying. The solution? Moving over to Google keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asks to create an account and pay a subscription before even letting take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: The app is slower than before. Logging in takes forever and the free plan is very limited while the premium is very expensive. Old: The app is very slow, opening notes is slow, and navigation is hard. They had also limited the number of devices in the free plan to two devices only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this before for free, boycott need to pay so we can use, such a trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly locked out and being charged for previously free ap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work without money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I began using Evernot in 2012. It was great. I wrote academic and creative works, planned visual works - documentary, magazine. I had collaborators join. The app worked great. In 2017 thereabout something started to change. I thought the glitches just needed to be solved. I thought the developers just needed time. As it turns out, the Evernote I was introduced to is no more. This app is not for people from low-income communities who love writing, organisation or the ability to access your work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but the restrictions applied to the free version now make it un-usable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use it when it was free. Then when they went to the paid version it was just too expensive. I found Google docs to be just as useful and just as easy to share and it is free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Simply the best!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good App ,It is help in gain knowledge"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sync more the one device.. What is the wrong with you?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using Evernote for years. Best Way to keep life organised."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not worth the $$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enshittification has never been so clearly exemplified, and they'll charge you $70 a year for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crazy that it doesn't even let you access your own data. This was one of the first note taking apps I used. At that time, it was good. Slowly they've tried to push its users into subscription. I can understand that, but the way they've done it is ridiculous. They first limited sync between two devices. Now it is limited to just one and you can't access notes (YOUR DATA) while that notification is there. Guess what, there is also a limit to how many times you can unsync."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm having to transfer all my notes out after the app has become nearly useable a few years ago. Constant pop ups to pay money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use this in highschool and for general thoughts and research, made over 400 notes, now I have to pay to make another note. I can't even open the app anymore without being bombarded by ads for paying more. What happened to this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Solía ser excelente pero ahora sí no pagas es horrible, hay anuncios en cada nota y te llena el correo de spam para que pagues, ni siquiera te deja usar las notas en 2 dispositivos a menos que pagues, realmente la versión gratuita es inútil"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now it won't let me in without paying a subscription, I already have quite a few notes on there that i need but now I can't even access those, it would have been nice to have been notified so I could at least retrieve my notes before being locked out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Such a disappointment! The app suddenly becomes paid app without a notice. And instead of grandfathering the old notes summerhouse they completely lock you our of the app unless you pay. I'm locked out of my own notes! I need to pay to be able to view my own notes!! That's crazy!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no longer works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's good but can often be better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access any of my notes due to the app wanting me to subscribe. Which really sucks because I have some important notes saved. I Reccomend downloading colornote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has really gone downhill, and i recommend NOT using this app to depend on keeping your notes safe. Use google keep instead. Its completely free and has given me ZERO issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote over the past few years, have removed functionality that I used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I just need an app to write down notes. Evernote is trying to do everything and it has ruined the basic purpose of its app by being so slow and unresponsive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Long time Evernote user (paid personal subscription) but the recently announced price increases just don't make it worth using for me anymore. Have found another alternative that is priced much more in-line with what one would expect for a simple note taking app, and the note migration process was seamless. I like Evernote for the most part but it has become bloated with features that I never use, and I can no longer justify the price they want for the features I do use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used the free for a long time. I purchased a subscription because it was heavily implied I could lose access to my notes that I had gathered over the years. The price has doubled and the bugs make it so I can't type. The screen freezes frequently. I also had one or 2 notes dissappear. The title is still there and I can see it the pinned section but when I open it, I keep getting an error message that says it's unavailable and to try again. The more the price rises, the more the problems"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not working, when I open rhe app I cant find my old nites and after 2 seconds the screen turn to black"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been with them since 2012 as paid plan, now they have significantly increased the price, so stopped the plan for coming and converted to up note app. So bad u guys"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been using on my phone daily for years this 5+ stars app, until the update on 5.Oct.23. Now it's so impractical to use and most functions now require few clicks instead of one (e.g. bulleting, tasks, colours etc.).... Most importantly, the app occasionally deletes the last few days of entries (the app's purpose), constantly creates duplicate notes, runs terribly slowly (both on the new and the old phone). It used to be the best notes app ever, now it's just irritating and a source of stress"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"What Bending Spoons is doing with Evernote is incredible! Please keep up the good work. Thank you all for your hard work!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I want to be optimistic. I've been with EN a long time. the app is mm~okay but they need faster cycle generation between updates and fixes. they are being left in the dust by competition. I've been paying for many years but I'm looking as some of the new apps and thinking about switching. I think EN was in the lead a long time ago and became complacent and did not keep pushing and they are really far behind now and I don't know if they can make it back into the race. I want my data safe. Go EN!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lapse in UI intuitiveness on clipping ... Sharing selected text prompts for a title but it never applies the defaults if none is entered... if you happen to just click 'save' without realizing, it just hangs. If the title was required why allow it to save in the first place?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote for years. This notebook was good 10 years ago, and has only improved & expanded the platform to great heights. The independent sync to multiple devices is the reason I started using Evernote. I have kept Evernote because of their innovation. They we doing it first before the well know giants made anything useful. The cost is worth every penny. As long as they don't jack up the fees. I subscribe to the annual play to save a few dollars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is very good, simple, if you sign in, you can extract or reload whats you already save in another phone also.. very easy and useful at the same time.. 👆This was my review in few years back, and give 5 stars . Now, after updating and it became more and more dufficult to take notes, if we put shirt cut, but it doea not show up. Difficult to handle, So, i give 2 Stars only. If it keeps going backwards like this, i will stop my subscription ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From five stars to one. There are other ways to make money other than cut the key functionality of your service. I know this happened a while back, but cutting access to creating new notes feels like blackmail without logical ways to export your data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's an amazing app have used since it existed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Limit Reached"" I wasn't aware that I was reaching a ""limit"" or I would have deleted things I didn't need. All of my information is held hostage - unless I subscribe. I can't even transfer info out. I've never been so unhappy with an app ...well, accept Pizza Hut, which is complete garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money hungry with their dark UX patterns."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"2024 Update 2. I complained about something and after some time, the issue was resolved. Yesterday I got a message telling me that premium will cost over 100k naira per year. Amazing. Do you guys know what's the minimum wage in Nigeria? This is me telling Evernote that our love dance will be ending soon. I'm transferring my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's too pricy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to rely on this app for all my notes since 2014. Now they have introduced a subscription paywall which has prevented me from seeing any of my notes unless I pay for their valueless subscription. Corporate hostage taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful. I've downloaded, used non stop, deleted & downloaded for around 10yrs. I want to learn to be a Blacksmith"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Took my money and now not giving me subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app throughout all my school years, and it has never let me down once. I highly recomend Evernote for easy note-taking! ☆"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editing sucks , regret bring premium member, Even basic things don't work properly Examples 1. if I press backspace key in my mobile , instead of deleting just last word - it deleted previous letter And cursor goes somewhere else 2. If u make bullet points , and start typing , and use backspace it's gonna give weird issue I do a hack post every bullet I put a space , any sensible text editor do these things properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app slow to load even when I have nothing wrote down in the notepad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I subscribed accidentally and then I request refund minutes after the subscription but then they're rejecting my request, I already emailed the app developer but they're not responsive. I didn't even used the app for once but here they are rejecting my request."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was one of the best apps in the world. I was an active evangelist and loyal user for more than 10 years. Now, Evernote just keeps getting worse and worse: it is now incredibly slow, buggier than ever, and technically behind much better alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but it is impossible to type a note with how glitchy it has become."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was once a useful app is now the most greedy, inconvenient money grab possible. No option for full purchase. Pay forever. Avoid at all costs!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once Evernote was a great app Now it's absolute garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"slow to load. need to update on every start"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everyday worst and worst, I can't access my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My ONLY (i.e. 1-star) issue with Evernote is ""Intellectual Property theft."" Once you have a threshold number of notes, and you stop paying for app, Evernote locks the app until you start paying again and you have 0% access to your notes until you produce that card. This practice is seriously unethical and abusive. Evernote needs to restrategize how they monetize their service, especially considering it's a digital product. Do not use this service long-term unless you can pay monthly/yearly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Left Evernote because it was glitchy. Made the mistake of coming back. Still glitchy. Reminders do not remind. If anyone knows of a GOOD note taking app I would love to know which."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a paid subscriber for years. They doubled the annual fee to $130 and pat themselves on the back for all the bloated add on features most people aren't using. Nope."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Sometimes, whenever I start typing on my android phone to add notes to a note, it just won't do anything. Nothing helps. Uninstalling, reinstalling the app, nothing. Google notes sucks too (entire notes randomly delete). Ugh why can't I find something that just allows me to take notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"On desktop, the app is great. On Android, it's really bad. Lots of weird keyboard issues where it doesn't let you type and the syncing of notes takes a long time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"nothing new, idk why they need subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"just 1 devices and can't shared anymore? ok 👌 uninstall it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using from 10 years. Last update made me to reduce another two stars since lot of issue to fix for free version. Desktop application getting crashed when i add more content to page. Please fix"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"100 dollars extra since last year's subscription?? you gotta be dreaming"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be such a great app across Android and Mac. Absolute schmozzle over recent years with broken features, price gouging old customers and finally they turned the android app into a joke. Moved to UpNote over a year ago and have zero drama since."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using this app for years.. The developers consistently roll out new features that enhances usability and keep things fresh. Also I would like to appreciate for the developers for keeping the security on top priority."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is laggy and it wont let me add tasks. Without writing desription to the task the accept-button does nothing and after writing description the button works but the task is still not added."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's still a usable app, but the subscription price is too much for me for the limited functionality. I'd rather move to google docs. Things to consider adding: Archive notes Add functions to spreadsheets"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app with great features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to use the app. Says there is an error in loging in and contact support. I tried uninstalling and installing again. No luck. Today I installed new update and it allowed me to reset my password. But again the reset url says invalid. And later today I again started getting the error in login."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've had evernote for a long time, used it to save notes for classes, home and work...thanks evernote😄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only want access to my info and it's forcing me to upgrade even though I am not adding new info. Limit reached should not mean you are robbed of your content."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"For me, this is a ""got to have"" requirement and solution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is free app before but now show that it was limit reached so we cannot see any note which we wrote before. CHEATING APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pocas opciones, mucha ""publicidad"" para comprar premium, las mensualidades son demasiado elevadas para lo que ofrece"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App made me update. Apparently they added a requirement where I have to sign in and pick a payment plan when before they did not. Lost all my notes. Screw these guys"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using Evernote for years and Now is the best Evernote ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Haven't used the app for about 3 years and thought I'd try it again. In the 2 minutes I was on it for I received no fewer than SIX popups asking me to subscribe. It's a shame as it used to be such a good app, but why would I pay to subscribe to a notes app when competitors offer them for free?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complete garbage wrapped up in a shell of greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was once the best for 10+ years. Now simple hyperlinks fail to work and I can't get support to respond. Looking to unsubscribe from Professional version and look for an alternative app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable and glitches several times after the update. Not to mention the stupid limit of 50 note and 1 notebook which is not a thing for any other note taking app to my knowledge. A limit to the number of notes? Really? And just 50?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Don't believe this is free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For a free piece of software to charge $160 is sure expensive, and not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app takes your data hostage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When opening shared notes, app keeps on crashing. Cleared cache, approved all permission, unrestricted battery usage, yet it persists. The development team should look into it or this would sadly be the end of the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be GREAT, but now...$$$$$$$$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Except for the purchase popup everything is fine. If that purchase popup didn't show up this frequently would have given 5 stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be nice just making simple notes but now they throw a billion and one adverts to buy some subscription with all these extra features and hide the cancel or x button. I just want a simple notepad. Stop spamming me for unneeded features to be purchased"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bombing with pop up upgrade account. Close, pop up again, i cant even do nothing. Time to unisntall this useless app. Just wasting space 4.3 rating for this app? What a joke."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's a good app. But it's very slow. Kindly sort out this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Çok kullanışlı uygulama şablonları çok güzel fakat bazen çok yavaş çalışıyor. Bilgisayarda vs çok yavaş açılıyor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever . I downloaded it and I couldn't even check it out. Within seconds it was asking for subscription saying the free limit was reached . It didnt even let me check the settings of the all nd took me to the subscription UI which cannot even be closed . It became very frustrating to a point i uninstalled it ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Previously, my default notebook was not syncing to the Android app. That has been fixed, thankfully."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Usual issue. Notes taking app but weirdly not typing after the update. In and out of when it wants to work and when it doesn't"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All good things come to an end. Was my go-to notes app for 7-8 years, before they made it pay-to-use. Absurd amount of money for deteriorating quality. I will stick to OneNote, no thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Why is it the app nolonger accepts screen shots"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware This was great as a free app which I used for passwords only. They then held my notes to ransom. I couldn't access any of them until I signed up to a paid subscription for way more than it's worth. Have signed up for one month to allow me to access and copy my passwords. will then cancel."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even attempting to open a note causes the app to crash (after update to version 10.110.1). Repeated ads. Clunky UI. I'm finally moving over to Joplin (FOSS) because I can't even look at my notes with this app anymore. Anyone that pays for this is getting ripped off & deserves better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is now becoming the most persistent in troubling every time with upgrade banners and unless we are keen to find escape to hit 'remind later' with more confirmations like Ke 'I am sure'. Thinking of switching to better alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editting to one star.. Price keep increasing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be a clean, lightweight notes system, good and helpful for so many things. Greed has made it worse and worse until it's basically become unusable. Can't open the app without being hassled to pay for something. Limits on how many notes you can make??? Limits on device installs?? Greedy and bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great for note taking. now it's unusable. They just endlessly try get money out of you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"indispensable app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes one notebook limit absolute joke. I've been using this app for so many years now and now they're telling me pay up or delete. It's like they're keeping my data for ransom because now I can't even access it if I don't pay up absolute garbage... And they have no easy way to get all your data off the app and somewhere where it can be stored locally at the bare minimum. And that's on purpose and why is it so ridiculously expensive? $15 or $17 a month. Not worth it, maybe $5 a month. Still.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For years, Evernote was clean, functional, and robust. It was my exclusive notes app for almost a decade. But unfortunately, it's become extremely buggy, limited, and greedy. Users are constantly harassed with pop-ups to pay an exhorbitantly expensive subscription for all but the most basic of features, and the selling point of cloud notes no longer applies to the free plan unless you unsync a device every time you open it on a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic experience. Can't access notes on web."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You're a note app. It's really not that difficult but somehow evernote archived to fumble this. You're not fast. You ask to pay for the bare minimum service that you provide."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is absolutely unacceptable the most important information I stored in this app, that is why I pay the premium and it failed me when I really needed it. How is this possible? Free apps are better than this. I pay premium for a simple note taking app and it doesn't work!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Haven't logged in for awhile and you generating a new account. Where is all my data?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A good App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the holy h*ll??? Decided to give it a try again. What a mess. I don't know what happened to this app but I had a horrible time logging in: didn't know who I was uding Google log in; had to reset my password; then I'm finally able to log in and I'm thrown into this loop of pop up ads, where I learn the app is no longer free. Don't bother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The aggressive upgrade ""offer"" has made the app unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This current version (android) is getting stuck in the initial loading screen, effectively cutting off access to any of my notes. Would be nice if that got fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to download this app ! Why??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You guys need to quit making so many changes. None of your changes have added any functionality. Now, you finally broke it. I cannot even enter text in notes anymore. Developers are really good at making a nice functional app and then finding ways to destroy it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now buggy as h3ll"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nags for subscription right from the go. No usable free tier whatsoever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app ever. It keeps forcing you to buy. I had to end up deleting 100's of notes which I had for over 10 years. I lost all my work. Dont download it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I downloaded Evernote hoping for a seamless note-taking experience, but honestly, it’s been a letdown. The interface is clunky and unintuitive, and syncing between devices is slow and unreliable. I’ve had multiple instances where notes I updated on my phone didn’t sync to my laptop, causing a lot of frustration. The free version is very limited, and to get any real value, you have to pay for the premium subscription, which feels like a bit of a cash grab. Overall, the app is more trouble than it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was one of my favorite app. Was okay when they went to a pay model. Then the price went up significantly per month and the quality went down. App is barely functional and more frustrating than useful. I've moved to OneNote and cancelled my Evernote subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like this application it seems to do everything that it says it does and has lots of options more than the average one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When basic functionality (adding links doesn't work now) is broken why would I pay for features that used to be free? I'm looking elsewhere for a note app. Goodbye, probably forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is Evernote suddenly not opening? I enter my passcode, and I get a blank white screen. What's going on Removing Evernote for not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Becoming bulkier, and glitching more and more as time goes on. Search results are a hit or miss now. Whole point is lost on this app. Even Web interface has become slow and glotchy and heavy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now, time to leave past behind with so many restriction in free version, it hangs and can not do anything much everything you open it forces us to upgrade. I have been with them since 2008 and loved it, and now I am getting annoyed and forced to move to Google Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote got clunky, overpriced & bloated. I use Google Keep exclusively now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"RUN!!! I tried to cancel my subscription and it was like a maze. Horrible! There is no chat, email, or phone number to reach them-now I know why! Non-existent communication! Seriously awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's gotten better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has made it clear that they will only let you actually use the app if you pay $75/yr. Constant pop ups harassing you to purchase the plan and now only one device can be used at a time. They are taking away more and more features and charging more for it. Completely unusable now where it used to be the best note taking app. Annoying that I'll have to migrate everything off of it but anything is better than this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a shame, New owner became greedy. Change the format, eliminating features systematically, trying to appeal to new users and compete with others apps. I know it's needed to add new features but at what cost; using the if you don't like it, you can leave attitude; so I decided to leave. Paying customer for many years, recommended to many coworkers and friends during the years but no more. Make my notes available in any media with hi quality pictures. Also, can share it with others."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notebooks & notes from years ago are now behind a paywall & I can't even create any new notes or notebooks without paying an overpriced monthly fee. WHY WOULD I PAY MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT I USED TO GET FOR FREE?! THIS IS DISGUSTING LEVELS OF GREED. DO MOT SUPPORT THIS APP UNTIL THEY FIX THEIR PRICING SYSTEM!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems to have changed to the point where it is useless without a subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the app since 2013 it has generally worked well. I can no longer type more than a few characters in my notes. It just freezes. I've deleted the app and reinstalled the latest version but it still doesn't work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gets slower every year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Recent update is causing app to crash. Also the subscription prices are unbearable with Indian economic conditions"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's making me pay for a subscription, and there is no way to exit out of it. It says that I've reached some sort of a limit and doesn't give any other information."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't understand why I cannot select which photo is used as the thumbnail for my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is good but it hangs a lot the options take too much time to open and to gett applied it makes me sickkk.... Do something for thisss."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"As the app has got more complicated... simple features do not work at times... - Will not let me copy and paste text - Will not enter what I'm typing Have to keep closing / opening to get it to work Not sure what else I can do to fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Edit: Changing my review from 5 to 2. Remember guys, this app first let you invest in note making and then it starts asking for premium to even access your created notes. Imagine asking premium JUST FOR THE TEXTS in this 21st century. What a pathetic scam from such a reputable company. Never gonna trust them again. Good bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app. I use it to organise, record and collate everything. I particularly enjoy the transcribe function. Being able to take a picture of my notes and turn them into text is brilliant - and honestly, if Evernote can cope with my handwriting it can cope with anything! Worth the price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has completely lost sight of the plot. Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years. But suddenly it's getting worse and worse. Updates make my phone slow and it takes time to access this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it's great but it's expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Cannot connect. Keeps sending me in a cycle of deleting a synced account but won't delete. Keeps prompting me tonmake a purchase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wouldn't let me see notes I had, said I had to subscribe. I've used this app for years on and off, and now you hold my notes for ransom. I would have subscribed if you had allowed me to access my original notes and made me get a subscription for new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely buggy and slow on Android. Bending Spoons doesn't really care about Android users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app locked me out of something like 3 notes that I've had since before they went premium. Ridiculous. I can only access them for a split second before I'm blocked by pop-ups telling me I need to pay for access. This used to be the best note app on android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"TRASH IS AN UNDERRATED WORD"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly don't know why this was recommended by anyone, it harasses you constantly for an expensive subscription that adds nothing you can't get for free elsewhere and it's infuriating. Stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My partner loves it, finds it very useful. I find it clunky and cumbersome. Not intuitive, and much less useful for simple writing tasks, I prefer notepad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be a fantastic app. You could do a search on it and what you were searching for turned yellow and it scrolled straight to it now you have to go through and find it. It's glitchy not what it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've made it impossible to log into my account on a new phone, wow. All they do is add features while the core experience sucks too. Evernote is absolute garbage these days."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's horrible now. I used the paid version for years to avoid stupid adds. Now, I can't even type a note without freezing every few words. It started a few updates ago, now is a lot worse. Need to cancel, I don't care if I lose all my notes. App is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Early adopter of evernote. Loads of **much** better options. Backing up my data and deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To be able to write or read a simple note, every time I have to go through a long process of closing the Evernote advertisments. They push it so much to convince you to get premium that it gets frustrating. Finally today, after many years,I convinced myself to save those few notes somewhere else and uninstall this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"large store as apl drive support memory in device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't be dissatisfied enough, deleted years of work for what?! For what ?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used this app for years and every year it somehow outdoes itself in becoming shittier and more expensive. good job tanking your app. im porting over to another free notes app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once great, now it's uneuseful! So many annoying adds and it is not even possible to use it on phone and computer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be an Awesome app! Now, I can't even access any notes unless I pay for a subscription! This app is not even as good as Samsung Notes. With the Samsung Note app you can password protect any note! Genius! Boo Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Alright. I get it. You gotta make your money, and I use to use Evernote when I needed it. After the new updates, you are bombarded with a million and 1 pop-ups for premium, and made to jump through 10 million hips of kicking offers away to do the simplest of things. Hell, running a 2 minute ad would be a hundred times better, whoever is running the team needs to be seriously fired."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had a lot of information on this app when it was free. All of my documents and pics are gone. Evernote is asking for an unreasonable fee. It doesn't say if I will get my former information back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Up until today only problem with free was limite to how many notes you can do , however today without adding any notes it says limit reached have deleted 5 notes with no change cannot open app for more than 3 seconds without a payment screen opening cannot copy data when it is open for a few seconds each time you backspace out of payment screen and no complant function to access .keel getting messages from my complaint that are unrelated or useless as cannot go to settings for 1 second then kick"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was one of the best of its kind. Unfortunately the new version ruined the app. The screen loads way too long, therefore if you want to make a quick note - forget about it... There's no widgets anymore, so no way to add a note to the home screen. It's very slow and laggy to the point that I prefer to use my pre-installed note pad. And the list goes on and on. Subscribing was only a waste of money so I cancelled. Now I have no access to any of my notes...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote back when I installed it about 8ish years ago. It was a great program, allowed for a lot, and worked well. Overtime greed has gotten the best of them, though, and now you're barely allowed to do anything with the program. They restrict everything you do, the amount of devices you can have active at a time, and about 2 to 3 pop ups everytime you open the program. Back in the day I would of paid for it, but not anymore. I'll just look for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for almost years. It went from being great to now totally unusable. They force you to upgrade to the paid version by constantly blocking your screen with upsell offers that you can't get past unless you pay with a credit card. There are many other note-taking apps now, so I've been migrating all of my Evernote notes, etc, over to another app that is totally free and works great. Evernote has lost another 20-year customer!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I thought this was free. I saw free advertisements on Instagram, but when I installed it, it asked for a subscription. Every time I open the app, a pop-up appears asking to buy. I don't like this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complete Rubish since new updates and sync limits and stupid pops and interruptions. This App used to be great but I am now uninstalling and moving all my content to Samsung Notes and deleting my account. Stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"cool app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dont ever think about trusting or using this app. They let you use it for a while for free, you enter information crucial for you in it, then one day they block it asking you to pay to reach your own data! Without paying premium you cant reach your own data anymore! How worse can this get? Zero stars given."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be a model notetaking and note organizing app, it used to be my go-to-app for everything organization, with it I couldnt flirt with other apps having similar properties and features. But now, reverse is the case. It has become a most stressful app. Buggy, heavy, somewhat dull, incrementally costly, not offline friendly, power consuming, amongst others. Evernote, let me breathe, abeg! 😤 Cant do this anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Downgraded my rating. Mobile app is still a decent performer. Windows desktop version is now bloated and slow with unnecessary features. Starting to look elsewhere. Edit: Moved to OneNote. Satisfied, wish I had done it sooner."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app offers a one week free trial, and isn't up front that they will take $210 from your account after one week...not just an additional 1 week charge. I caught it before they scammed me, but many others probably don't. Evernote - forgetting to cancel does not mean we want to put braces on your CEO's kids' teeth. Very inappropriate charge."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too expensive, but I have so many years of notes I cant give it up until I input into another program."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Drink battery juice much, garbage muncher?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Has been with this application for years. Very usefull and easy to operate. I'm doing my job better. But today I disappointed due to theres is no plan for free. You force us to pay otherwise I can not use the application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not good anymore. Impossible to do anything with all the pop up ads for subscriptions ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You ruined the app. I finally updated and stuff is missing. And I can't even use the app without paying because I have so much on there from using it for over 10 years. Not happy at all and a huge portion of notes from this year is gone. F U!!! I will be figuring out how to download all my notes and never use this app again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Directly asked to subscribe to a paid plan, no free option available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"sucks lately. Web client is buggy. slow. have used for years but had been rough of late."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free version is now completely useless. Between no device syncing and endless popups, you're better off opening up a draft email on Gmail for your notes. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The highest state of capitalism is when they force you to pay for something that was already free, my dad told me to use this app because it can keep my notes save by using a password or code and now even i can't get to my notes without have to pay $5 a month and I'm not even american, after i pay this subscription for a month i'll copy every data from my account and then cancel my subscription after i'm done because i ain't gonna use this app anymore and won't recommend anyone to download it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can I just write a note without 5 ads popping???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great and useful tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to pay to review notes!? Thats insane i rather use a regular notebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"so disappointed with this app. after having supported it in its initial times where i paid fees for it and made lots of notes using it, they kept all of the sudden chasing me to subscribe for periodical fees! after refusing, they shut it down for me!! all my notes are gone now. This is modern Piracy!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app occasionally ( had a free account ) and had quite a few notes ( some important ones ) saved in it. All of a sudden I see a premium wall in front of me and can't access even my free account ( and they did this without even informing the users beforehand ). And the pricing is just plain extortion. Worst experience regarding a note taking app. Well EVERnote .... goodbye forEVER. PS :- Guys.... just go for colornote / google keep notes / Microsoft one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT SIGN UP. I used to worship this App. It's now crazy expensive for a low quality painfully slow experience. On my tablet it won't allow offline notes and it's practically unusable. I had to pay 50euro get back in after the pricing changed. I'll extract what I need hand cancel. Extremely disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, now they've turned into greedy subscription hounds like all of the rest."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really disgusting that keep prompting for subscription, that makes me to quit this app for other better noting platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a free user since 2012. The new monetization efforts have made the app unusable. From constant, difficult to skip offers/adds, preventing me from taking a quick not or making a quick reference, to just general functionality lacking. Not allowing me to complete words in a list for example. I'm uninstaling, just m9ved everything to Google keep for now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I user this for years initially fully free came with an old phone. Now UI is garbage, their pop ups and predatory subscription model is absolutely horrid. If you wanna pay a crazy amount for a notepad that sucks, this is your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"works well most of the time, but I hate how files get lost and things don't upload if you have poor signal. it should store the information and upload it when service is better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app has gotten steadily worse overtime. It used to be great for quick snappy organization even the free version. But now there are constant pop ups and interruptions. The limitations have ramped up and now I can't even log in to get my data back after changing phones. Huge drop in quality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for quite some time now. It used to be a favorite app of mine with rich features. But, over time, it has become a money grabber. Taking away most of the great features and asking me every time I login to pay a large amount for the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is always big purchase banner at bottom it's irritating avoid this app do not install this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am highly disappointed with this app! I cannot access information or photos that I have saved without having to pay....which stinks!⁴"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"non-stop notifications which can't be turned off or ""marked as read"" ""selling"" their new features. users have to click on every one. hard to manage the new Mac interface and simply get to the notes you want."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years, now it's impossible to use unless you buy it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Features which are previously free, are now paid ones. It is sad that this is the route being taken for the Evernote app, instead of developing new features. There are other apps which are now better options than Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a paid user. Worst experience yet. Cannot even type a single note. Whenever i type anything, the keyboard closes automatically or i cannot add more than 3 characters. I am cancelling my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have used this App for years and love it! It is always my go-to when I need to remember something important. Easy to use. That said, I am NOT at all happy to hear about the outrageous price increase planned for next year (from $94.49 to $172.99!!!). The price being charged now is reasonable, but not the price increase. I'm not sure that I would continue to use this App next year if it becomes so unreasonably priced!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app, bad experience. Fraud"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I Love it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"too slow loading when opening app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Consistently requests to upgrade while operating like garbage. Tried logging in and they have went from a free ap to paid ap without informing anyone; I am unable to attain any documents/notes because of this. Users are NOT able to login to get documents. This ap should be removed from marketplace. There is no customer service or support from developers / site. STAY AWAY"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tons of pop-ups asking you to upgrade. Free plan allows sync on only 1 device and Evernote on the web counts as 1. So it makes Evernote completely pointless if you can't access it from somewhere else for free. Astonishing. Their web editor has been updated in 2024, and it feels like we went back in time 15 years. Yuck. Seriously, Evernote is at its worst it's ever been. Use something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly fails at the basics of what it needs to do... it won't let me type, literally! I am pressing letters on the keyboard, and nothing shows up. I copy something, and it cuts it instead, I have lost entire notes due to this. I am very close to deleting the app... I have been using it for years and have a ton of valuable notes, im worried they will just disappear... lowered review to 1 star.... I can't even type an entire word into a note without encountering an issue! So frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Strange app without payment. You can't see even see the app futures."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Says I am paying for a subscription through GP, but I have NOTHING listed in my subscription list and am unable to cancel account. Customer service is unresponsive, but yet they love taking my money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"issues with login. irritating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"POS. Doesn't even stay logged in. no pricing plan tier offered $179 annually, so many complaints on upgrades being offered at 59.00 annually."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be good until they changed the format and is very slow now and way too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I wish I could say something positive. My experience with this app up until I suppose it was bought out (?) was positive, but now the app harasses me to subscribe to a payment plan multiple times and makes the app extremely frustrating to use. I'll be taking the notes I've made so far and transferring them elsewhere asap so I don't have to deal with the irritation anymore!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Continuous banners to buy premium. And the pricing is ridiculous too. Barely usable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great ten years ago, now I'm migrating all of my old notes out of there I just downloaded it and within 1 minute, I've had 3 different popups that kept pushing me to upgrade my plan. You can only say no so many times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version use to be great, now they've bottlenecked so much! Why not just make the app better and offer more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"March 7, 2022: loved it but it's gotten bad with the update. can't edit a note real fast now as the app gets laggy. issue's def not on my phone but on the app. still using it tho, hoping the issue gets fixed. Edit: You are of no use to me anymore. After an update on the app, some updates I knew I added on my oldest notes got randomly removed. Cannot view individual note edit history. Just got stupider. Thank you for all 8 years, still! ❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth the money they want to use features,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most frustrating app, whenever I am trying to create account cause I am first time user, it's just popping up login page interface. Totally waste of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote, your ethics stink. You offered a free product and then put the squeeze on me over the years by limiting features and ultimately locked me out. I was an occasional user and was locked out when I repeatedly accessed a checklist note for an upcoming trip. You got a couple of the $14.99 per month payment while I moved my information, but this product is in no way worth $150 per year (or more). Due to bad ethics, I will never use a Bending Spoons product again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been my long-time note-taking and thoughts organizing app for all aspects of my life. It's been really useful - though I am sure that I am not taking advantage of all of the features that have been added over time!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is nothing like it used to be years ago. I've been using it since 2008, but now it's just no good anymore. Iv also had many files completely disappear from my saved list. Anything controversial saved was scrubbed. It was the best app around, now I won't even use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"How am I supposed to move to a new phone if only one device can be""synced""?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update on 20241001 Not able to access all of my past notes unless I subscribe on a monthly basis! I could not retrieve any of my notes at all. Please help!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Short version: My favourite free app once. Now the free version has bugs and you have to pay a lot of money to sync just 2 devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"doesnt even sign in on my chromebook. absolutely useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Pretty good all round. I had some notes recorded of sensitive conversations that were deleted by Evernote because of some expletives within. This needs to be raised with the user rather than censoring what I record. Otherwise, a sound app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use it for everything 9/30/24 update I've used Evernote for well over a decade (with at least 10 years on a paid level). I love certain aspects of it but for 6 months now, it freezes as I'm typing and won't let me add anything unless I click on a different line....then it might but only for a few characters. Happens most often when doing lists. Super frustrating when the most basic function no longer works. Bending spoons has not been good to what used to be the best simple note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please delete this money grab notepad wanabe 😭🙏🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now it's a disgustingly greedy cash grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Number one killer app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"skip"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to be good. Now it just asking you to buy plan every time I open up. Very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Used 10 years for everything I want to remember, save or organize, personal and work. Past few years (new ownership) app just keeps getting better. Very easy to add notes by email forward, web clipping, camera, etc., save to chosen notebook and pretag. Good filtering to refine search when needed, but usually simple text search finds what I want fast. New formatting lets me collapse parts of long notes & easily reorder multi-level checklists. Love new Code Block syntax format for my HTML & VB."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2022..$36/yr 2023..$56/yr 2024..$145/yr Wow, really? $145 USD/yr??? With all of the updates, Your app is not even that good to be charging that much money. I canceled my subscription!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What features are premium? Ads say premium features are free... It is bare bones and every few clicks I get a premium purchase screen thrown in my face. Uninstalled immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It should be listed as paid app to begin with. After registration and everything on landing page it details out about being paid. Waste of time and effort"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"price is too high for indian users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app.. uninstalling 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They lack customer service. Need billing help? Good luck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant pestering to subscribe. Have migrated to a different app and will uninstall Evernote. RIP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hangs often and took away my money but didn't upgrade, no response on complaints even after 2months"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Yes, it's free--if you don't mind being harassed every time you use it with an ""upgrade offer."""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying that people I share with have to pay. I'll be cancelling my subscription soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Suddenly I'm paying for this app and I've always only used the free version. I've encountered issues trying to change it back to free. it appears they've charged me for a few months now through Google play. I never agreed to a subscription. I'm not sure if this happened as an accident. either way I can't seem to rereverse it. I'd like someone to get ahold of me. please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was unaware I would not be able to get to any notes without paying for the app. I have lost important things. I am sorry I ever used this app because I am not going to pay for this when I was not made aware I had a limit of usage as I have used this app for years! Fail"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great value add"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to pay for everything!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login... Broken..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app has gone downhill.. I have to log back in regularly and when editing tick lists the app behaves erratically. Please sort it out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep crashing when I opened a non-downloaded note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved the app when I started using it but now it's constantly syncing and everything has been monetized. This syncing disrupts the typing with keypad disappearing every time. Adding to this, everytime I switch notes, there's a reminder to upgrade the app which is pathetic & there's no option to close it. The functions are very very slow which decreases the writing speed. Besides, what's this new limit on devices, it's a basic thing to access it on atleast 2 devices. You just lost a user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, now too expensive, and can't determine how to change to monthly payments, or if get refund if you have paid yearly and cancel before year end. Your note not available fix isn't fixed at all. Very disappointed. Have used you since 2013."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a really good app. Then the UI changes were awful, and the free functions of the app all became pushed to subscription. It's now a useless app for free, and the subscription option isn't worth it IMO. I'll go back to organizing everything myself and deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a paid customer of Evernote for FOURTEEN YEARS. I get an email from Google Play stating Evernote is increasing my annual subscription. I looked at the rate and it's DOUBLED in cost. I contacted their customer support and their reply was ""maybe it will be easier on you if you pay monthly."" Rather insulting. They just lost a long time, loyal customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incessant pop-ups and eventually will block your access to important notes with a subscription wall. Do not install/use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today i cannot login into my notes in browser on android phone and in the browser on windows laptop. Is it new limitation fof free version? Support team is here?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"None of the features are free anymore, you're seriously telling me that one needs to pay to use a notes app? Corporations' greed knows no boundaries."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the app for years, but the constant bombardment of ads to sign up for premium as driven me to uninstall. Moved to OneNote where i don't have to deal with that every time I open the app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app. It's now messy to use, and takes about 3 minutes to get into the app as it shows pop-up after pop-up trying to get you to pay full price. I used to pay, until they started making changes that makde it hardwork and unpleasant to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's crazy how much money they are asking for this relatively simple notepad app. Yes it has some extra functionality, with various bugs especially on the desktop version, and how much they force you to start paying. I installed because it was recommend to me, probably it was better in the past but I've had nothing but bad experiences, like losing data, sync issues, and layout struggles. This app is done for time to move on to so something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Less service more costly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Auto rotate issue since 2020: Q: I have rotation lock activated but Evernote disregards the setting. Even my screen is set to stay vertical if I tilt it - evernote flips to horizontal. How can I set Evernote to not rotate the screen when screen lock is activated? A: There is no setting that fixes this; Evernote staff are aware of the problem; they seem to have other priorities at the moment; the workaround is to close Evernote from the Recent Apps and restart it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Look at all the 1 star reviews and the arrogant new owners don't even address them like a professional would. I have the paid subscription and I cannot access notes on my damn phone which negates the purpose of having Evernote doesn't it. Give it a sway of everybody there's got to be a better alternative to this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop asking for premium subscription every time i open the app, so annoying. Uninstall this thrash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I deleted my former review of 2 stars to make this now one star. Evernote used to be a decent app that I paid for in the past. Now that I've decided to not pay for it, the desktop version WON'T EVEN LET ME ACCESS ANY OF MY NOTES!!! Whoever is reading this at Evernote needs a reality check. Evernote went from a company that had a good product to a company with a garbage product that is slow to load even small jpegs. I will export my notes whenever I can access them and leave for good. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"where is the free version? I have stuff stuck in Evernote now I need but don't have money for the subscription at the moment"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App's horrid, better to use your free note app. Forcing your users into a subscription plan will kill you eventually after taking away access to our notes that for some, have been there for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally begging for subscription. After every action, the app is begging to purchase the subscription. Pathetic app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greediness kills it. A big thumbs down 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"9/27/24 - App crashes every time I search for a note and click on the search result. Happens on two different Pixel 8 devices. 5/30/22 - Since I first reported the freezes when opening notes larger than 100kb back on 10/15/21, I've communicated with support who have acknowledged the issue and still no fix has been implemented for Android. It's starting to feel like the issue may never get resolved, and I'm curious about other not taking options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"damn app is expensive smallest 4.99$ per week was a great app years ago but you should review your price 209.00 a year!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Liking the app again. However, the web version seems to have an issue. Have tried three different browsers and getting the same bouncing icon when trying to load, and it never does. So no web access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"9/27/24 Here to publicly document what Evernote is doing as to persuade potential users to steer clear. Evernote has now basically set up a hostage /ransom situation whereby BASIC users are denied access to their notes in the app unless they pay for a regular membership... Accounts are being locked. This is really illegal as Basic service was set up as free and now personal information of users is locked. It's false advertising at the least and probably violation of other commerce law."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not at all responsive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it was great. now it sucks - and gets worse with every upgrade and price hike. customer support is a black hole. just no."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Реклама на каждом экране! Это просто невозможно дальше использовать."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now you have to pay for everything, you can't even sync your phone with the web version without paying so it's completely useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Pretty good app. I would like to buy premium at the very attractive discount it keeps offering me, but as soon as I go to the page and link my PayPal the price changes to be a lot higher than in the original offer. I tried doing this multiple times, but it keeps reverting to the bigger, unattractive amount"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Стали очень жадными. Невозможно работать. Почти после каждого действия вылезает реклама с предложением купить платную версию. При этом оплату не принимают, а функциональность базового приложения все ниже и ниже. Не рекомендую начинать пользоваться, если только выбираете приложение для заметок"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recent update crashes when opening notes with embedded graphics in them. Until I make them available offline (i.e. download them). Poor show."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before they let you create notes until it gets to 60mb/month. Now you can't create any note without paying lol. Therefore the free version is useless. I don't want it for free but the amounts they're asking is too much... monthly / yearly. And still is clunky after all these 10 years it's not snappy at all like some others out there, even on my flagship smartphone. Too bad though because I got familiarized with it. I'm taking my info somewhere alse. companies need to learn. only for rich country"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Simply doesn't start. Spipinnig logo is al it can do."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"have been using for many many you ears"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why should I pay for Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"These apps were great back in the day, now that they are limiting everything and asking for money, they are useless garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bye bye Evernote. Used to be the best. Now, the developers are too desperate to make money that existing free users are not even allowed to revisit their past notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very Evil thing.. Now the free user are not even allowed to search and see own notes... It is ok if u don't allow to create new notes but to not allow to even search and see own old notes is very brutal and evil... If I had known this before would have never used evernote... When I try to search and read my notes it messages limit reaches and forces to subscription page... Pls remove this forceful behaviour..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Day by day developer at BS increasing difficulty for free user, why not they just say pay and use. Earlier 50 notes restriction but I think that is not required becz you already limited the monthly storage so we can't store much. Now only one device login at a time. One day I will decide to leave till then trying to go through these annoying note limit reached popup."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Its better in the past, but now I think, this become worst, or it's just me?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor development !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good. Now it's SUPER laggy and they spam you asking for you if you want premium. Going to phase it out and delete it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently when I made notes it was always on the state of uploading. So there were like 6 months of notes were not uploaded successfully, I thought it was ok because every time I opened the app they were there. Yesterday the app suddenly updated itself and all those 6 months notes were gone! Those were important notes. Possible to get them back ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is nothing to the ""free"" version. Not even sure what the free version entails. Only saw 7 day free trial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm having a technical issue but it won't allow me to submit a problem. Keeps telling me to attach an activity log, which I have. So there's a bug in their 'report a problem ' function! Maybe this will get their attention!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Welcome to Evernote. Can you please pay us now? Okay, you want to write a note, can you please pay us first? Oh great, you want to sign up for a subscription to unlock more features and stop our annoying prompts? Awesome, but don't you want to upgrade now? How about now. Oh you locked your screen then came back to the note you had open, but first, could you pay us more!!!??? F this app. Uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have good feature options but the application literally crashed after 2 hours of one single use...after making 10 task at a time for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow with reminders, all of them got vanished! it didn't even push notifications! however, its a high featuring app that holds loads of option which other applications doesn't even have...but its not working well which make it less useful..please kindly fix the rotation prob as well...then this app will be reallygood to go! thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why does this have auto rotate built in? Can i turn it off? Slow loading speed and response"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a horrible user experience trying to login and delete my Evermore account. Sooo much unnecessary verification, verification, and verifying again and again and again! These developers have no clue how to have a user identify and verify one time and then reuse that authentication."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for ages. All my important notes are there, and now it says limit reached, and they want me to pay a huge amount of money just to access my notes. They are manipulaters and Exploiters.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience, app fails to load my previous notes and there are non stop pop up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Please make it so I can put wiget page as very first or add favorite or star mark note category tap under menu."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is more better than expected"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was best now worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bilkool bekar hai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used for years and like the functionality"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for 10+ years, mostly for lists and notes. Tried to open it today and it seems that my notes are being held hostage until I sign up for a 14.99/mo subscription. Not happening. I'll either find something else or go back to pen & paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a user of Evernote since 2015. Ever since they started jacking up prices, locking down functionality, and adding bloat/popups/ad bloat, I've been using it less and less. At this point, there is no reason to keep using Evernote, it is not worth it. Now I'm unable to get my data out of the app without paying. Don't let these guys hold your data hostage, move to an app that respects you, your time, and your data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How the mighty have fallen. Like the other long time users here have said already, this once reliable note taking app became exorbitantly greedy with the subscription model. Over time, they kept cutting back features and charging more. Do yourself a favor, and get another note taking app. Evernote = trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review (1 star): The constant pop-ups trying to get you to upgrade to a paid version are annoying as hell and were the main reason I started looking for alternatives. Original review (2 stars): Give us the option to disable swiping right to close a note. Too many accidental note closures happen because of this function. I'm sure you implemented it as a convenience, but it has turned out to be a big headache."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Glitch in free version- you can only have 50 notes for free. Well I have now deleted 4 notes (I have 46) and have reloaded the app as well as logged out and back in and it still will not let me create any new notes. Please fix this glitch!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nevernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My free trial ran out, and they're holding my notes hostage. I can't see them or extract them in any way. What a terrible practice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app says I've reached the free limit, which is, I guess, fine. But it doesn't allow me to access my notes covering it all with a banner. This is, to put it simply, offensive. Especially with the fact that I wouldn't be able to pay even if I wanted to, it's absolutely impossible for me to access the Google payment system."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever. Each little action demands you to upgrade the app, i cant even open my notes and copy them so i can use another app. Its so frustrating. Worst notes app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's really sad way to treat your loyal long term users. Even if you were going to go subscription-based after years of allowing us ise the app without subscription, youbshould have at least given an option where we se able to access our old notes and subscribe for any new notes. The sudden cut off is bad and can only mean a drastically drop in review. I hope you guys at Evernote reconsider your strategy and put your past, current and potential users first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Bizarre problem where a lot of letters I type simply aren't appearing/getting input into the app's text editor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I did not like the app asked for a subscription even though I had not even tried it. I like the idea of trying an app before I spend my hard earned money on a subscription. It makes me want to use it and not waste the money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is trying to force me to pay to access my existing notes. I can't even see them without paying. Bit of a ransom approach to forcing users to subscribe to the paid plan, after years of using it as a basic (but free) note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I liked this app so much a few years ago. It really felt like I had a notebook on my smartphone/tablet and synced with the laptop. It was great for studying and writing thoughts. But now is everything paid in the app. I understand that some functionalities can be paid to support the app costs. But the general quality of the app is decreased now. I saw bugs, crashes, and some screens flickering. Good bye, Evernote. :/"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too many limitations within the free plan:("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy Pay walls Used it for years, would've been happy to pay if it was reasonable, but they manipulate you into relying on the app then you have to pay by locking your notes away. Cosa nostra style"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the worst app in the world of play store even"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a scam!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not easy to search and find. It use to highlight the word I searched."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would have given -5 stars but the option is not available. Firstly misleading ad claiming that the app is free. After installation there is no free version available. Constant torture for payment. I opted to disconnect my devices but after selection there is no further option. The app also crashes frequently. I am using inkpad notepad since 10 years and it is the best note app ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app still auto rotates. This is getting very troubling. Please fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app, but they destroyed it and turned it into an app full of bug"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App don't open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm convinced that there's not a single user at bending spoons that's actually using this product. Bugger then the Arctic in summer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved it for years, was happy to pay for a plan to express my appreciation even though I only used the most basic functions. Then came a price increase of 600%. 600%! Goodbye Evernote, it's been fun but now you're just being ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed experience as it always pop's up with premium version ads. First atleast let me check out the app and then I'll decide if I want to even purchase this premium plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have priced themselves out of the market. I'd pay $36-60/year, but not $169/year. You can get Microsoft 365, which includes all the office apps, plus a note taking app (OneNote) for $120/year. I'll be looking for a replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the app lightly, most of my notes are obsolete but some of them contain useful information. And guess what happened lately? They force the upgrade to paid option. Now I cannot even get access to my notes so I can pull the data out of the app or delete some notes to comply with 50 notes limit. Too bad. I wouldn't recommend to use the app to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good and worth having but has become Massively overpriced. Some significant formatting issues. Slow to open and plenty of other issues. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app I've ever seen, if i want to rotate my screen i would just do it by control panel, why would you do it and also no option to turn it off. When i paste huge no. of words it loads like internet explorer, worse than that. Unreliable ui, strucks too much like my inbuilt notes app is far better. Go for notion instead of this 💩"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years with no probs, suddenly features were restricted to only premium, had to log off my phone bc I couldn't be logged in 2 devices not being premium and decided to make a second account to keep writing and before I could I could no longer get into the app no matter the times uninstalled or deleting the data. Terribly disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every new version introduces new bugs and reduces functionality. Wouldn't be surprised if they started charging by number of notes used or word count."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The apps is riddled with pop up notifications prompting you buy a premium subscription which is insanely overpriced. In a world where alternatives like obsidian and notion exists evernote is a terrible option to go for taking personal notes"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The perfect cross-platform note-taking tool. I use it more than 7 years and its still great!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this used to be a great product but you keep making it clunkier and less reliable. for this whole year, the notes on my laptop have not been accessible when I don't have an internet connection and your tech support didn't help at all. one of the biggest reasons for Evernote was having things synced across machines but having hard copies for when I don't have access which is often. you really really badly need to debug this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's getting worse in my device (zenfone 8). I can't even use it anymore because it always stopping or crashing after few seconds opened. The hell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Android app now crashes on opening notes on Android 14. Luckily the web app works OK as does the version I use on my laptop. An immediate fix please?"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am being extorted to pay. App was good since I initially gave it a five star. I subscribed to a free account since I only use the app for personal use and hardly ever use it. Now I tried to log in and and my data is locked. I'm being told to pay in order to view my few personal files. I was never told this would happen. I tried getting support and it's useless. Do not use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use the app a lot but found it useful at times. Now I cannot read or even look at my notes because I'm not willing to pay. Deleting the app all together and going to find another option. Very disappointing that I can't even see my notes to transfer them to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aim of this app is only money..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have not had many technical issues with recent updates, but the price hike is a little insane to me. Most likely will only use this until I find a replacement. Sad, I really enjoyed the app and from my experience over the last several years, it used to be much more about their users and not greed 😞"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is quite good and useful but there are so many types of problems. I created notes and tasks but the next time i open my app, all of them for some reason vanish away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good app, almost great, except for this one REALLY annoying thing. I use the app on my phone (Android) A LOT. I often need to switch between Evernote to other apps. When I do, it puts me back on the app home page causing me to have to navigate back to the note I was looking at. This happens Every. Single. Time. I'll be at the grocery store trying to toggle between the store app and my recipe in Evernote and it's impossible. Fix this and I'll happily give the app 5 stars!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app ! Would surely recommend you this ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash app that has too many limitations"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best. But day by day, Evernote becomes unreliable. Glitches, malfunctions, and very slow. The price is too high. I can obtain 100GB of file storage from Google Drive or OneDrive in just $2 per month. Why note taking app costs $10 - $20 per month? If it were the best, but the situation of the app and its price is not fair now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Decided to try after seeing ads and reviews were correct, 5 mins in and I already can't access it on the browser and it's stuck on Save logs page Can't even delete my account here"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They limit the device that can be sync on free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything was good until new update. After update it is not even allowing me to access my old data. Previously saved data is locked until I purchase a new plan. Worst tactics."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bsdk they tell that it's free but they charge 5000 scammers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All paid now. Can't access my existing notes without a paywall I can't get past without paying. Says ""limit reached"" but I can't find what I already had FOR YEARS. Update: I was finally able to access my notes by disabling one device. I then went through them and emailed them (one by one) to myself. I'm going to uninstall this app and find another."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently, it takes ages to sync. I used to use it for quick notes and to-do lists (for years!), which is currently impossible. I cannot wait for 15 minutes to check my to-do list :("

The cursor just blinks until I move it and bring it back to where I want to type. Even then, I can only type one letter at a time. Don't waste your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user, just manually copied/pasted my notes into a different service and uninstalled. Each year there are more and more limitations on what you can do with a free account. Not worth the time and effort unless you get the premium upgrade, which is getting increasingly more expensive. Used to love it and recommended it to many people. Now, if I ever see it again, it'll be too soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote holds your notes hostage behind a paywall until you pay. I never though somebody would fall this low."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overcharging for basic users is disgusting. This is exactly what everyone feared when Evernote got bought out. The greed is insane, you're not saving lives, this for NOTES. Congratulations, you just lost half your users. Edit: thank you for becoming even worse since my last review, you even took away the possibility of being able to have notes on at LEAST two devices. Now it's only one? Absolutely horrendous parasitic tactics to force people to pay. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After redesign it's imposible to work with the app. Loads my notes for ages, opening up of a note also takes time. I am think of moving away from this app due to the fact that over the time it gets worse... I am frustrated considering the fast that I've been using it for quite a while. With every update feels like it gets even more issues. Main screen with my notes loads ages, clicking on a note to update takes ages, navigating the note can result in a random text selection..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it.... easy organizer to use for all my lists!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"photo drag and drop not working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Removed from all my devices due to multiple hack attempts. The app did not feel secure enough to store personal and business data. It's a shame because I really liked the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Saw an Instagram ad that this was free, it was quite misleading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best free note taking app. Over time, they've slowly made features that used to be free ""premium"" features, meaning you have to pay extra to use the app functions you've been using for many years. It started with limiting the amount of notes that you could have. Now, they only let you have one device free, whereas you used to be able to sync between two devices. I will be transferring all my notes to a different service. Another good app destroyed by the subscription model."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is Very Useful as well as Great App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for many years and then stopped. Came back today to check some of my old notes and found out that the app doesn't let me do that unless I pay. What a shady practice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extorxtion app. Check comments of the other frustrated people to understand why."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Still has bugs on mobile... After 2 years of switching to a paid model of business. They still have not fixed the mobile typing bug. That If you text to fast the app. Cannot keep up and your words go into the ""ether"". Only work around is to backspace... which give you an extra character or close the app and try again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Constant crashes, lost notes, slow search."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"SUPER APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dismal, continues to ask for subscription. Can not open app to use. Had it for years and now unusable. Have gone with Notion, so much better. You can keep it Bendiny Spoons...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great new features in teams"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"False promo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's paid not free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed. Nothing else this app is about anymore. All greed. Death of an app. RIP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Two stars because I used it for eons without any problems but recent changes, constant pop ups and very slow ui forced me to switch to other app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since June 2015, I've been using this application for taking notes and everything. But now due to a lot of changes, I'm finally letting you go. You're not the same app that I used and loved. Goodbye for real, I guess."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a workable but slightly annoying app (considering all I used it for was storing text I always thought it was very slow) but it's unusable now. Every time I open it I have to navigate multiple pop-ups pushing ludicrous subscription plans on me. You ruined it lads, well done. Editing this to say, in September 2024, that the experience of using this app is somewhat worse now. Total contempt for the user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very baddddd!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become egregious and shameless with greedy monetization and limitations that have been imposed by only allowing one device to be connected unless you pay. Now they're even trying extortion tactics by forcing you into having to lift the paywall for the number of notes that can be stored? Pathetic. The performance has also taken a nose dive with delayed login times. This used to be a decent app but avoid it at all costs. There are better free options available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The widget for note list on android devices shows no content. As an evernote user for 10 years, I've always organized my notes according to how the notlist widget could dispay content easily visible and accessible on screen. Please fix this bug for it is my main reason for staying with evernote even after the new note limitations and significant price increases"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let you access notes without trying to force you to pay for a subscription. I like the PC version, but want to be able to access my notes from both my laptop and my phone, which you can do for free with the vast majority of cross platform note taking apps. I didn't realise the free version was limited to one device until today with the forced pop up that you can't close. If it was about £1 per month I'd probably consider it, but for the same price as prime it's not worth it. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access anything anymore, because it's trying to force a subscription on me. And there is no way of getting back to my old notes... Thanks a bunch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing. Now it's ridiculously limited for the free version and there are so many subscription pop ups every time I open it that I'm uninstalling. So many great free apps out there - I don't see the benefit in keeping this with the high price point"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid this depressing hellscape and get Notion. Fundamentally broken. Currently critically bugged where text will occasionally wipe as you close a note. How can you ship software that doesn't do its most core function? Lists have been hopelessly broken for months. In a notes app. So desperately disappointed. It used the be so great. Now bloated with pointless features and so so SO buggy. Which kills its only reason to exist: friction-free notes. Shame on you Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is this? Naha jadi teu bisa dibuka?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Using it on a brand new Pixel 9 and it is not running fast and smooth but instead lagging. I have the paid membership. A little bit disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once you have to subscribe they don't even let you access your old notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app was all great until it started to auto generate To-Do List everyday. My are notes are now buried under a heap of To-Do list. I've tried but couldn't stop this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wasted 10 mins with their set up questions only to find out it was all a part of paid plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10.21 Update: Nemme noch 3 Punkte ab. Die App wird immer schlimmer. Da sind echte Pfeifen am pfuschen. Scrollen in der App sehr träge. Beim Tippen treffen die Buchstaben 2 Sekunden später auf'm Bildschirm ein. 09.24 Update: Diese Woche geht das normale schreiben in einer Notiz nicht, ein Buchstabe geht noch danach ist schluss. Letzte Woche, war login nicht möglich hat unendlich geladen. Nach 9 Jahre suche ich eine Alternative, das geht mir echt aufs Säckele. Tschüsss...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Edited from 5 stars to 4 stars. The overlay for the paid version is becoming more and more obnoxious. Nevermind the price of premium for a notepad app... $60 a year and that's a ""special"" half off price? Come on.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Came back just to view my old stuff. Difficult to use, and just keep slapping premium in my face. I'm glad I didn't have anything important on here. Cringe old wattpad account was more fun to look back at 😆"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the update is so terrible. I can't get into my app. telling me to unsynchronize devices that were never even owned by me. absolutely terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I accepted and installed Evernote for free. After using it for years, they now are holding all my notes and information I entered hostage and will not release the information to me or allow me to transfer it out unless I pay them. Even tho they announced they would start charging they assured they started that there would still be a free, limited version. But now, suddenly I cannot get in to see my notes or transfer them elsewhere unless I pay them ransom. Don't trust them with your notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They must be really struggling. They've become so desperate. A plethora of free alternatives, you're hilarious if you think I'm going to pay $15/month for your little note-taking app. I pay that much for ChatGPT Premium. I could probably recreate this app using ChatGPT if I wanted to lmao. Bye bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very very slow to load on computer and phone. Often I want to jot something quickly so have started using a more simple note app. I have the subscription model currently but will probably change out before next payment as soo slow.... used to be very good..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It says limit reached , where insta advertisement claims it to be free for note taking and 10 primium features, moreover I don't remember storing anything. Is it glitch or what?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Same stubid and expensive app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your time. May be good but £££"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid app hehe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a shame, I've been using this app for years but will now be uninstalling because of how aggressive it is shoving ads in my face constantly trying to get me to upgrade to a monthly or yearly plan. Sorry, but the paid version is not worth the price when there are other free note-taking apps out there that do just as good of a job. I'm switching to Google Keep Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They are fraud and making fool to provide free services on Advertisements and yet ask for premium services payment. I am really so disappointed from their Advertisements"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad, not able to access my info, keep loading, sophisticated. And I am not even able to take out my data and close my account+ Very disappointed! You will feel like locked out from your info after smoothly using the app for couple of years!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frequent pop to upgrade to subscription model. No option for free usage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10.107.0 crash on opening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think Google should kick out this app from Play Store since it is a disgrace to mankind, disgrace to the living, and disgrace to all the ancestor who's hard work made what mankind is today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Oh my god. Finally got into my old account and immediately got 5 f-ing full screen ads to buy a subscription. Tried to app to use features that are no longer premium, but All I see is GET PREMIUM constantly. And only being able to use one phone and not sync to the web? What joke is this? There's far better free or cheaper apps. I wait for the day Evernote falls under completely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There are too many ads to get a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was awesome years ago. Now it's filled with ads to upgrade. What a disgrace."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried to delete account permanently, but got no response."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really gone down hill"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"images in notes are disappearing, and this problem hasn't been resolved since 2021, that's crazy *premium user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be super perfect app but now it is horribly slow and offering you subscription on every step. Once you reach certain amount of notes you are not able to create more. Uninstalled after about 10 years. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad company, bad monetization. Avoid this like a covid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app if not the best. Now its the worst, for free user. Now can only sync 1 device (previously 2), it defeats the purpose of having a cloud storing note, for free user. Secondly, the pop up of asking to subscribe is too aggressive. Literally pop up on every button you press. Rendering the note not user friendly and VERY ANNOYING. My verdict, for free user, look elsewhere. There are better options out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Careful, if you want to see your notes, they'll charge to you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much expensive for note taking app and free account only gets up to 50 notes ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"one of the best app I've ever used over the years and has never seems to amaze me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"***Edited 9/19/24: this app sucks. SUPER BUGGY and doesnt allow writing notes. Always asks for upgrading.... I've been using Evernote for years for creating reminders, lists and to-do checklists. But recently they've added in the stupid ""Do you want to upgrade?"" window/popup that prohibits you from adding a simple note. Even after you say no, and X out of the ad window, it'll keep asking you. Good job Evernote on destroying a really good notes app. Definitely changing apps in the next day or so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash. Forces me here from the online ""free"" site, took my info but the services provided are clearly a scam. They just want ur personal info to sell online, stay away from this garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit Reached. I just downloaded it to check it out, and immediately got limit reached as soon as I opened it! If you think I'm going to pay $77 usd just to be able to see if it's usable, you're out of your mind!!! You're not able to try anything before dropping money for a subscription. You can't see anything to see if the app even has the look/feel that you would use! I'll stick with my pen and paper!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Normally I would give this a 5 star rating. I am a paying personal user since 2017. Suddenly the price is being increased by 18% and I don't see any discount for loyal customers.... grrrrr Not happy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Showing Membership card all time, they are forcing(all time) to buy premium, worst user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money hungry developers ruined the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a worse application I have seen. Switched to Notion, recommended to everyone else. Notion is free and they keep asking for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Bugs, open very slowly. , make it faster and more smooth."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please don't use this ap.. when the limit is reached, it won't let you access your saved notes without purchasing plans!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good App for saving important information permanetly that you can retrieve from anywhere on phone, tablet, computer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful! I have used Evernote casually for over 10 years, often going months without checking my notes. Over the years, the interface has gotten worse, the features have disappeared, and the cost has increased substantially! I haven't opened it in months and did not sign up for a 7 day trial, but today I was met with an undismissable pop-up saying my trial has ended and I will be charged $169.99 annually! There is a note saying to cancel through the play store, but that has been a nightmare too!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been using this app for years, but in the last few years or so, this app became less about writing and more about subscrib8ng to the premium plan Id get at least 5 pop ups for signing up to a premium plan, when all i want to do is just open an old notebook to read. Now i cant even be connected to the app on more than one device, which also upsets me. Anyway.. wont be upgrading to the premium plan for sure"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Didn't open my notes or let me look at notes people sent to me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Inappropriate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a loyal customer of this app since 2012, and I have always been happy to pay the annual fee. However, the recent increase in cost to $130.00 is simply too much for me to justify. I am disappointed that you have chosen to price out your loyal customers, and I will be forced to find an alternative app. Simple put bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like the simplicity of Evernote. Especially the dashboard."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was good once. Now is almost impossible use ""for free"" tools."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing to take premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nothing happens after login page every time I had to login even I can't use it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Some time back, I Installed Evernote app on my android phone. After opening it, limit reached message comes. It tells me to unsync the devices & pay monthly or yearly to access the app. Please fix this ASAP. I uninstall Evernote app from my mobile just now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash app. I used to really like it but now I can't even access my notes without an ad blocking me and not letting me close it out. They want to force me to purchase a subscription. Now I've lost all access to what I had saved. Do not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Quite a lot of functionality and makes sense. Is also reasonably obvious. But extremely ""lazy"". No option to add a new line within the same bullet or a check. When something is broken, have a great patience. And event that might be not enough. Expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Formally good app is now just another greedy company beggi g for money and trying to nickel and dime you to death. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"why is it so difficult to get my Chromebook to work!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"FIX THE APP/WEBPAGE!!! All my work is on the notes. I can't access any of it. Please fix asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favourite notes app. It is sad! Became worse and worse. Now almost unusable in free version due to 4 pup-ups with every single start of the app to sign up for a yearly subscription of over 100€. What are they smoking? It looks like that they want it to die! Transitioning to oneonte or Samsung Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even after several updates, Evernote is absolute rubbish. Web clipper unresponsive. Card scanner not working. Extremely slow and laggy. Although I mostly use Google Keep & Notion these days,I hate that I still have to use this app as I have a lot of old notes in here. Hopefully some day I will find an easy way to migrate to something else entirely. STAY AWAY FROM THIS APP!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app only works on suscription.. Also not so much friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eu quero acessar minhas notas e o aplicativo não permite, eu não vou assinar um plano de vocês, eu só quero minhas notas para passar para um outro aplicativo! Esperando uma solução."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gone from one of the most useful apps the helped with so many things to an ad that happens to let you take notes. Filled with bugs and it almost feels like they are begging to subscribe. Please for the sake of your mental health, find an alternative to this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"EXPENSIVE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"All my older devices used to work well, but not anymore ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"La mejor aplicacion para tomar notas, si existiera una version linux, seria mucho mas genial. Edit: de ser una aplicación simple y funcional se convirtio en un servicio que no cumple con su función básica: crear y compartir notas, llevaba usando la aplicación desde hace años y vi como fue perdiendo funcionalidades hasta que hoy por fin necesito pagar para poder usarla, no puedo crear notas y mis notas están confinadas a un solo dispositivo. Supongo que volveré a escribir en la app de correo xD"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So glad they chose to fix all of the app glitches. I've been using Evernote for over 7 years now, and it's never been better!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why did you remove widget :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant ads are forcing me to delete this once enjoyable app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Then suddenly it's £75 a year or they're going to delete half of my notes. Also, the added bonus of useless AI! transferring my notes and then deleting. Absolute shambles. Get a grip."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Douchebags stopped developing the Linux version, jacked up the price, and are pushing features almost nobody wants. Will be ending my subscription next year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great improvement and evolution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a Premium subscriber and I've opened two support tickets ONE MONTH AGO, and had not a single response since then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's continuously gone downhill. I can't afford the monthly plan or the yearly plan and now on the app I cannot access anything that I already have because it keeps saying ""Limit Reached"" and I can't access anything that I already put in. It's frustrating to not be able to access things that are already mine without paying for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is not opening, force to purchase buy yearly plan, what about my data, how can i save my data No reply from App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ever reliable note taking app. There are several note taking apps out there that come and go, so far, Evernote has been consistent in delivering what's expected from a note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless now. I've had it for years but now they've removed basically all functionality unless you pay $130/yr."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Guys, you should run this app instead start begging on street. After installing the app, after every click, you forced me for purchase your plan. Lol. Without experience the product, why should I purchase your product? Lol system"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"my lovely app for organizing notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Developer has gotten rather stingy recently. They cut almost all of the features that used to be available to free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Please add more table options on mobile users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Already left. Just want to say, we don't miss the annoying pop-up ads for premium, lying that this is our ""last chance"" at a discount for the umpteenth time, don't miss only being able to have one device synced, don't miss how long it takes for the app to load, etc., etc. We currently use workflowy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why does my friend only need to pay HKD38 per month, I have to pay HKD77 per month start in Oct?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Be careful with audio. If you make a second audio recording in the same note it deletes the first one. If you forget to stop/save the audio it doesn't save it at all. We're not beta your beta testers!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It is better now than it was before. All notes open, and there are no sync issues. I wish the app worked faster and had fewer glitches, like when editing content inside a table on the phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is unfair to put restriction on data of user to access it just for compelling him to take paid subscription. You can do it only with proper prior notice to user to copy the data , in case of non subscription. At any rate, i would not subscribe to such apps which indulges in unfair business practices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, it was good. Now it has become a money grabbing corporation. Even if you have used since 2016 and had thousands of notes, no more free for you. They have hard capped you to only 50 notes. On top of that, they have become super bloated so they want to charge a ridiculous amount for what they do now. You can find the same type of program for MUCH cheaper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A empresa e o aplicativo estão nem aí para o usuário. Um fiasco!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The pricing is just ridiculous. For 99€ a year you can decide to get a discounted Evernote Personal subscription - thats the price of a full office family package. Doesn't add up. I loved to use Evernote for some infrequent personal stuff that I'd liked to keep there. But the free version makes even this hardly usable since it annoyingly pushes you to purchase a paid subscription multiple times when open the app. So I'm moving on. It's sad to see how Evernote policy developed in recent years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"so much raise"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm only giving one star because I love the app, but the S pen just doesn't work on sketches. It connects and didconnects but just for this app. If i open another drawing app instantly and sketch it's fine. Basically as you're pressing, and sketching it stops registering input, so you're drawing and nothing happens. But as you lift the pen it draws a bit as your gently lifting. Must be API with Samsung's S pen so i don't blame Evernote per say. If it's fixed it will be the app to use for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"held my writing hostage to pay for something that I used for free. shady. I get it... also I hate subscriptions! don't we ALL!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but now their greed has reduced the number of notes & devices for the free plan & app has become very slow. Constant ads to upgrade make it extremely annoying to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a joke. You kicked users in the *** by being so greedy. Used Evernote for years. Goodbye dumb marketing and annoying ads. UpNote is the best replacement if anyone wondering how to stop using this trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally paid. Nothing in free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too much nagging about premium service. ""Sync up to 1 device"" thanks for nothing, evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Just keep getting ""Error saving attachment"" for everything. On two different phones too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the absolute best note taker!!💯"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Worst developers. Worst Service. They always ask for money and a premium. Even if i cancel the pop up, another offer pops up. Like, really? If I had to take premium, I would, but why do you keep popping up? Something pops up every 5 seconds. I had intended to buy premium when I first installed this app, but after this horrible experience, I have decided not to, even though I have money. Stupid developers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gone downhill big time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed with this new update and pay wall, I've been using this app for well over 10 yrs. The pay wall is unbelievably frustrating and unreasonable... Can only use on one device, soo many pops. Just a Poor user experience, I'm looking for alternatives and will be migrating my notes across."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Wasting my time by fake offers. They said they are providing premium services for free but they lured me into downloading their app and did not provide any premium service for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst App in the history of Android , wastage of time you will be locked for ever with this app if you get involved once ... SERIOUSLY STAY AWAY ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They now hijack your data. Been using for about 15 years now and suddenly I can't get to my files. I have to pay to get to my files! I can't believe this. Isn't this illegal?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One device sync is waste, not worth any features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since around 2018 and it's incredible how bad it's gotten the past couple of years. It's borderline unusable, even aside from all the intrusive pop-up ads trying to get you to subscribe to their service. Everything is slow and buggy, a farcry from what it used to be. I'm going to find another notes app and ditch this one app ASAP because every single time I open it, it's frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most disgusting app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now that they charge $15 a month, for the use of their app. I tried to purchase the month subscription and it fails to work and now I'm locked out of my information. The 1 star is so I can post this. Other wise out would be no stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"takes too long to open the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever. They decided that they wanted to make everyone pay, and now you can even open it to retrieve or remove anything that you saved. If you wanted money, it should've been a period for people who did want to pay or couldn't pay to remove their stuff. No one was given this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Downhill spiral. I want to export my notes elsewhere, bc popups to purchase have become so obstructive that the app is unusable until force close. I can't X out, I don't want to start a free trial and risk losing notes, as I have been using it for free for years and sub price is ridiculous. They started limiting notes more harshly, and I don't even want more notes, I just want to use the ones I have had for years. The newer landing page was awful already, they're pushing users away with greed $"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get out while I could still access my notes and export then to a different app before they get held for ransom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"La peor app de todas, fastidian tanto para que la compres... Yo les sugiero que empiecen a usar Google keep... Demasiado buena y no te cobra como estos farsantes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am not able to use application even after payment.. Very disappointed and so disgusted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The refresh when switching apps makes it impossible to login on a phone. I need to switch apps to get my 2FA code, and when I come back I have to start login over, which means I need to switch to LastPass to get the password then I have to start over again.... impossible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Spam those ads more please! We so need it 😀"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever don't try it. I have used the free version for a long time. But they changed last week, and I don't have access to my notes. This random app. You have to pay for access to your content. They don't send me anything that will be happening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great till the app kept pushing us to sign up for a paid acct in every single step we wanted to use to search for our old notes. Took me 4hrs to shift all my old notes to Google. Been using this APP for more than 10 yrs ago! Now I have shifted all my notes to Google. Bye! Took me 3 hrs to copy all my notes out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for a decade and it was great at first but it has been steadily getting worse. Now you make something that was already available for free (unlimited notes, syncs, notebooks) and lock it behind a paywall, locking out years' worth of notes? Very scummy and what a way to treat your long term users, plus the price increase. Clearly they prioritise profits with no thought at all towards consumers, and they don't deserve my money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app! Limiting to one device is ridiculous and unnecessary. I'll simply just move my content to Keep Notes least that you don't need to pay for and it'll sync on any and however many devices you want."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid is on this app nowadays! Whats the point of using when there are free apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"over the last year or so the software/service has improved no end! is my fav. thing right now!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's becoming a bloatware right now with a constant pop up message and much longer loading time. it's sad considering back then evernote is somehow the best app for note taking"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"7 day free trial and you billed immediately with no refund your a fraud"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the worst app I've ever seen. It's only job is to be a notepad but it can't even do that if you don't pay anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had been using Evernote for many years at absolutely no charge. I have multiple notes saved. Some of which I referred to often. First they limited the amount of notes you can save. I couldn't create any new notes, but could still access my old ones. Now the company is money-hungry and locked me out from accessing ANY of my notes unless I pay an absurd fee. Very disappointed in this company. Do yourself a favor and NEVER use this app. Use one of the many free apps for creating and saving notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many feature, much slower and less intuitive. UI is constantly changing. long time of customer looking for a good open source option to switch to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop bombarding me with paywalls!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"app has become slower and more bloated over the years. I miss when it was simple and easy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"you can only have one text note with the free version. this has made me use another notes app with unlimited notes for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had to change my review after the app locked all my notes and was forcing me to pay to unlock it. It felt like it was holding my information ransom until I paid. I was so disappointed and put off that It felt like the S word.... ""SCAM"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It says free map is over and you should pay money to reach previous notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used to love Evernote and paid for it for years, but since I don’t need it on multiple devices now, I switched to the free version. Unfortunately, it’s been a frustrating experience. Every time I try to access a note, I get bombarded with pop-ups to upgrade. Clicking X doesn’t stop them for long, and it’s super distracting when I’m in a rush. I was going to subscribe again, but now I’m just put off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly its not free and I cannot access my notes unless I pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this notes app to organize my recipes. But they have been removing and paywalling feature after feature. You will not get money from me, just accept it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"every update in 2024 has been a disaster. 98 percent of my notes are unavailable from two of my tablets, and new notes can not be made."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing. I'm unable to access my notes for a month now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointly monitized into obcelence"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Falling behind. This used to be where I kept everything I knew. Other apps have bypassed it. I find myself using other apps, e.g. Keep Notes and Notewise, to keep things. It's causing my knowledge to be in different places and I have a hard time remembering where things are"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Professional Subscription. Much more than a 'notes app', Evernote is my Personal Assistant! It's my digital brain since 2010. Since Bending Spoons bought Evernote in Nov 2022, the capability, stability & functionality of Evernote have sky-rocketed. Sure, it was frustrating while it was in flux & development, but now it's great. I use this app on multiple devices to support & organise my personal life & working life. It's amazing!!! More than notes; Calendar, Voice-to-text transcribe, tasks, AI."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forced to pay without knowing how the app is for myself is unfair and unprofessional..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eigentlich OK aber man wird so zugemüllt mit Werbung für sich selber. Dazu kommt Buchungsbetrug. Kostenlos somit für mich unbenutzbar. Ich Wechsel."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too expensive, terrible support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good notes app but now is completely unusable on my phone. Not sure if its down to the recent upgrades but it no longer opens on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I give one extra star because the app is the best of its kind that I've used. Been using it for over ten years but I can't take the constant tricks to coerce me to pay. I only use the app to make simple notes, and the premium plan is way too expensive for that. They constantly nag me to upgrade and now they've limited use to one device. I have to use one of 10 monthly unsyncs to be able to use the app on my computer and phone, which I've been doing for a decade plus. I won't be upgrading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest upgrade prevents me from viewing my existing notes. Insists I subscribe and there is no way to close the pop up and view my note without signing up. Used to be my favourite note-taking app for years but now the pop-ups to upgrade are so frequent it is difficult to use the app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app! But updates annoying. Why not make them less intrusive?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A former user , but the free version is so limited that does not allow to test any features ( even those available on similar apps for free ). The ads are too many and hard to close"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worse with every upgrade. The app rotates, despite my having all phone rotating turned off. Pop ups EVERY open, no mate, I don't want to pay. Now it's minimum 3 clicks to actually get into my notes?! Why are they not there on opening like they use to be, what else do you think I'm doing here?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crooks. Now you can just have one one ONE device connected. So no sync at all since nothing to sync with. So moved to Google keep and other apps. Paid version is much too expensive for use once in a while. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i have been using this for years,now suddenly they force me to pay for it. otherwise i cannot even read my notes. they dont even allow me to remove devices ive lost.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app until I had to close like six pop ups offering subscription and stuff everytime I wanted to write a note. I'm moving to a different notes app and moving everything because this app sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had my account for years. First, The app got worse/complicated, then there were limits, then they locked me outnof my own writings. I am paying to get my notes back and ditching this app. I just wanted a decent notepad, morons."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This recent push for subscribers is unreal, now limiting synced devices to only 1 for previously free users? I hope your greed undoes you someday"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a crime that after years with a free account, hundreds of notes created, the service is now useless unless paying for a premium account. And if you don't, you are constantly bombarded with promo ads. Thank you very much Bending Spoons for having ruined our user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$15 month 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Doesn't work yet. I have 16 notes on web, can see only 14 on mobile. BendingSpoons needs to put a bit more work on this app. Will check back in a couple of years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Had potential but I guess only subscription buyers can experience it. The UI is very wacky, auto pop ups for subscriptions, and can't even access the AI tool as it's subscription only, they couldn't even think of giving a one time payment option for the app as a choice for those who are willing to spend money on it but not on Monthly or yearly basis."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using this app for more than 3 years but app free access not able to see my notes asking for monthly/yearly payments worst app don't use anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"buggy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WAS a great app- before the premium subscription and pop up garbage. Can't even get to the part where I type up a note without having to close the ""pay for our premium!"" Bs 3-6 times. Absolutely maddening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Only support one device for free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love y'all.....thank you for your work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst notes app. Don't waste your money. Trust me on this one. Can't add images to notes. If you attach them as an attachment they get rotated for no reason. Some of my notes won't even load. The ones that do are very slow to load. Time to move on to something else. Update: June 6th, 2023. Updated like you suggested, nothing fixed, even more problems now. You are the worst at this. Please find other jobs, seriously!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access my notes as soon as I open the app it's full of paying adds for the program that have no exit or close button it's so frustrating I can't see any of my notes especially when I'm in a hurry. Please solve this problem it's very bothersome I might delete the app all together."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems like every time you open the App there's a page of all the listed updates. Hugely frustrating when you just want to see your stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pushing pro too much. Swapped to Mind Notes. I have used this for years and years but now all it does is spam you with going pro, over and over. It's gotten laggy too and I think that's all of their bloating the app. I only need it for a few work notes here and there, I don't need premium. It's a real shame because it was a good app when it was new."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a few year and finally decided to delete it after the many pop-ups made me ""pocket-buy"" the app while walking. There's so many pop-up it makes the app almost un-usable. The price is also completely out of touch. I will NEVER pay that much to take notes when there's so many free options out there. This app has been nothing but frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful. Been a free user for 2 years and now app has lost everything and tries to sell me an upgrade. Furious and would encourage anyone to read the reviews as this app has destroyed my personal information. Disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Relentless subscription notices. Most of the time can't access notes due to repeated ads for subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"i dident like that i put notes down and if i dident save them they got erased"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Upon opening the app now one is forced to pay. There is obviously a workaround to that. But they are still trying and now using the attempt to fool users that they are required to pay. How desperate they are is a hint that there are many good alternatives to Evernote available on the Playstore 😉 One star for the troll"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was rated 5 stars... This is a case study in how to ruin a good app. Remove the paywall to at least allow loyal, long-time users to access previous notes and keep good will. Francesco Patarnello appears nearsighted and strategically inept, should reconsider his role as CEO for killing this product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Years ago I had this app recommended to me, and I loved it. It helped me stay organized and was overall just a nice layout. However, over the past several years the amount of stuff I could do on this app kept on decreasing. There are endless popups, the app runs horribly, and now I can't even use it on 2 devices without being assaulted by paywalls. The fact I cant even use this on my laptop anymore without paying an exorbitant amount is just insane. Im deleting & moving my notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used the app many years ago and tried reinstalling it, in 5 minutes I didn't manage to create a new note and got asked to update to the premium plan around 20 times... Guess I will keep not using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sep 2024 - Unable to login ppst update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting worst on every updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to create account im getting json response"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You ruined it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is great... but y'all gotta stop with the popup every 30 seconds asking me to pay for the premium subscription. I'm so close to deleting the app because I'm tired of hitting the same super tiny ""not interested"" button every time I go from one section of the app to another. Ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app I have ever used. I have became more productive because of this app even though I can only make one notebook it is enough for me to fit my to do list and other important notes there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful! You can't do anything without paying. Restricts you in every way possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even log in properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't trust this app, after few weeks will freeze to force you pay money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Revising my rating from 5 to 1 star. This was a good app and I used it for a long time, but their ever increasing push for paid usage makes it unusable. By all means, enforce payment to make your product profitable, but don't make the free version a nightmare to use with constant advertising (rather don't offer a free version at all). Add to that, it's close to impossible to get your data off this app if you do decide to leave one day. There are better free apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very expensive 😔. Who will pay this much monthly subscription for just a note application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I still love my -old- notes but I can't even normally see one. On every single click it's a very agressive ""are you sure you won't upgrade"" , usually ends with an app crush. And I just wanted to see one note. Last sync limit is one device. Guys, you can't call it a sync anymore. I wish I can have a normal option to switch to other app but with evernote it seems only manual rewriting. Sadly, my fav note app became a buggy mess with features I don't need. And good features aren't handy anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for over 10 years and used to be such a good app. Then Enshittification. Now the UI makes it borderline unusable making me force close it multiple times before I can actually do anything. Uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Give you a free account and then block it and hold you to ransom for money to retrieve your notes. Avoid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing. Now everytime you open it up you are bombarded with paywalls. I even had to un-sync my tablet because it wont let me be synced to 2 devices unless I pay. Every app wants you to pay now and it's ridiculous. I have been using this app for years and now all of the sudden they want my money? For what? Well now I'm deleting it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated: Now for Free user two device usage is now removed only one device per account.. Then in future you pay I will show your important notes. Instead of selling your product it more towards forcing.. Bad Marketing strategy Day by day the updates are irritating!! The much liked feature about this app is its simplicity to just open quickly start creating your notes now it pops up, loads and keep one asking me to upgrade are you sure. Now I am sure to move to another apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's fake"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I love Evernote, but it's support system is very lacking. I would appreciate having a phone number that I can call when I have a problem, not a chat that is not supported by a live person. Recently, I was not able to get into my program, all that came up was 4 icons that took you nowhere. I could not get any live assistance. It was very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for years and loved it, but in the last two months lost important medical data I had on my phone because apparently there is now no way to undelete, and I had both a list and table disappear because the delete function assumed I wanted everything deleted rather than just one line or word. I had learned to make changes on my computer rather than the phone, but can now only have it on one device. Once I download my other notes this app will, regretfully, be on none of my apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For a subscription based application, I understand that most features are reserved for paid users. But for being a note application, limiting access of 50 notes is something that I would rather get to a different app than keeps on being bothered by the pop-up warning of the limit that I have reached. I keep reinstalling and uninstalling this app hoping they did something better about it but to no avail."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You must subscribe to see this comment. Limited time 40% discount"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. I saved all of my recipes and quick notes here. But in recent years it has gone downhill as they push for payment, and everything useful is now behind a paywall, but it's not worth the price. I can hardly even use the app at all now due to the number of times I'm blasted with a payment request that I cannot X out of, when I'm just to view my saved recipes! Now you can only ""sync"" one device. It's ridiculous and useless now for me personally."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesnt allow to use the app. It just get stuck at unsync all the device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Less options, now can only have one device. Previously could have mobile and web. Now only can have one or the other. App has led functionally than the web."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have a Samsung galaxy A52s(SM-A522B/DS) with Android 11 but the app crashes and closes.I can not use it.in previous version it was ok."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible service, no longer worth using. I was a very happy user of this app since 2015. In the last year, the developer has changed everyone's favorite hassle-free freemium notes app into a paywall hellscape that costs more to use than a premium streaming service, all for an online app you type notes into. The free app has incessant glitchy pop-ups, and they've changed around all the good things about the app as well. 0 stars if I could, for taking my lifetime of notes hostage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I think this app is decaying. First time I started using this app, there were no limitations on creating notes, nor there was any limitation on device you can log on to. First they limited devices to 3, then limited the amount of notes you can create. Now you have to pay money to connect to even a second device & create new notes. I'm expecting them to ask for subscription even for using search bar. Briefly, you can look for another app for taking notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lagging on mid range phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App is very glitchy - I receive notifications all the time that it has been updated but notice no improvements. Some of the problems: using Gboard, text often disappears while writing, cannot select multiple notes, it's very slow to open and jot a quick note, offline sync for text notes (only a few megabytes...) takes hours."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app keeps getting worse 🤯"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been my go to note app for the past 12 years. I persevered through the irritating bloat and constant push to upgrade but with the recent limit to only one synced device the free version is now unfit for purpose. I have made the transition to Google Keep and won't be returning."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since new app was rolled out, my keyboard stops working almost every time I begin typing in a note. I have to close the note or the app and open it again. I have a Galaxy S23 Ultra. It's so frustrating. Makes me want to switch to Onenote. You gotta fix this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years as it's become progressively worse - endless ads to click through ar start up, works on fewer devices, fewer notes allowed, until finally they decided to brick themselves entirely. It was $35 per year and now well over $100?? For a note taking app that does nothing special?? I switched to Up Note. Same functions for $35 LIFETIME subscription. Or free. It just works, like Evernote used to years ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's just a note app. Why does it need subscription? They took away free features that have always been there little by little."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Much needed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you want the ""free"" version, expect to be constantly bombarded with offers to upgrade to the paid version. The only reason I still use the app is because all of my notes are basically ""held at ransom"". I can't export them without upgrading to the paid version of the app. If I choose to use a different note taking app, the only ""free"" option to export my notes is to screenshot each page of my notes and re-enter the notes manually."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just the most recent fiasco- I must clear 5.8GB of offline storage while I reinstall the app due to yet more sync issues. How is it possible to get sync wrong so consistently, for so many years? And now if I want ""notebooks"" in the quick access bar, I most forgo having ""shortcuts"" available. This once great app (as in a decade ago) continues to decline in usability under BS while they add (and aggressively push) pointless features like calendar and tasks I will never use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"became ugly and slow, not any more what it was in the past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Refused to open my notes!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aug24 Another update & app still Unusable!!! 😡🤬 I am a paying member. Update Sept24, I'm going to start trying out competitor apps, Notesnook, Keep, Obsidian. The cost is a joke now, app is getting bloated with things I dont need & no basic plan any more. Will NOT be renewing my subscription, the price is atrocious! And Because atm evernote is getting to be utter 🐎 💩 !! What a complete disappointment after so many good happy years 😪"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"search doesn't work, many other issues, fed up with this app and service. Will look for alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know who bought this company or who made the recent decision to make all of the changes the app has undergone, but all of these people should be relieved of their duties. It is no longer a joyful tool for productivity. It is a chore to use. I'm looking into other tools before completely walking away. I've made thousands of notes for dozens of novels with evernote and I organized materials for my doctorate dissertation here. I used to love this app. It's garbage now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent Very helpful app. 9/9/24: Received a note that the price is going from $45 to $130 annually. It is a great program, but not worth a 64% increase in cost. Found NoteJoy at $45 per year for 1 person, and was a simple import of my thousands of notes. Sorry Evernote, I've been with you from the beginning, but I must say buhbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"THE CAKE IS A LIE! The short version (and all that will fit here) is that the paid version has excellent functionality and organizational tools, and syncs seamlessly across all platforms. However, all subscription tiers are for one user (no affordable, multi-user family plan), and there is no useful data portability. If you export your notes, all organization within a notebook is lost; so good luck trying to switch to a different app if you want to at some point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Sad reading poor comments on an app I once lived. I've been using Evernote for at least 13 years and see I gave a 5 Star review almost 10 years ago to the day. I can't do that anymore. I don't ask a lot of the program but store a lot of info in my notes, info I need to retrieve regularly. The UI and functionality, especially the search feature within notes, has become garbage since the last major update. 3 stars might be generous. Time to look elsewhere?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I really liked this app. I used it for business and personal. I am going to look for another app. The feature I really liked was access to notes on more than one device (2 seems reasonable). I thought I had gone crazy until I read other reviews and realized everyone is frustrated with the changes as well. It states you can transcribe written notes to text, but that must be a paid benefit that I don't have, and I can't even try it to see if I would want to pay for it. No, thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Should be called ""Nevernote,"" because these mfers had the app free for years, and now they're holding all my important notes like SSN, addresses, etc. hostage by throwing up a thing demanding $15/mo that I can't get rid of, to use MY NOTES STORED ON MY PHONE. This app used to be great. Now it's GARBAGE. I just want a digital notepad. If it were a one time $5 purchase, I'd have bought it without hesitation; it's worth $5. It is NOT worth an ongoing subscription of any kind."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgusting. The app has turned into ransomware. At first it constantly demanded to buy an extended plan. Now it simply blocks access to notes made in the free version unless you pay. Everybody needs money, but it is not the way! I would never recommend it to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote the bullying strategy that you started on us is absolutely disgusting. I can't wait for this app to completely disappear from the space. 10 years of infos on different projects that I no longer access. Congratulations 👏🏿"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Absolutely filled with ads and promotions that are almost impossible to close. The app is almost unusable because of that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't install this app now as it's Forcing people to upgrade and lock their notes is totally baseless and against their right to privacy Guys please stop using this app and move your data from this app to Google Notes or other available apps. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I instilled on a new phone and now all about money, it's a good app, maybe I'll rethink it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had been a paying customer since 2013. I lost the ability to add new notes and the price doubles. One note is better than Evernote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If at all I give unsubscribe, it's not taking. I'm so pissed ryt now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moved on to a different app once they started forcing people to buy a subscription just for the bare minimum of feature. I had so many notes on this app but I've just given up on it once they limited people to only 50 notes. Who even only needs 50 notes?? Especially if you use it for note taking or writing related projects. Unless you have the money this is not worth it at all. Which is a damn shame because I loved this app for years and swore by it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is dead. They have squeezed the last drops of profits from their loyal customer-base."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good app, but constantly asking for money and to sign up. This was the industry standard so someone bought it and turned it into 💩. If you are grandfathered in it's just annoying but for new users it's unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app doesn't even open. I've tried installing and uninstalling. Nothing works. Just loads endlessly when you first open the app. Edit: I FINALLY got this to work again...only to get this pop up demanding I subscribe. I cannot see any of my notes/docs now. Selecting any of my notes just shows subscription plans!! There is no way to close it either you are FORCED to pay in order to continue! WORST APP POSSIBLE! All my documents and notes lost!!! Now because of this. I refuse to pay!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app but now they keep limiting what you can do to try and get you to pay. Could sync 3 devices, now it's one. Says you can have 50 notes but is actually 25. Maybe less now. The user interface continues to get worse with each update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Barely usable. Asks me for money every time I open it, before you could use it on multiple devices, and now, just one, and has had syncing issues when it was on two devices. Otherwise there's nothing here that onenote can't do... which I will be switching to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now Useless app in free mode after 13 years usage. I think it s the end of evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"makes my life so much more organized! LOVE IT!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App broken, content export broken, business model broken. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The people who now own this app are just cowboys, you either pay them almost £80 per year or you can forget about using the app on more than one device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"over the past year the rate of improvements and new features has been staggering. I loved Evernote and now I love it even more!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The best notepad app available, I've used this since I first got my old Evo. Nexus S 4G, ICS 4.0.3 rom EDIT 9/8/24: good job destroying this app with bloat and ridiculous subscription prices. I've switched over to OneNote, which most people already have with Office 365."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before restricting user access to their notes, consider providing an option to delete or transfer their data from the (free) app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this program is fantastic i use it for all my needs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even more useless, can only swap between devices 10x a month?! Even leaving the app in migraine -inducing Hey Evernote: stop trying to push paid versions every time I open the app. You lost me months ago and the only reason I'm still using it at all is that it's hell to export old notes. Evernote priced me out of using it. it tried to be everything under the sun and lost the core of the note-taking app. too many bad features. Moving to notion"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app years ago but they introduced a 2 device limit so I stopped using then. Just tried again and it's still no good. I'll stick to Google Keep thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be good and gave you flexibility. At some point, they got incredibly money hungry and now they won't let you use Evernote on different platforms unless you pay. Needless to say, I'm taking my notes elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do people actually pay $180 a year to take notes on their phone?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"laggy outdated app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It constantly try to sell me upgrades"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the new owners, Bending Spoons acquired the app it has continued to get functional worse. Today I was writing a few notes on my next script and while typing my screen flipped to landscape and I have the phone locked on portrait mode. This continued auto rotating as I was leaning back in my chair. This caused me to stop being creative and try to find an issue. Very annoying and was not able to resolve the problem thus I'm here trying to decide whether to move everything to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. But over the years they started to charge more for the same service. I was okay with that. Great apps deserve to earn money. But then they started to change core aspects of how the app worked. I had to switch to something else before Evernote got worse. Probably one of the worst experiences I've had with a company since Blizzard/Activision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"why do you struggle to allow correct writing in languages ​​that are written from right to left. Dropbox Paper makes it easy from a lot of years. This is simple to add and a lot of users asked if from many years. What is the secret?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many bugs and so few advantages over the last version to actually work, v8! Instead of 5 steps, it now takes 15 steps to save a web link into my chosen notebook and add a bit of text to it. This version has obviously been created in a lab by engineers, without any actual user input! Text drag & drop doesn't work; where's the New Note peristant notification gone? Tech support NEVER replies. I'm the idiot for paying $160 a year! Check out Joplin, Zoho, Obsidian, Notion & even OneNote instead!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't handle continuous advertisement of paid plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over ten years ago, I gave a five-star review for this app, having tried a number of options and being very pleased with Evernote. Since then, the monetization of the app has driven every developer decision, resulting in the loss of most useful functions for free users. If you like yearly subscriptions, then you might like this app. If not, they've removed the ability to sync across even two devices, which is the last straw for me. Time to find a different option. Down to one star for me, sadly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app was initially good when it first came out. But now notes from a while ago are lost. It apparently costs money to have on more than once device. Compared to other note taking apps, it's subpar. Uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great way to access info from any device. User friendly. After using evernote for 10 years, they have locked me out, holding notes hostage. With no prior warning or info. Bad practices, very distressed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They are begging now to take their plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't even open any more. What happened to this app? It used to be amazing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others, I was dismayed when the full screen ad tried to force me in to paying just to access my notes. I found that quitting and relaunching, I had a few seconds before the ad popped up - allowing me to get into the settings. Once in there I was able to de-sync all but one device so I could get access to my notes. Now time to back them up and close my account..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot go back from the payment page without subscribing. Go to hell"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Totally portable with seemless synch between devices. The desktop app is easier to use, bur the mobile and tablet version work well. Must be good, as I've bought the upgrade, and I never pay for this sort of thing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for 7 years. It was really good until this subscription appeared out of nowhere, limited notes, and unable to access in multiple devices. Switched to Notion. Getting better service than ever before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"cela fait des années que j'utilise Evernote, pour mes cours, comme pense bête....et c'est à présent terminé. TOUT devient payant. pouvoir se connecter sur un seul appareil? sinon il faut payer? ne plus pouvoir créer trop de notes sinon il faut payer? on ne peut même plus ranger nos notes sinon IL FAUT AUSSI PAYER. bref, avant je conseillais Evernote, aujourd'hui FUYEZ sauf si vous voulez payer pour écrire des notes lol."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not allow me to open my notes. I used this app for years, and now they want $15/ month!!!! Not happening!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best most useful app I have. One of few I pay for, because it is worth paying for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you stopped access without warning and forced me to pay to access my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It just seems to work 🙃"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am quitting Evernote after waiting for more than a year in the hope that it will become a little better to use like before. Its becoming worst in every update and while using in PC .. it uses 99% or cpu everytime. I dont know what ""Bending spoons"" need from our pc. Bending spoons is not trustworthy. I am waiting to see its downgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All I want is an app to make notes in. This used to be great. Now, I am limited to 50 notes unless I subscribe. Forget that. Plus, I get bombarded by their sales specials every time I open it. And now, I deleted old notes, down to 20, and still can't create new notes, even with 1 notebook. Tume to find something new."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"very useful for all... but the thing is the policy of the company... it's like choking the throat of students & other small users. Unable to access from 2 devices, which was the most essential thing whether you are on travel or somewhere. At least provide the basics. Company could limit the notes you can make also some additional ft for premium. Bt plz do not do this at this cost. Poor user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Typing freezes, and despite keystrokes, nothing shows up as text. Very frustrating! Defeats the whole purpose of being able to make notes. Prior to about July, it worked well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to have it, don't even worry about downloading it, used to be great now is straight trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the amount of popups on the free account makes it useless. it's an absolutely disgusting practice to say you provide a free version like this. be upfront about the horrible experience you offer for free or don't offer one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"For some reason with the latest updates, the notes just stop typing and I need to go out and back in again before I can continue typing. This is after using Evernote for 7 years. Using on a Samsung S24 Ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good but idk if a new company recently took it over or what... Now it's VERY glitchy and slow, hard to use. Needing constant updates that just make it worse, loss of features or missing features that just seem obvious for a notes app to have (ie can't select multiple notes at once anymore??). Not to mention they said they were doubling the price to something absurd like $16/mo for a BASIC notes app. I'm just sad that I'll have to move all my notes to something else now 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much lagging"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new app updatecis buggy, unreliable can't do simple edit functions like cut paste. Poor show Evernote. Very very disappointed after using and subscribing to Evernote for several years now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great app, too expensive though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this as a free app for a some time. One day, they closed my access to the app without warning. The only way I would be able to access my notes was to start to pay $15/month. Don't ever start to use this as an app unless you're willing to pay monthly for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"clumsy and unreliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best organizational app that I have ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy bastards have hijacked all the notes I have been carefully saving over the last few years. There is suddenly no longer a free version. Important information is no longer available unless you pay their ""ransom"" they have stolen information similar to scammers, can you say ""Class action""? They at least have to give YOUR Information back to you if you can't make new notes, towards the end they also made it more difficult to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most intrusive pushy app never willing to give 2 seconds of peace of mind.. Instead trying to coax into paying for upgrade. If only negative ratings were available, I would have given the lowest rating for an app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote for years. I like that my notes are always readily accessible on the multiple devices I use to create and retrieve notes. Evernote is my journal and travel log. I use it to record inspirational ideas, write contemplative insights, prepare for presentations, etc. Evernote provides ready made templates for use and offers a variety of features that make it fun and creative to use. It's constantly being upgraded with new functionality and improvements. It great! 👍 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"been my source for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Since the beginning"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I can't access this app with free again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updating a 1 star review from 2021. Still 1 star, the price increase is insane. I was a customer for years, and I'm finally leaving. I can't believe how bad this app has gotten. I hope for their sake, the new price hike makes up for the people leaving. Screw Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be the GOAT for note taking and for going paperless. Unfortunately it seems to be getting worse and worse over the last few years. When I open my notes app I don't expect it to take an age and have to update itself. The desktop app is even worse, it is bloated mess that spends a few minutes every time it's opened downloading and installing new updates. After probably 10 years of paying for this I will now be looking for a better alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Can't access wanting without paying. Everything that I had is now inaccessible 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loss my data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst. I've truly grown to loathe this company. I have over 10 years of notes in my account that I can no longer access unless I pay. But the cost is way too high for a glitchy note taking app. I used to recommend this app to everyone. Now I will cheer the day they close their doors for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why has the user experience gone become so horrible? The app keeps crashing the moment you open it.Can't access my notes, notebooks, or basically anything on the app.It keeps saying there is a bug,but there hasn't been an update since 10th March 22. 5thSep24: The subscription fee is too high,and the reviews for the paid app are negative all across the usage. What used to be a useful and easy app has now become unusable. No way anyone should be paying over 50$ for what one can get free elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for limiting the sync devices. I can finally leave this platform alltogether."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sick of the constant pop ups for premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Instagram ad says ""don't buy this app, every feature is free""... and now I learn that if you don't pay $135 DOLLARS you lose your notes?! SCAM."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In my experience of using this, it was so useful, helpful...but today is as dump as a waste"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The slowest app I have ever used, and I am only working with 30 text notes. I thought buying a subscription would help — it didn't. The worst part is that even the web version on the computer runs at a snail's pace. And where did this Machiavellian idea come from to log you out of the web version every time the computer stays in sleep mode for too long?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be the app i would keep all my notes. It was great. Until they force you to pay for a subscription and you are not allowed to use it unless you upgrade. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely brilliant app... Untill they brought 'new blood' in the board, a few years ago. They absolutely and completely destroied it, while doubling the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Destroyed by the developers. Used to be a great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost all my data; the popups are incredibly annoying; the app is slow, and there are much better alternatives. Don't download this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it, but 1st they decide to charge for previously free features, only to make it SO much worse. Can't get recent notes on front page, often have to tap note several times for it to register, takes like 10 secs to open, in-note search is glitchy. Used to be able to switch apps and current note would stay open but now it exits every time, awful if you're going back&forth btw apps taking notes coupled w the multiple clicks needed to access note & load time. On the hunt for new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have maxed the number of notes the app will allow and now I can not get into the app unless I accept a subscription. This is the worst 😔."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aggressive and obnoxious marketing banners that are made difficult to get rid of make it hard to use the app without being tricked into purchasing a yearly subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"CANNOT USE WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTION!! $$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep scamming you for your money and lock you out of your important notes. How do I cancel them?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The annoying popup ads I could deal with, I could even handle having limited notes, but now I can't even LOOK at the notes I've taken in the past without paying. There is a popup that appears in the first few seconds of opening the app and there is no way out of it without signing up for a paid subscription. Years of notes and ideas and vital information are being held HOSTAGE, and I can't even move them to another app. It's VILE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is PAINFULLY SLOW! It has gotten quicker in the last week or so, but it's still a huge pain. It used to be instant in the past. When choosing the camera, I get either a white or black screen (half of the time), when you go back to refresh it to get it to work, it then kicks you out of your note AND your notebook. Fix these issues and I'll stay. Otherwise I'm gone after 15 years. Also, this ai transcription button gets in the way of my pictures. Please allow us to toggle it off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Man... This used to be my bible. As an artist it was a godsend to have a quality notebook on your phone for sketching lyrics, texts, diaries, thoughts. Looked nice, too. And free, I might add. For 5 years I wrote everything in there and then one day someone smelled revenue. Now all my stuff is locked behind a paywall. Me and many many others. What a scam. Oh well, should've known..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be such a great application but has really deteriorated over the last few years. I suspect that there has been some kind of falling out with Microsoft so that it can no longer be used with Microsoft outlook. If you have updated the Windows version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blackmailer.. I've lost all my impprtant notes. My only mistake was I t4usted evernote. They will offer you free notes and after some time they will block all your contents demanding subscription or loose your data. You'll have no choice if you have no backup. Tjat's how they blackmail you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"to do list is best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"each update makes it worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They used to provide more for the free program. Now it's so limited that it's time to start to migrate to another solution. Not paying almost Spotify prices for something Google Keep can do"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Should allow me to retrieve information before blocking it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has blocked access to my stored notes. Apparently they are held ransom as I must pay for a plan. I would never have added notes to this ""free app"" if I would have known this. At first they limited new notes, but you could access existing notes now blocked. Bad business for users. 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I don't like how you throw ads up, I don't like how you change the UI, it's just a notepad for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App use to be great. Use to absolutely love the app and features. Unfortunately greed has now taken over and all I get is popups asking for me to upgrade to the paid version. The app is overrun by the damn popups. Don't download this app if you hate pop ups. I'll be transferring all my notes to an app with less greedy developers who don't bombard me with ads and popups. Well done for destroying a once perfect app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using the app from 2015 it was really good, now it's really bad! Need to uninstall and switch other note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not put your passwords or notes into this app with the free version. After using it for many years it won't allow me to retrieve any of my notes with passwords included. Absolutely ridiculous!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote made everything so much harder to navigate ever since they started charging. I've been 'PAYING$$$' FOR THIS APP and now even my shortcuts disappeared to somewhere so inconvenient and so hard to find. Short Cuts is supposed to be right up front WHERE IT WAS so you can easily get to it. THAT'S WHY IT'S A 'SHORT CUT'!!! GET IT?!!!!!😠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years and have generally loved it. However, in the past few months, I've noticed significant issues that are quite frustrating, especially for a paid service. Sometimes, the application simply won't open at all. Additionally, links embedded in my notes often fail to open the resources they're supposed to. It's incredibly disappointing and unexpected for a product that comes with a subscription fee!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why force me to buy your yearly plan for RM107+?? Isn't this a free app for us to download??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Forced to pay a monthly fee or lose everything, because they said I had reached my limit. I accidentally chose monthly instead of yearly and no way to go back and change it. I've had evernote for a long time with no complaints, until now. I'd rather pay a one time fee for an app. I hate monthly fees."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is soo expensive and it may not affordable for students like meeee...I requested to all to use onenote rather than Evernote which is free for all .and fullfill many of needs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just a cash grab app, I don't expect this company to still be in business for long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"App is good but very slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a useful app. now it's nothing but nonstop ads for the subscription version, multiple full screen pop ups every time, often with no simple way to exit. can't even sync multiple devices without paying, which is the main purpose of the app. completely useless, I'm switching to a different app ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"greedy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I couldn't be more disappointed and angry with a app right now. All my new poems have been written here as well as the start to stories I have. And to be locked out unless I pay 15$. I pay the 15$ and my stuff is not even there. On top of that it keeps kicking me back to the pay again screen. I would like my writings and money back. If I could give less than a star I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a shame what has become of Evernote throughout the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now there's a limit and they want $15 a month to add more notes? Every time I log in it's something else. Unsync a device, delete notes, sign up for a plan. I'm just gonna copy and paste all my notes into Samsung notes. FOH, your app isn't worth paying for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It have ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love it.... I know I was one of the first users ever because I had all the way back when I had a Blackberry. Now I hate it..... It's stupid af & the developers are stupid af for doing too much. I bet they've lost soooooooooooo much business, from their day one, previous loyal customers. Bye until y'all get smart again!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"se me hace una payasada que no me deje enlazar dos dispositivos en la versión gratuita y que no me deje entrar en la versión web desde mi cel, es una pena, tendré que cambiarme a otra opción, ¿Cuál recomiendan?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very bad experience now. Earlier it was good but now not even able to login to my account. Please fix this asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From bad to worse, this app became frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Everytime I clicked, there you are...an ad begging for money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great improvements. Keep it up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ads, can't take notes because too many ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App not recommended anymore In the past I was really happy with Evernote, but not anymore: way too SLOW, android app with annoying bugs and not worth the price. The app offers AI tools and new (useless) layouts but can not provide the basics. Will change to NOTION soon which, the note export seems easy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been with Evernote almost since the beginning... when things were free... I could connect 3 devices, create all the notes I wanted, you could find things easier.... EVERY update has been a stab and has taken the life from this app. It has become all about money... no longer about the customer. Something happened to this company, and it wasn't good. I'm ready to find a different and better app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"was excellent before, now it's utter c**p! went to copy notes to Google Keep, it took a few minutes of pop ups, ads, offers and whatnot until app final let me see my freaking notes. incomprehensible nonsense which most certainly isn't going to make anyone stay with them. avoid! if, for any unrealistic reason you find the app useful still, avoid anyway as there are far better options available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They killed free version. No more sync between devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"plain greed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever with this application on Android. Go to the Google Notes app ! Constantly begging for money for an initially free acces. Shame on you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good note app, but pricings for subscription are too much, to be honest Earlier I could use it on my pc and phone, and now it restricts me from doing it, saying that i have reached the limit of devices. Sadly, I will abandon the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Generally a good notes app. Recent updates have dated useability a little (for example, the text search function no longer takes you to the text)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Left due to constantly being harassed to purchase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years with no issues. But now they want to charge me and will not allow me to access my notes unless I pay. 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't have more than 1 device anymore without getting juiced for money. It has really gone down hill. Time to find a new free note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Returners user and found that ads keep popping up ask for purchase at each function you wanted to used, as I remember it's not always like this, this app getting worse. I'm going to day one apps for my journal writing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you guys have become a greedy money seeking app. will soon uninstall and switch to a new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Randomly disabled the free version. Can't access notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed. App used to be fair with freemium features but slowly all became completly pay walled and there is no One Time Payment option. Subscription Only and it's too pricey. Such a shame because I used to use it so much between my Desktop and Mobile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"not enough storage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"when reading info from bussiness cards app freeze sometime"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rip off"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is blocking me from accessing my account with a mandatory subscription screen that I can not skip!!!! I am not able to export my notes and now I want to delete my account without losing my notes but don't know how?!!! 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're basically forcing people to pay now, and raising their prices at the same time. Even after deleting notes I am no longer able to create more still."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's the point of keeping this app on only one device? I left it both on Android and Mac."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"keeps everything together easy to find"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I downloaded this initially it was amazing. Then they decided you could only have 50 notes. Since then I cannot open this app to look at the notes that I have without three separate pop-ups. It is so difficult to do anything because I can't even refer back to the stuff that I've already written at a moment's notice. It was a good app at one point but find anything else at this point"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is just complete BS. So originally you can have 2 of your devices synced. Then out of nowhere, it's now 1 device.. with no added benefits to the subscription. Its all the same just adding more devices. The free version serves no purpose for that matter. They just lock you out and force ads to subscribe while accessing only 50 notes. Paying $100 just to access one extra device is complete waste of money. Deleting Now!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This company needs to listen to it's long term paid users. The price increase for features a lot of the community does not want or need is to the point of being laughable. Give us a decently priced version without all the stupid features most of us will never use and don't care about."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've installed it years ago because or some random guys on the Internet said it's good for the notes. It was not, random chaotic notes with zero structure and mostly pain. Now the amount of pop-ups made it completely unusable even more basic notes, I am happy to finally switch and delete this forever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of free service and use hundreds or thousands of notes and ideas are being held hostage by this garbage company. Don't believe their lies. If they don't mind stealing my stuff; they are certainly selling it to anyone who will buy. Stay far away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best note and record app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime it is failing, when you try to open a note it get stuck, sometimes it doesn't saving the notes, when clipping is very slow, a piece of really bad software, and the same on desktop app. Price rising for features that I don't need, more than 10 years using it, now searching for alternatives, you lose your more loyal customers being greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 устройство для синхронизации, навяшевые предложения перейти на премиум, Сложности с оплатой приложения из России Дико перегруженное, тормозное приложение (на windows прям вообще беда)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a pretty decent app, until the company started pushing users to upgrade and made the app unusable - CONSTANTLY prompting to upgrade, suddenly limiting the number of notes you can create, then only allowing it on one device. No, I'm not going to pay a yearly fee to use the software that had been free for a couple of years. I'm just going to transfer everything to OneNote and delete Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"PLEASE FIX NOW !!! I have updated the app and now it won't even let me even see my notes or edit them without first paying for subscription. It is impossible to get out of the 'Subscribe Now' screen. I need access to my notes ASAP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ten years ago this was a five star review. It used to be a really good note taking app. It had everything you needed. Now it's bloated, constantly wants to know your location, and much slower than it used to be, despite the advancements in smartphones the last ten years. With the recent price hike I really can't justify using Evernote. Just finished moving ten years of notes over to Google Keep/Docs - which I had to do manually by the way - and cancelled my subscription for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App or Web, only allowed to use it in one. I used it to keep small notes. Google keep is way better. One can try Proton Pass as well. Will copy my notes to other platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"9-2-24 update: Now I cannot access my notes. I cannot be more frustrated with Evernote right now. If I knew I'd be cut off, I would've downloaded my notes. Now I cannot access them unless I pay 14! 12-09-23 update: I can't create a new note unless I purchase the premium version! Are you serious?! I have been using the app over 10 years. And at least let me finish the year. Now I have to find a new FREE app to scan and organize my receipts for just a few weeks to finish 2023. Not cool, Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"worse every update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stay away from this note taking app. Have used for many years and each year it gets worse and worse until now it is pretty much unusable. They also changed their plans and have locked out many features. Every time you open the app you get hit with 3-4 popups asking you to upgrade..... Every single time! Hot garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You need to pay for everything this is trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a great app years ago. Now it's all advertising and wanting subscriptions. The advertising is super annoying. I'm not sure why anyone would want to spend $180/year for a notebook subscription."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a great app. But, I lost everything because I'm being forced to pay to retrieve it.. So many great free apps out there that it's not worth paying for this."

Empezó a molestarme todo el tiempo con que debía comprar, a punto de volverse inútil. La usaba muy de vez en cuando, no justifica pagar lo que piden. Ahora quiero dar de baja la cuenta y no puedo, no encuentro la opción y tengo que lidiar con el bloqueo de dispositivos porque me manda a la web y cuenta dos dispositivos. Muy mala actitud!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2014. I have YEARS of notes stored, but now I can't even navigate between pages without getting 12 different ""pay popups."" I get that services need paid subscriptions to survive, but the level of annoyance to even access existing notes is absurd. Plus the cost is much too high when cheaper alternatives do so much more. I'm moving notes to OneNote, where I already pay $72 / year AND have full MS Office 365 suite, no need to use this anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You cannot force old users to subscribe who already have notes saved, you should at least give access to old notes, it's very irritating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years. Used it for write offs and mileage, grocery lists, and even random thoughts and quotes and deep musings. It was nice as a free app. Then they started limiting free accounts to one notebook and a maximum of fifty notes. I stopped making new notes and could see the writing on the wall. Months ago they reduced the allowable synced devices from two to one; I couldn't access notes on my phone. I bounced; on OneNote now. No limits. Free. Pain to switch; I'll never look back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why do I need to log in with a Google account or Apple account? It's a note app... Should be just that"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I know you have to make money but the incessant nagging to upgrade *every*single*time the app is opened was driving me crazy! Found a way better alternative app today in Notion with more syncable devices and options for a much better experience so goodbye to Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my review from 5 Stars to 0 Stars. I have used Evernote since 2015 & it was THE BEST! Then in last month I couldn't use my Notes & received reply that I can only use 1 Device & only 1 Notebook with 50 notes. I deleted Notes down to 35 on 1 Notebook on 1 Device. Now I am unable to get into any Notes without paying. Evernote has locked me out. It has been 2 weeks & Evernote has not replied to my request for help. I am locked out & unable to see important notes unless I pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Note even let's you see your data if not paid. I really have trust issues with them and going to close my account.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm editing my previous review. The recent updates have fixed some of the things that were increasingly irritating over the last several months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After having used Evernote for almost a decade, I've decided to delete my account. The changes that have been made over the years have been increasingly in poor taste. From changing the layout, to poor optimization leading to slow loading times, to having to scroll down your list of notes everytime you exit one, to barraging its users with popups for a paid subscription. Every change seemed designed to push its original unpaid users away. A bitter end to an app that was once so helpful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been a very good App for me and does wonders if you keep it current. Good Notes IN, Get's U Good information when needed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be an amazing app; the best available. After 10-15 years of loyal use, i was betrayed in recent years by limitations that barely allow for functionality. Such a shame to destroy a piece of programming art such as this with pure greed. They would make more money by charging by tiers rather than all or nothing. Keep your stripped down free BS. Then Tier 1: $1/mo gets you 2 synced devices. T2: $3/mo gets you 3 + 1 added feature. T3: $5/mo all syncs & most features. T4: everything else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to view my old notes without payment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this for over 10 yrs n loved the app. It was perfect for organizing thoughts, planning work, notes, or whatever I needed effortless over multiple devices. They started charging & I understood, but I was still able to use a few devices n all of my notes. I even signed up for two years of unlimited cuz it was only $55 for a year and then $75. It jumped to $134 that was too much. You can only connect 1 device now and they limit the notes you can access. It was good while it lasted"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked me out without warning unless I pay 14.99 per month. Lost information, poor app in the first place, l only used it because it was free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"thus is stupid, I keep only list and I've had it who knows how Long I wake up and one day it doesn't let me see them unless I pay! give me the option to access these important notes I have first to remove them because no I'm not paying 15 for something I could've just wrote down! and not even a warning of when it'll happen either ?! this is probably how they make their money by forcing it !"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why not free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New ownership totally destroyed app. I used to use Evernote quite frequently, however, I find that now it is no longer usable. As I was trying to use the app today, I counted 8 annoying interruptions and built-in advertisements from Evernote trying to make me overpay for such a basic service. I get that they're trying to make a profit, but the app has now become totally obnoxious and has utterly driven me away. No thank you."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be good and I've used it for nearly 10 years now but it has been losing my offline notes when I go back online. I initially found it had randomly switched off offline notes but even when I toggled it on in settings, in the last 2-3 months notes I've written are missing chunks of detail/partially deleted, leaving a partial first sentence. I'm shifting all my notes onto another app so I don't lose my work again."

Now, Evernote holds past notes hostage and prompts for a mandatory subscription. I'm never paying to use this app. Just use Google Docs or a different note-taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Glory days of this app are long gone. Trash now. Basically has no useful functionality from 100s of free alternatives. Typical greaseball behavior."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a customer for YEARS, and have paid a fairly high premium for what's been a more or less an easily searchable ""catch all"" of information for me. They are increasing the annual price by $60 - Almost double! Goodbye Evernote! I could have purchased more reliable software over the years with what I've invested annually with you. You're proving everything that's wrong with software subscriptions! I'll bet you're hoping most won't notice the increase in time to cancel their renewal!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now there are an unbearable amount of popups advertising premium, they removed syncing more than 1 device to force you to pay for the premium version and the new UI is clunky and annoying. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be good but now rubbish"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,". its awful .. all they want you to do is get the paid version everytime you go on ... and its terrible experience. I'll carry around paper and pen before i pay that much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fine useful and free app and you could link your smartphone to your computer. Now it loads a screen that says I have reached my limit and must unsynch one device. AND there is no way to get past the screen to even see my existing notes. Evernote sure seems more interested in antagonizing customers than in encouraging them to upgrade. First they limited the number of notes (thankfully grandfathering our excess) but now even blocking access while we are syncing to one device."

No warning given that we weren't going to be given access or needed to reduce the number of notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Have hundreds of notes in it. But it doesn't work as it used to. I can't reach my previous notes easily which is disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant even get to the notes I have without paying, very disappointed, would give 0☆ if I could. Used to be 5☆. The app has been my primary note app for years. Markup of images used to be standard, now you need to pay for premium. The sketch tool has some improvements, but it occasionally drops a sketch completely or blacks it out. The previous revision was better overall. Adding a monthly bill for the premium app is not in my budget at this time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App wont take card payments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Turned into a disgusting money grabbing app and seems to be setting landing screen to capture individual by stealth"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im a long time user, maybe 10 years, 5000 notes. I even subscribed to Premium last year when the ads wouldnt stop. And no it's only getting worse. The notes often aren't smoothly in opening or even when I write in them they Write over each other. Super dissappointed. Once Premium runs out ill switch to a different Provider"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Paid version is just worth it, I think it is the best note app you can get with subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very laggy, not what it used to be. been using Evernote for over 10 years and it had gradually got to the point where it's too clunky to use uniWill migrate to Obsidian when I have got enough mental capacity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app. Absolute cash grab. All my notes in hostage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used for many years, but it has transitioned to a subscription app with a barely useable free version. Much too expensive monthly fee to simply take some notes. The free version has become limited and inundates users with pop ups and tricks to try and get you to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yıllardır severek kullandığım uygulama. Yıllık fiyatı 69,99 TL den 2.069,99 TL yükseliyor. Bu nasıl bir kafa acaba. 30 kat fiyat artışı dolandırıcılıktır. Resmen art niyetli bir şekilde kazanç sağlamak bu. Şimdi verilerimi nasıl ve nereye taşıyacağımı düşünmeliyim."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"cant even access any of my notes at all now because you cant even do anything without having to pay, this is the worst note taking app ive ever seen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a good free app. You can now only use it on one device at a time now using the free version, your notes are limited, and it constantly presents you with popups to pay for the app. Use OneNote instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy (often discards changes if internet connection is poor), and expensive for what it is. Better alternatives that are also cheaper or free in some cases"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years. Now they want to charge you instead of keeping it free. Alot of us or not financially able to pay. I have things still in the Old evernote that I'm not able to remove or delete.😡😡😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now the app really block you to access your notes if you dont buy the package."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new upgrade is horrible. Can't even find my old notes. Are they deleted, lost or corrupted. Big loss. Edit 31/08/24: This app has become mostly useless and limited to one device. There are so many popups that it can't be called a productivity app at all now as these popups drain a lot of time. Notion app has been my saviour and it was very easy to switch."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but has been sketchy at best in 2024 and now app will not even open and allow a login anymore - even after a reinstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the first time I have ever left a review on an app, but considering I've been a decade long time user of Evernote since 2011. I feel compelled to leave a review after opening it to take a note and finding out just now it's limited to only one device sync... I've put up with the constant bombardment of offers and discounts for a subscription. The increasing limiting functionalities, but this is the last straw. The corporate greedy push, forcefully trying to milk money. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nope! Appalling free tier.. It's an absolute nag-fast of payment plans ever time you open the app. Now you can only use it with one device. Just awful! The paid plans are way too expensive to ever consider. I'm finding an alternative. Such a shame since it used to be a good product many years ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote. I even paid for a while once it was no longer free. I really enjoyed synching between my Android, iOS, and browsers. But it is much too expensive for what this app does. I'm angry because I have so much of my information in the app that I now have to manually export. This user interface is no longer optimized for touch screens, the paywall pop-up is REALLY annoying, and the free plan keeps getting more and more limited - forcing legac users to upgrade or lose everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use to love this app. Used it all the time. Now I hate it. I am constantly bombarded every single time when opening the app to upgrade. Then they also force me to unsync a device which I had already done! So I can only use on my phone now instead of phone & laptop because I won't upgrade!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The popups asking me to subscribe are relentless. I'm only keeping this app long enough to find somewhere else to move my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now when I use Web version, I need to sign out my app version. It is just because I am free user. This is unacceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app since 2013. The app used to be good, but has become unusable with the latest updates. Unable to access old notes, the app gets stuck at the subscription screen. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used evernote for years, but I'm switching to another solution because of the endless popups and inability to synchronize two devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without any prior warning how can you change terms of free usage. I couldn't pay that much thats why opted you. Its been 9 years of note taking i have on it. You can't deny basic service which you promised. That is a trap. I should sue you to trick me to buy your app subscription. Either restore the basic service or lower subs fee for developing world. Otherwise this relationship is gonna end now 💔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting from bad to worse. Can't even edit simple plain text properly... Seriously need to reconsider your priorities..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for a decade. I used to love this, but recently , I started hating it. They have made a lot of changes that make it hard to use this app for free. I also have used premium version. But this app had too many bugs. It was slow to load. Zero customer support. I am looking for an alternative app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Lot of bugs with the software. Finding it very tough to use it accross multiple devices. I purchased a 1 month evernote subcription and then my account got deleted due to a bug. I tried reaching customer care but no response. I belive notion is a better app offereing similar benefits. And it is free too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pop ups every moment using asking to pay? only 1 device can use? what happened to the good old days...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier evernote was a nice app. Quick. But for more than a year its slow and sometimes unresponsive. Too much note sync conflicts is constraining me to look for another apps. Even if I am using a note only on one device, then also conflict arises. Really annoying. Additionally upgrade option and offers are popping up too much. They are cutting features which were once free. Thats something irritating and unethical. Time to say good bye to evernote. 'Google keep' is a good free alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"More than a decade using this, and now it's trash. What a horrible way to treat their clients. A pop-up for basically mandatory payment for web use and phone use. What's the point now? I had a screenshot for this, but there's no option for me to upload it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App only Blackmaling for Money , i can't Access my Data , when i was stored my notes its free but now i cant access now , its horrible things ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They steal your stuff and won't give you access unless you pay for a premium plan you never wanted nor needed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extortion. That's all I have to say about Evernote. It used to be a wonderful app. And I can totally understand developers need to generate income. And I would gladly pay for an app, but at this price? And then locking you out of the free features? ps. Sign up for the 7 days free trial, migrate all of your notes and then uninstall this damned app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote was once an amazing app. Came preloaded on my PC so figured I'd download it on the phone too to keep tabs on things easy. Nice interface, easy to use, until it became more complicated and bloated with paywall ads for no reason. Now you can only have one notebook, on one device, with only 50 notes. This subscription based thirst with developers is getting ridiculous. Be better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why does the app reset to home when I'm in middle of a document but need to use a different app for something? When I go back into Evernote, it reopens on the stupid home page and I've lost my place. Stupid. BTW... I'm a subscriber so this isn't for the free version. Maybe allow sync options so it's not constantly syncing unless the user chooses."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Each iteration of the app degrades user experience while price goes up. With so many alternatives in the market with much better features I have bitten the proverbial bullet and migrated to different solution. Good bye, ol' friend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"In addition to big price increase, why are we no longer able to set the widget homepage as default?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Thank you for years of making hundrets of notes. Now we are separating due to devices limits but I will remember your work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. Expensive and doesn't open half the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Its not improving with time. New company & platform sort of suck. First was the huge slap in the face by abandoning Linux desktop users ( I was told ""oh, you can just use the web version"" which isn't the same & cannot interfact w/ local files in the same way, plus doesn't work off-line). The new UI sucks. I was unable to select multiple notes (e.g. to move to a notebook, apply common tags, or delete) and its slowing down. Looking for an alternative and migrating 10+ PAID years of notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for almost 10 years, now looking for an alternative. Over the years it has become slow and bloated with unwanted features, and increasingly nagging about payment plans. Now the free plan only supports a single device, Evernote is no longer useful to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I had previously given the app 5 stars, but I've dropped it to two because clipping from the web is no longer working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become absolutely obnoxious with its pop ups. Finally deleting it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst after they have introduced heavy graphics and animations... Using to much memory on my laptop and not smooth experience to be honest. #bringbackEvernotelegacy"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but since the latest update, I can't access my notes without a subscription. Will move to Google docs instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Baaad baaad baaad, last update is so bad!! It's need wifi connection to open the app!! Subscribe promo pop it in evrey touch screen!! If I want a subscrib the app I'll do it without showing me this annoying promo every second! The UI is so confused to use! I rather use the simple note app in my device better than this an annoying app 🙂"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved the app and I was willing to pay for it. The support ghosted me with my questions about billing. I was unable to purchase it in my domestic region, the US price are enormous for me. The limits are terrible and I am unable to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot use the free version without the address screen. Very annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for many years and have suggested and installed this app for over 20+ people around me. unfortunately over the years the quality of this app dropped considerably, becoming very slow, not working after updates, not synching while I use VPNs and many bugs but the last straw was when they reduced synching to only one device for free version. thankfully I have found a better alternative app and transferred my data and I will help friends and family to also delete Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total rubbish is this App. Constantly interrupts the very thing you use a Note app for.... fast creating a note. Incessant pop-ups stop you from making use of what should be the simplest app on your phone. Do not waste a dime on trying to upgrade to the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I want to use my free account and understand I have to delete several notes, but those notifications about paying premium are annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hello, marketroids, changing plans so you can ""sync"" 1 device? Using app from desktop and mobile WAS main reason to use it. EVERnote, you see. Not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor response times, lay out not efficient and requires too much selection and run around to resume other notes. If it's more complicated and slower than turning through pages in a hard copy notebook-- then what's the point?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why do embedded links to websites within notes no longer work?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't live without it. It organises all my disjointed thoughts conveniently. I've never had a problem with the app. Just perfect! Update: my notes are now being held hostage as I can't view them without paying for a subscription. 9 years was a good run. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used and loved this app for years, until suddenly they wanted to charge a fee for it. Actually went to access some stored data one day only to find I was locked out; had to pay or leave. Why did you have to ruin a good app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All of the good reviews of this app are back from around 2019, the same time I posted a five-star review originally. Since then the developers have pilfered their user base without remorse. Their strategy is to purposely fabricate unusability in the app upon a certain threshold of time and intellectual property investment by the user to such a degree that they are veritably forced into paying $15 a month to even access their intellectual property. I would warn anyone considering this app to not."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was really useful and organised until they started putting an ad for the premium after your every click. I want to open the app to look at a note real quick but I have to click through multiple ads telling me how the app is better if i pay money. At least let me close them for good, not this ""remind me later"" nonsense. And the limitation to the amount of notes you can create is nonsensical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without any prior warning each time: limit to 50 notes, only 1 device allowed device, and now no access to my notes and info without paying for a subscription. Evernote just keeps getting worse and their communication is absent. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great note app but now is actually unusable with the aggressive attempts to force users to pay. Have switched to an alternate free app now as Evernote actively seems to be blocking access my own notes and Evernote going to require an Internet connection to access them (which actually makes it useless to me at times)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was free... used to have better interface than standard Notes. Now other things on my phone can do everything this app can. This app locked my off notes though. Totally not the way to get me to support you with my money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You just went from 5 to 1 star with your ""only 1 device"" strategy. How do 2 devices hurt your business? Well, your strategy hurts your business, bc I just switched to protonmail with a full payed 2y subscription, bc they aren't sneaky as you! Goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Still being pestered for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't open the app any longer. I'm in Canada and when I open the app it opens to a paywall. I'd have to pay a subscription to continue using it. Unistalling"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ludicrous price increase!!! Absolutely ridiculous! How can you go from 3.99 a month to $8.99a month!?!! All these upgrades and I don't even use them! I have my entire life notes on here and I feel taken advantage of. YOU NEED TO KEEP A BASIC VERSION!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love app and used for years. Latest updates have ruined it. Now my notes randomly disappeared while I'm actively editing them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Is there still a free version of this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Has really depreciated in quality over the past year or so"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable app. Always asking for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for years, gradually more and more annoying pop-ups trying to get me to pay money to use a notes app (absurdity) and in the last couple days, those ads have become unskippable. Literally ""pay us 15 bucks a month or you cannot have access to any of your stuff on this app anymore."" A real-life scam. I see others are experiencing the same thing. Cut my losses and uninstalled this garbage. Please never download this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To the whoever give back my notes! You have hijacked my notes and are now FORCING ME TO PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION to which I don't want to pay! I realize I have reached my limit. I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE NEW NOTES! The notes that I do have however are very important to me. So kindly remove the forced subscription & give me back what I have. Btw I have empty notes in what I have! So unlock me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Needs a themed icon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Strange problem. Evernote doesn't support Google Play Store subscriptions. I tried to opt for yearly subscription using the website. I entered card details and all tick marks are in Green. Still the system is not proceeding further to allow payment. I get an error message with a multiple character code. First app I see where there is a struggle in making payment. Very strange."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All these ""updates"" are not improving the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years now without any problem and suddenly now upon opening the app all I see is a stuck screen that shows 'Share logs' and refuses to move ahead. Someone has mentioned reinstalling the app solves this issues. However it's a horrible look for a trusted company to release a buggy/botched update on an app that was relatively stable all these years. Looking for alternative note apps now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. This used to be my favourite app and now it has to be one of the buggiest apps. Instant regret at trying to return to Evernote. The desktop version is great but the mobile app takes long, gets stuck, and bugs and glitches in so many places."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Scumbags stole my info and are holding my information as ransom. You are criminals and should be sued for this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having this app for years, but just recently, the ads to subscribe to it getting worse, it basically forcing you to pay. I wouldn't recommend this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"STOP ASKING ME TO PAY FOR IT!! IF I WANTED TO GIVE YOU MONEY I WOULD! I DO NOT WANT TO UPGRADE, IM HAPPY WITH HOW I USE IT AND DON'T NEED TO PAY FOR THE UPDATE!!! STOP ASKING FOR MONEY EVEYTIME I OPEN THE APP!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was good but now it's trying to force me to pay to use it by constantly having a subscription thing pop up so you can't use the app. DO NOT USE!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In recent times, this app has become a headache for simply checking the existing notes. Multiple times within a fraction of 2-3 sec it keeps popping up that free limit has reached. And upon deleting some notes, still same issue... Really very disappointing...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been using it for years. I found it of great help in managing my to do or to remember list. Now they charge per month or year. They have locked all my notes. Thinking what to do now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is not a free App Don't use this Evernote, Unless you willing to pay for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience, I have notes saved to this but because I've reached my free limit they are no longer allowing me access. There is a pop up for the paid service that appears literally every 5 seconds making it impossible for me to access what I have written. Scummy way to treat your customers, even if I was interested in the paid services I wouldn't use them after seeing the way this company operates!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app but...like everyone has requested a thousand times remove the default auto settings on the camera...please!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overall a good app but task reminders do not appear in the notification drawer. Not working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unusable. killed by design. sold out to even greedier insane ppl who pop up add and make it unbearable to use with a convinent 1000$ a month fee for one device eff off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App is basically useless if using the free version. It has virtually locked me out of my notes with a nag screen to update to the paid version (14.99/month 🤯). If you can channel the right energy and the planets align just right or something, then I can get in and use my notes. Needed one urgently, and at that moment, I couldn't get past the nag screen.... 🥴 Save yourself the headache and download any one of the thousands of actually free notes apps instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is virtually unusable due to subscription advertisements constantly popping up. Paid versions are very expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Easy to use. Exhaustive features. One of the best digital organiser tools one can have. Dark theme. Something's wrong with chechboxes after update. Free account only allows 1 device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app. I've had it for years. Then they monetized, which is understandable. After that it became trash. Not because they monetized, but because literally every button you push brings up a subscription menu with progressively more difficult buttons to find to bypass the subscription. In the many years of owning a smartphone, I have never once written a review of any app good or bad, which should tell you how mind numbingly infuriating this app has become to operate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible business practice. I was charged 78 dollars for a service I did not authorize. I poured many ideas and thoughts into this app only to be told I need to pay to access or continue to use. I stopped using this app for more than a year only to see a $78 charge appear on my card. I'm paying interest and my dispute was denied because paper work was supplied as proof of Evernote being able to deduct my Google account. This is bull and I hope there is a class action lawsuit to address this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm having the same problems as many others with Evernote. I've had it for a long time and was satisfied with the app until this past year or so. I'm constantly spammed with subscription pop ups everytime I click something. It's almost as if they are trying to trick you to subscribe. The new organization system is horrendous! Please, Evernote, go back to the way things were! Until then, I'm un-installing. It's become very aggrivating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome. been using it for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm done with this app.. keep forcing me to subscribe.. bye2"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable. Been happily using this app pretty much since release but the developers are now doing absolutely everything they can to force you to pay for the ""premium"" option. The app has gone from a free service with optional paid extras to essentially a free trial for a subscription only service. It will take me a long time to export all 13 of my notebooks and 228 notes (created long before the 1 notebook and 50 note limit) to a better service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be the best at one point...now it's the worst..there are better apps put there. Too many pops if you wanna check your notes.. It forces you to buy the premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just installed the app, wanted to check it. App opened, first page of it blinked for a moment, I saw smth like hey let's complete your set up etc BUT after 0.0001sec app closed by itself. I am reopening it but it doesn't work. Are your mobile Devs stupid? I can't even open your app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps getting worse...especially since Bending Spoons came on board. I have been trying for 30 mins to get it to load on Chrome."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but I am fed up with the constant changes made to pinch a few pennies. Greedy company, don't waste your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Find a different notes app, (Google Keep Notes is solid). Been using Evernote since 2010 & now I cannot create new notes. They still let me delete old notes, but can't make new ones. The Evernote environment is a dead end. They will pull the rug out from under you & limit access to the notes you've painstakingly created."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is with the bullying? I have used the app (lightly) for years and honored the agreement. Your freemium agreement! Why are you holding my notes for ransom? Stealing my intellectual property is just another bully tactic - like a 2nd grade bully. If bullying is not OK for kids, how is it OK for business? You are a criminal, and I hope you sleep well knowing you stole from the people that trusted you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this aap is so useless as long as you don't pay on pro it's completely useless it restricts basic things like my Laptop is damaged and I had that account there .. now everytime I try to login in my phone evernote asks me to upgrade to pro just to see my written data 🤨my notes are wasted on this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Seems like a very good note and message app when you learn to use it. would be helpful if there was a tutorial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really disappointed by the company choice to keep sync only 1 device.. 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"So many changes, some better most not so much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and it was 5stars... Now all my notes are trapped on here and I can't use this stupid app cos it is forcing me to pay for the subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful! Have had free version and now I can't access my notes without getting paid version because they pop-up for subscription won't go away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good notes app, but now the free version only lets you have 1 device synced, and you can only log into a new device 10 times a month - meaning it's not really possible to switch regularly between your phone and computer. The app also spams you with lots of ""Get Premium"" popups while you're using it. Not worth the hassle, switching to Nimbus Note instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant add pop ups dos not let me work!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A simple app for syncing notes across devices, but now it's loaded with pop ups to pay for the premium version and you can't even sync any devices! Pointless. They're charging more than the entire Microsoft office suite for an app that does less than OneNote. Just go with SimpleNote instead. It's free and doesn't harass you every time you open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every update is a mystery of what's being added and/or broken. Thankfully my subscription is about to expire."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app sucks so much. The developers hate a good running up. Every single update screws up everything, actions stop working, app crashes. I often have to install and uninstall, which is not even funny. I only use it because my job is stuck with it. Right now, I can't even see my previous notes, I can not search for folders. Everything has been having issues since the last pushed update. Please developer, just stop updating, it messes it up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it free for years on my computer, phone AND tablet. Then one by one I lose access. First my tablet, now my phone. So what good is it? Oh, I know, it's can't be used free anymore. Money is more important."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to really like this app but it's awful now, constantly trying to get the user to pay for it and restricting functions and capacities that used to be free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"false advertisement. promotion claims free. blocking to force payment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can see why there is a surge of one star reviews. As soon as I move my last few notes to Keep Notes by Google I will be kicking this app to the curb. Good luck everyone 🍀"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I once gave this app five stars. Now I give it one. They have made it so you have to have a paid subscription or you are severely limited. Even on long time users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i can not login to app . how i can export my data ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much promotion intrusion. Look elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely slow and annoying app. I'm going to get rid of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this app for about 20 years, I can not get access to my notes without paying for a subscription. This was always a free app, like so many others. Don't get caught in this trap and stop using this dodgy app. I can see from recent reviews that the vast majority of ratings are 1 star. What a joke Evernote has become since being bought out by a greedy company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update = Horrible. Won't load anymore. I use Evernote mainly on my Chromebook so my usage is now hindered. Not happy. AND I pay for the Professional version!!!!! Is the problem with how the Developers test this product, ie not testing on the range of platforms that are available? Am a user/customer of many years. Please do better. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love my Evernote, my external brain"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is good and usefull to continue things through several devices. Thing they killed with the new update that let's you use only ONE device. It is not worth the ammount they ask for. Will simple uninstall and use other app. This one is useless now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible, it's now essentially a scam. Do not use it if you have not started. The app claims to be free, but after a while, just when you put all your useful information in there, you'll be blocked from accessing it, without warning, unless you pay. This is robbery in every sense and criminal. I'm waiting for a class action lawsuit and hope they'll go out of business so that other people won't become victims!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This application has become obnoxious to say the least, with it's absolute demand for credit card information hi monthly fees for effectively a notepad and it's owner perception that it thinks it's a great collaboration tool, is a joke."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good.. after last update it's been reduced to 1 device only (defies the purpose for me) or start paying a seriously overpriced subscription. Even the closeAccount flow is made excessively difficult. Anyway, over to better alternatives that offer value-based pricing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2014. It used to be my go-to note app. Now that previously free features I used to access are behind a subscription and the bombardment of popups to purchase said subscription makes me despise using the app. I barely get into my notes without having to move through the ""don't miss out"" deals. Moving my notes elsewhere. Don't bother using Evernote unless you're willing to subscribe for all the features, it's not pleasant for free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be my go to note app, now I avoid it. The app bombards you with pop ups and subscription plans. Every offer Is for a limited time only and if you select no, the app always prompts you ""are you sure?"". The UI has become so frustrating. Now I copy all of my notes over to the free Google notes where they just let me do my thing in peace. It's probably worth the money for someone who wants to use the advanced features, but for the casual note taker, I don't recommend it at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant add notes as have no more space left, delete half them........no you need to subscribe!!!! Copied n pasted them to another app........see ya!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage. I got a new phone which put me over the device limit but I can't remove any devices from my account because I'm over the device limit. Used to allow web logins but now that counts too apparently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I tried for an hour, doesn't worth the try, and they try to make it impossible to cancel it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Product managers are adding so many ""bells and whistles"" that Evernote makes it difficult to keep simple lists and notes. In short, the Evernote team had made the once-useful product into a complicated app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such an irritating app. Doesn't let me read my notes anymore and keep popping upgrade plans on my face everytime I open it. It has become so infuriating. I really need to find a way to move all my notes to a better provider. I have reached my limits."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"CRIMINAL. They give you basic free notetaking app and you put all your important notes in. Once you put your trust in keeping your notes in Evernote, they make PAY pop-up go ALL THE TIME (you can click back but the pop-up comes up again immediately), making it impossible to see your notes that include important stuff. Basically EXTORTION. This shouts CLASS-ACTION SUIT!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I love Evernote and have well over a decade of notes, some irrelevant, some incredibly useful. I don't mind paying. Just setting the scene here for you: I'm a positive customer. What's happening right now is every time I log in on my phone, a whole load of downloading and processing. I don't need any downloading. I shouldn't need any downloading or processing. What's going on? Is it a bug? It's not actually opening today at all, just processing and downloading. Please update asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait & switch. Was free now they want money. NOW I'M LOCKED OUT OF MY ACCOUNT. Don't sign up unless you plan to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like the organizing of the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I HATE this app now. It used to be wonderful, I've used it for a decade probably and now it makes my blood boil. I absolutely hate when companies get bought out and they completely change. This app glitches constantly. It wants you to pay premium to add a new note now. I get 3 pop ups asking if I want to upgrade per click. It's so annoying. I can't seem to transfer my notes to another app easily. Even copy paste gets messed up because of weird formatting from Evernote. Don't use this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing 5 star to 1 star, they limit the free version to 1 device so that can't able to use in mobile and laptop. Need to migrate the notes to another app. Goodbye evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Удивительно тормозное приложение"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I had Evernote for years. Now they want to charge 14.99 a month which is extreme. They have locked me out unless I pay. So now I have all my info locked. I will not be paying. It's way too much. Very disappointed in Evernote. Apps have hopped on this trend to charge monthly to gain access, its all about the money. I won't be the one. I'm pretty sure I can find decent note app for free. I'm good. Thanks but no thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"googal keep notes and other useful software are available in totally free and gives unlimited space and features so don't install this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years, and I always thought the $69 subscription free was high, but not out of reach. Now the price is doubling! No, thank you: the app is not worth $130. There are plenty of free options out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why be forced to pay for features you can get for free using Microsoft OneNote? I've used Evernote for years, the free version, ane OneNote is so much better. Glad I transfered my notes over before Evernote locked out my access, unless I pay for a plan, which is extremely shady. I'd give zero stars for that reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overrated piece of S H I T I can't even find my notes on my Android smartphone using this bug ridden app I canceled my subscription and decided to subscribe to an awesome Android organizer called: EZ Notes - Notes Voice Notes The logo is a Blue Birdie 🐦 Subscription is way cheaper with EZ Notes plus it's 💯 percent reliable. The EZ Notes editor and features are incredible! I can even use EZ Notes to export my notes as PDF, import txt etc! subscribe to EZ Notes - Notes Voice Notes It's 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app and paying for it for 12+ years. This latest rewrite with bending spoons is terrible. Constantly 'processing your content' every time I open the app and having to wait 10 minutes to use it. Complete disaster. I've had to reinstall the app and resync a few times. A shame. Time to start assessing other options"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They want you to pay for this app now and I can't even access my notes at all anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Era bom, mas depois de 12 anos de uso, fizeram uma atualização que não permite que clientes/ usuários antigos utilizem a versão básica em 2 dispositivos."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All the pictures in notes dissapeard in mobile app, everytime you want to quick view something it keeps pushing to pay. Dark mode not usable, i used evernote for years now, but today i'm quiting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want to pay for your app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was one of the best softwares I have ever used, but recently it's performance drastically reduced. It started giving lot of issues like not opening at all, notes list coming but note got getting opened. it has gone from 5 star to 1 star rating. Hope they will fix it soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"May I use your app free? I can't see my records, Notes, even any memory? When I installed your app with the condition for free, You don't give me more space but retain my memory visible, please 🙏🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love ❤️ it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my 5 star review from 2013 to 1 star. Every year it's getting more expensive and less usable. I keep all my personal documents in here. Travel, taxes, mail. Every action to organize them on android takes like 10 clicks and bunch of scrolling. I really need to find an alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Generally good, does what it says on the box. There is often a lag though when opening notes with a poor Internet connection. I would register the paid version if it were a one-off fee instead of an unreasonably high monthly subscription. 2024-08 update: changes to sync policy makes this app unusable for me and removing the notes export facility is cynical exploitation. I will continue to use this for my historical purposes only. Changing review from 4 stars to 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Switched to Zoho Notes. Free syncing between Web Version and Smartphone App. On Zoho Web > Go to Profile > Scroll down to ""Migrate from Evernote"" > Select 1 year (or however long you want Zoho to sync Evernote content with Zoho). I used Evernote a decade, but it has stripped away features until now I can no longer access my notes between my Computer and Cell Phone without paying. I understand that Developers need to make money, but I just can't justify another expense with good, free options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed with limited device policy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was my favorite notepad until the paid in subscriptions and the maximum number of devices. Honestly can't remember the last time I used it. Moreover, these constant reminders of signing in to Premium packages can be stressful at times. 😓sigh..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly just not worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The design of this app gets worse and worse, I'm going to consider switching services when my subscription is up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps translating into Welsh, very disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"very slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the worst kind of app. They cut your access to even look at your own data in order to monetize. Shameless trap app. Stop being evil"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer a worthwhile app, they went full greed, asked for high prices, annihilated the free tier. My reccomended notes app is Notesnook, it's great, encrypted, and you can take back your privacy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"now remember that our downloads, recommendations and reviews are who made your app big, now we are limited to our notes and devices and you keep asking for money, well better apps are available and I'm switching"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had a really great experience with this app until they started shoving their subscriptions down my throat. Also, only 1 device is able to be synced at a time? Are you kidding me??? I can't use my phone or laptop without disconnecting one of them! What a joke this app has become... Incredibly disappointed..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I remember loving this app years ago but now it's virtually unusable. I have to jump through hoops just to log in, and it's taking forever just for the app to load. Will look for an app that is easier to get into to actually use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly awful now. Pop ups every 5 seconds, lags, limited to 1 device. It's no longer a viable app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Used to be rock solid. Now, it sometimes doesn't retain the note properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: they keep stealing away features in an attempt to get us to go premium. Note to the company: I'm not paying for anything unless you come up with a more reasonable price. $130 per year is your lowest price??? Are you insane? It's just as easy for me to move to free Google docs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now that it's not free, it is very expensive to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Міняю з 5 до 1. Експорт заборонили. У мене веб-кліппер для збереження статей та моб. додаток для їх перегляду. Раніше Еверноут дозволяла безкоштовно користуватися двома девайсами. Тут я маю блокнот з рецептами, котрі збирала 10 років. Я вважаю, що дуже підло забороняти доступ до всіх збережених роками статей, та ще й надавати доступ у формі підписки. Якби це правило діяло з самого початку, то ок, я б прийняла до уваги. Але зараз додатком неможливо користуватися взагалі і це просто свинство"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app, now I have to pay to get my saved notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I consider myself a loyar user for more than 10+ years, but unfortunately I've seen how greedy you become over the years taking off features one by one for your premium users. Although there are a million way to get more profit but not like this Technically, it's impossible now to use the free version. Dropped from best to WORST note apps in my opinion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updating, this app stole or deleted a lot of my notes. I tried to do a search for them and nothing came up. This app is VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!! DO NOT RECOMMEND."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Does what it says on the tin and so much more 🫡,.,,................."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app that holds you to ransom once you've committed notes to it. You'll suddenly find it reporting ""limit reached"" when you just go to look at your existing notes on the one device you use the app on. You then have to pay to view them. Ended up being forced to pay for one month just to grab my notes and put them instead in Onenote. Then cancelled the subscription and deleted this awful app. Understand nothing is for free & wouldn't have an issue paying. But this app tricks you. Not good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The ad said I could get premium. For free and it's trying to make me pay 169$ for it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app in the world. You can't take a new note even. It says Limit reached."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Said I reached the limit, locked my notes and keep having this upgrade to a premium plan pop up. Not allowing me to delete or edit anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"way too slow and inefficient!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Ive lost all my notes because it still says i have to pay. The app has gotten progressively worse the last few months. Today it says limit reached and I have to pay. I haven't made any more notes for a long time. I'll have to find a new app to put my notes on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after new update I can't retrieve all my notes! some very important. anyone know how to do this please leave a message"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A money dependent app. I have been using this app since 2019, but in the new update, I have felt that this app is dependent on money. I have directed my very valuable note to this app but now I can't edit that note. I am sorry for trusting this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is getting worse e every day. I was unable to access my account for an extended period despite being a long time paid user. I have always paid for several years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely nightmare with latest forced updates. Prompting to reduce to one device for sync and which I did. Uninstalling and migrating all notes to samsung so much convenient. No more rubbish pop up prompt. Sickening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"so buggy... I stress every time I use it on Android but feel stuck si ce I have so much content in it..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great until they hold your info hostage. And no way to regain info without subscription. Completely unethical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be the best. But money hungry developers ruined it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App turned into a greedy money begging app. It's an app to make notes for God's sake stop shoving paid options down my throat. Your ability to ""sync notes across devices"" is not special, stop paywallong for the sake of it. I don't recommend this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ONLY 1 DEVICE FOR FREE USERS! USED TO BE 2! It is basically obsolete for free users. Can't even create new note, unless you pay monthly subscription, which is pretty expensive. Normally, I totally buy and pay for apps that are worth it. But their high subscription price isn't worth what the app has to offer. I like to support developers but this feels like huge bait and switch. I am switching to Google Keep or other notes app. 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's becoming very bad and annoying. The app opens and dissappears right the way and the page is only white."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it autoscans photos for text. no other app as solid as it, like onenote, does that by default. I can't beat it, and I tried."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I absolutely love this app! I've been using it for years! Though, of course, it comes with bugs. It is what it is. However, when it comes to the widgets with the 1x1, I don't have the option just to open Evernote. With the 4x1, you have to pick 6 buttons, and there is a button to open Evernote. Why don't I get that option with the 1x1 widget? It makes no sense. Also, every time I open Evernote, I don't care to see the patch notes. Give me the option to not show again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app forever deleted it when they had space limits. Had to re-download it to look for info and it wouldn't let me see me notes unless I paid for a subscription. Too bad used to be a great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For some reason this app is forcing the creator to choose an upgrade not allowing Access to Notes already created. There has to be a glitch and it is A very big problem. So no glitch, I'm just late to the party. After reading other experiences with Evernote is really disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for many years and loved it. Only used it on my phone. Noticed a bit back couldn't add a note which I accepted. There were only a few notes I cared about. Now today I suddenly can't even get to my notes without paying for a subscription. No warning this was going to happen. I need the info and can't access it. This is BS! At very least I should be able access the notes that I've had forever without needing to pay to get my own information. Used to recommend but no longer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Moved to Obsidian and never going back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful app that is useless and impossible to get rid of. Honestly, this used to be a good way to store useful stuff, but now every login is met with a tsunami of subscription requests. It is tricky to use, with a UI that makes organising notes harder than it needs to. Then, you try and leave. Good luck with that! If you have the app installed every time you try to enter the final code on the website it just opens the app and you're back at the start. Worst. App. Ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No support received for an issue being faced (one of my notes I spent 3 years creating got wiped), even though I'm a paid user... will not recommend to others and risk their crucial data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started using this app more than a decade ago to keep simple notes. Over the years it has turned from a simple note keeper to a horrible bloated mess that asks for money with each click. The free version has now become unusable where it now asks you to choose between the web version and the app version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even go through or share my saved file bcz there add for premium version pops up every second.its disgusting atleast let us go through our saved files.iys pathetic.😡😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app ever since they forced people to go into membership. It kept on popping up to pay for membership every 2 seconds while I was trying to search for a note. will deffenetly change platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't get access to the application while offline it's so infuriating. It's totally unacceptable. The app and notes have to be always accessible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's wrong with this app? every second it shows me an ads for a paid service, I will get rid of it forever,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good, snappy and responsive. They increasingly made ads more and more intrusive. And after the redesign of the app, it starts up slow and the app is very unresponsive. It runs like my phone is 10 years old. I will be switching to another app. This app is not even worth paying for now with how slow and unresponsive it is. At one time, when it was still good, i considered paying for it, but due to the enshittification I won't out of principle. There are better note apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be great. Now I can't even have 4 notes without paying a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have using this app for more than 5 years and now i am switching to other app, it was great untill now. Lately app is keep showing up popup to buy premium version which does not make sense to individual user, atleast evernote should allow minimum 3 device web mobile and tablet. Thanks once again for your support till now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Decision to limit to 2 devices was bad. Limiting you to only one is beyond dumb as it defeats the point of a cloud storage note app. Pricing is ridiculous for a note app and features are not worth it. Acquisition by Bending Spoons drove this app into the ground. What a pointless loss."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Opening any notes is extremely slow after the update, sometimes ending in ""Note Unavailable"" which makes the experience of using the app very unreliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked out with no warning or time to copy my lists. Wants me to upgrade at ludicrous price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"im used 5 years and now we must paid.. worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Чем дальше, тем хуже. Перегруженный интерфейс, ненужные функции, плохая оптимизация"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't open. I cannot access my notes. Nonetheless, It was a very good app before the year 2020."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I couldn't uninstall it fast enough! So Joplin (my favorite) Upnote, Onenote, Zoho Notebook, and Google Keep are all free and after 5 years of usage I would owe nothing! But Evernote wants me to pay $100 per year ($500 in 5 years! )?? That's insane? Think about it, how many apps do you spend even $10 one time? Evernote in my opinion is ridiculously over priced. Even $25 one time would seem high for the app store. No thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Why is Evernote forcing everyone to upgrade by blocking all your previous notes with pop ups of upgrading, this is wrong and inconveniencing, I cannot access my notes because of your greed for money. Allow those who want to continue with the free version to do so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE:- I'm about to lose ten years and two thousand notes because of their destructive updates and 'improvements'. It is currently unusable. There is no export function. I'm using it to compensate for cognitive issues, if I lose those notes, I lose everything that I need to remember. Disgusted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden the app is not compatible on my device? Stopped syncing automatically and even when i tried doing manual still wont. Keep asking i update my email and when i try to, will get no result. Logged out and couldnt log in. Tried web and found out some important updates are missing. It last updated in march... This is the worst experience. Those notes are very important to me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After so many years it became completely unusable. Adds are evil. Switched to keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great until you started trying to make me upgrade. I'll find another password keeper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"horrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's gone from mediocre to terrible! Constant ads to get on a subscription plan. Constantly being told I have too many notes or too many synced device to try and it get me to upgrade despute using on 1 laptop and 1 phone. Egrigous use of dark patterns to hide the free options. Run away. There are much better places for your shopping list"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Restricted access to my notes with premium Pop up each time ....can not even copy my notes ...this is harrasment ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always crash... Taking time to load... Had to switch to onenote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very aggressive upgrade pop-up. I found ridiculously expensive for Pro version, as I don't need all features, or the PC version. Now it said that I've reached the limit and can't even access my notes and move them to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid. This publisher has no qualms about holding your information hostage until you pay their absurdly high subscription fee. The app used to be free, but instead of giving users an off ramp to download their stored info, they just lock it behind a paywall. Fu@k you Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using Evernote paid. Now I get a bug that the links doesn't open in the android version!!! If they don't fix until my renewal I will change to a more modern app. Had to turn off the automatic renewal cause this app is too disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can a app become worse with each update? Always messes up my notes with random changes, continuous pop ups & now they have taken away login for 2 devices for free version. Well done for digging your own grave. Switching to Microsoft notes !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scam BEWARE! Starts out free till you invest years of notes, then one day you add a note without any warning that you will exceed an invisible limit line before you start paying, and you SUDDENLY find your account hijacked and held hostage. Then until you buy their subscription you are locked out of all your notes. Totally wrong! They should not let you add a note once you've exceeded the limit without paying. Then you can choose to not add more notes, delete old ones or buy the subscription. 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Long-time user & fan here, great app with lots of useful note-taking featues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is asking to upgrade to premium and not able to access our notes. I am uninstalling the app .. sorry"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously free service now requires you to pay to access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I now hate hate hate this app! What they are doing now is allowing you free notes then they will randomly stop giving you access to your notes and force you to pay to access your notes. This is BLACKMAIL and is evil! Do not use this app!! Run away!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free version is to limited to be useable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used the free app since 2011 and synced 3 devices, my phone, computer, and laptop. It was amazing to access and work on files from different locations. Over the years, the number of sync devices has dwindled down to only one. The free app has turned into a glorified cloud backup unless you pay corporate prices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🏪❤"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's fake app, don't use this.. your mobile contact and photo will be not safe here. Also share this information to your friends circle not to use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless. Can only be used one 1 device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolutely brilliant, I use it every single day, a history of my writing, stories in poetry (whenever, wherever they came) All held within, waiting without! Evernote Forever! it does what it says on the box, love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"task filters malfunction on android after setting and unsetting high priority filter. after clearing all filters, his always shows 4 tasks out of 7 , 3 tasks are not shown for example"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't often rate apps, but Evernote's continued decision to completely alienate their userbase is exceptional. I paid for and used Evernote for years and loved it, but then they doubled their subscription price and made the free plan beyond useless, it's a joke. Don't reward this company with your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I grew to detest this app. They offer a free version, then hound you relentlessly to upgrade. Eventually, the free version stopped working and all my notes were held hostage to their upgrade shake-down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lol. There's no option to disable autorotate. I can't use this app when laying on my side. PUT IN THE OPTION!! WHY HAVEN'T YOU ALREADY?!? I don't support stupid companies. New Update: Can no longer log into EverNote. I'm in the process of copying & removing all my notes and I'm deleting this BS useless app that's now holding my notes as ransom. I hope your company dies a slow Blackberry death. Good riddance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time premium customers. Evernote has lost its way of providing customer values."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote but this year the free version of the app has become super restrictive and it's almost difficult/impossible to use because there are tons of super aggressive and intrusive pop ups ""inviting"" you to pay for the premium version. Not recommend at all and I am migrating now to other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for many years and it was great. Now with the unbelievable subscription prices I will delete the app and move on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for a couple of decades now. It's always been one of my go-to apps, and I am on a paid plan. Lately, though, the Android app has gotten flakey and unreliable. It seems like every time there's an update, I have to uninstall and re-install the app to get it working again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has slowly become worse and worse year after year, and has finally reached the point of being completely useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many of the recent reviews, I am extremely frustrated with what once was a very reliable and useful free ap but now I can't access my account to view my notes because I don't want to upgrade and pay an exorbitant price. I am locked out! I'm thinking of reporting Evernote to the FCC."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Listen up people... Evernote is back! I got my subscription back 2 months ago after a 2 yrs hiatus and I'm glad I did. What a night and day difference from the old Evernote. I've been seeing new updates and bug fixes almost weekly since I resubscribed. I'm digging all the new features and changes! Keep up the great work Bending Spoons I now have a great everyday note taking app the can go toe to toe with all the rest! 🙏 Thanks! 🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"thanks u guys god bless amen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app happily for 10 years. Starting about 2023, I guess they sold it (?) and the new owners decided to monetize the heck out of it. They said it would remain usable for free. Technically true, but only just. I left for a better app bc they got greedy and it got nearlyimpossible to use meaningfully. Glad I downloaded my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I observe that the app continuously appearing notification about subscribing. I cant anymore use the app properly. It forces me to subscribe and i lost the privilage to used the free 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has gotten consistently worse and buggier since the company was sold, and now it's going to cost almost twice as much? No thanks. Was planning to cancel anyway once Amplenote got a little further along in development, but this is the last straw. I've been using Evernote as long as I've had a smartphone, almost 15 years, and it's been sad watching it go down the toilet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I couldn't believe they won't let you sync with more than 1 device after the new upgrade. It took me a while just to figure out why I couldn't use my notes because they changed the policy and didn't say anything. Read the rest of the comments this app is garbage now. Finding a new one myself definitely recommend anything else over this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good on HTC Sensation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The employees of evernote are using One note. I heard that you hire top notch persons but I wanna give you some advice 1). Lower the price, 2). Add some extra features. Otherwise the company will gonna fail. Check youtube review ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The subscription cost someone right's ball for something Notion gives you for free, and now you are forcing me to have an internet connection to use it? The only thing keeping me on this app is that I like the home screen. But honestly, not worth it at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not even 2 devices anymore? Why??? AVOID!!!! Look for other option!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be an amazing free tool for years for having access to your notes on multiple devices, but over the last two years they've gotten incredibly greedy, using manipulative pop ups, completely removing multiple device access to notes for free users, which was the only thing it was good for, and now they want $130 a year if you plan to store more than 50 notes at all. I don't know who's running the app now, but they've destroyed it. Use Google Drive for free for note storage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to unsync my phone unless I buy premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""To continue providing exciting new features on Evernote, starting on 15 Aug 2025 we're increasing the price of Evernote Premium Yearly from € 39,99/ year to €94.99/year. Click here to review or cancel your subscription."" Thanks , really exciting! This forces me to say goodbye to evernote after 15 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great... now it's terrible. Can barely get on past notes I have made because I am constantly bombarded with the ad to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but since they sold it to another company, its quality has significantly worsened. And now they're even asking for money to use the app, same functions I got when it was with the previous company and completely free. It's really unfortunate, but it's best to use another app with similar functions and at no extra cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, many times unresponsive, unreliable, unwieldy, even on a paid account on the fastest of phones. I used to be a fan -- now an Evernote user for nearly 14 years -- but in that time they have lost the plot on what's important to users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Еверноут скатился. Пора переезжать на подобные сервисы"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of usage the app just writes ""limit reached"" and doesnt let to proceed without paying money. So my information is lost without any previous notice. Greedy bastards"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can't even read my privious data without premium. I was using this app since 2018 . Now I am going with Google keep. GoodBye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version sucks. 1 device limit makes it useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"had been using the free version of Evernote. kept getting popups when opening the app suggesting the paid monthly subscription version but I ignored them. Then in August 2024 the option to continue with the free version was gone and my notes were locked behind a paywall. I was forced to sign up for the monthly service at $14/mo to access my notes again. Will cancel and move on to an app that doesn't hold my notes hostage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update is completely broken. Won't load at all on my phone (Moto G power 2021). I pay for the pro version and I need it to work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open on phone unless monies for upgrade to premium.More garbage to be  trashed. You're locked out of account unless you give credit card information.  Good bye to this bullship."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years for free. Now they want 14.99. Forget it, keep your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use Google keep notes no limit Evernote keeps limiting it's accessibility."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote was great until it started requiring a yearly membership fee after exceeding an undisclosed number of notes. Deleted the app. I refuse to pay for this kind of app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped using it now due to constant pop ups for purchase of paid version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"As a casual user it's just not worth using anymore. First they cut down how many notes you could have now they only let you use it on ONE device. Pc and phone are too many....need premium for that lol. Ive been using evernote for over 6 years but leaving for google keep - notes and lists. MUCH better. Edit I have the same info on both - evernote 186 MB Keep - 43 MB."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"My notes are gone! Give them back! Sooooo disappointed in the app. It's also slowed down a lot. Update: Got my data back, but app still slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get worse with every update. Now they want to triple the subscription price. I'm your after being my note tool for 11+ years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I'm using this app since 2011, blackberry mobile days. All good, never faced any major issues in past years. Suddenly I logged out today automatically and not able to login again. Could you please help to check it or at least give me chance to download my 10+ years old notes before making any major change to app. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote is an invaluable tool. it has greatly improved my productivity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant annoying pop-ups asking me to get the premium subscription, most features locked behind paywall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Using Evernote brings me joy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no response from support to help me extract my notes...price is too steep to stay on basic plan and they won't help me to get MY DATA out of their system...bad bad bad 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Now, it is not even letting me look at any of my notes without paying. Untrustworthy. It's so sad that I had important notes that I cannot access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edited: Evernote is a terrible note app, do not download. Note: Free users can not access their own notes now, as the app demands you pay to edit them. DO NOT PAY THEM! Simply put your phone in airplane mode, and the app will give you access to them. Just copy and paste into a good note app (like Obsidian or NotesNook) and move on from this awful money-grabbing disaster."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For users reaching the limit of free version, why you have to put such intrusive popup making the app not usable? Might as well tell the user that their access is blocked due to your NEW motivation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Initially it was good now not worth . Please avoid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years.. But lately, they (probably) decided to get rid of free users... Every time u enter the app, its hard to reach your notes bc of ""buy premium!"" floating notifications.. They first let 3 device to use, than it reduced to 2 and at the end; just 1 device. U can't look to any of your notes on pc for example, if you have it on the phone... And mostly I pay for apps but their prices are also so high. So goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Virtually unusable now. Constantly bombarded with ads and demands for money, and now can only use on one device unless I subscribe! Syncing between devices was poor anyway. Won't be using anymore. Switched to Onenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"You really want me to review this right now? Evernote just tried to implement a caching feature to counteract the abysmal Android app startup time due to their Electron architecture by taking up more space on the device with unnecessary garbage, but the devs thought they said ""crashing feature"". They still can't touch the performance and reliability achieved years ago with 8.x, but TBH, I don't think they're actually trying anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There's an issue with the free trial where a screen demanding a subscription keeps popping up despite my not hitting the limit. I can't make new notes and I can't access my old notes unless I buy a subscription, so it's essentially become ransomware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Because of the fact that I can no longer sync to two devices and I cannot even export notebooks from the website, I need to wait for next month to export them because I reached my device sync limit. The monthly plan is not even affordable and is not worth the price. After exporting my files, I will no longer continue to use Evernote. This has been an annoying experience after years of being an Evernote user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have a paid version for over 10 years and now all the notes are gone. What is the point of having a subscription if with every update the app is getting worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"way too frequent updates, none of which benefit me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app to store my notes for my weekly Dungeons & Dragons game. Then the app started telling me I couldn't have more than 50 notes with the free version, and it wouldn't let me make changes to ANY of my notes, so I began deleting them. With 45 left, it still wouldn't let me make any changes. That was a couple of weeks ago. Now I can't even OPEN my old notes to read what was in them without upgrading to the paid version. Don't even bother with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I pay over $16 dollars to get ""premium"" service and I can't even login or talk to a person for help? I submitted three tickets and I use this app to track everything so this isn't flying well at all with me !! For $16 why can't u at least chat with someone ?? If I can't login to my account I'm gonna scream !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many pop ups that ask user to purchase premium version, made the app unusable. App is too slow and too buggy. It used to be a good product. Now is dead. Switching to alternative solutions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They locked my data and then wanted to charge me to retrieve it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since being acquired by a new company, the functionality of the app is in question. Long updates have caused bizzare loading errors and data deletings. I've had the app since 2014 and been a premium user. Only two premium plans exist and are very costly for a litany of features many will not use. There should be a third option above free to cater to individuals like myself who need synchronized note organization across devices and avoid the additional business features. Truly a tragedy to behold"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They used to be cool but have been progressively limiting the free accounts until they are useless, while not offering enough to make it worth paying monthly. Long time user , super disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have the paid version. The app USED to be great. It's now so buggy that it's unusable at this point. The new desktop version is terrible. It seems like every day, it needs to be updated to fix something now. I'm now completely unable to create a notebook via my phone as well. Just says error: unknown. Idk what happened with this company. It's now worthless to me. I'm switching to Notion ASAP and moving all my notes there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Revision: I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app. Now it's working. Prior remarks: App opens to one option: ""share logs."" Clicking on this goes nowhere. What this is is not explained. It is now impossible to access my notes. It is not possible to view, read or edit any notes. It is not possible to search for notes. ...What is the reason for rendering this app unusable?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since they charge now, I can only have one device on the account. The cost is extreme for someone keeping their recipes so I'm done. Apparently they won't let me export/download or otherwise keep my notes accumulated over 12 years. Obviously money is their prime motivation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Came back to this app to check if I left anything important. I kid you not 6 pop-ups asking me to pay and start a subscription in 2/3 minutes. This app used to be just simple notes, and now it's 60$ per year ON SALE??? FOR A NOTES APP??? WHAT."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"2024-08-20. Update. Melhorou, mas agora estou um tempão esperando o Evernote processar o meu conteúdo. Nunca vi isso. Porque não permite o uso e continua em background? Horrível. Evernote tem sido sinônimo de frustração."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sizin yapacağınız uygulamayı s... Para gözünüzü doyursun oe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pos app. Why does a notes app require subscription?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Strongly going good since 10 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Over the years it became more and more greedy and now I'm locked out of my existing free notes that I've had for YEARS because I refuse to pay for a subscription. I can't access them at all. It's too bad. I liked this app once upon a time, but their business practices are increasingly scummy and anti-consumer. I'll be looking for a replacement app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Threw its users under the bus"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a useful app. Why would you ruin all functionality and make the app impossible to use? Evernote has lost touch with what drew people to their product in the first place and has monetized it to death."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Adware rubbish. Can't use the damn thing because of all the popups offering a once in a lifetime never to be repeated 40% discount. Has degraded from a productivity tool into a monetisation engine"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hungry for money, product experience degrading. The management is so hungry for money that it has ruined the experience. Specially as a long time user with not as much volume but important notes are now not getting synced. And due to device change I lost important progress just because in their latest attempt of threatening me to subscribe they stopped syncing my notes to 2nd device. Pathetic! I'd rather be moving on to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Managed to look past the pile of obnoxious monetary requests every time you open the app for a while, but they finally made it so you can't even sync between two devices on a free plan, essentially making the app useless unless you give them $15 CAD a month. $180 a year for my needs (syncing notes between a couple of devices) is ludicrous, but there's no other options provided. Pushed me to finally find a better app, and I honestly wish I had done it sooner. (Joplin using OneDrive sync)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It does not allow me to log in anymore nor recover my password. I lost years of very valuable information."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even after being paid for one month upgraded version, my account is still showing free version So,I am deeply frustrated for not being able to use Evernote during my examination. They are not even replying to my mail for the last 4 days. No other way ,I have to switch to other app like Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Price is too high Rs 500 per month to be a prime member .... And even after few months u r not giving acces to user data for free ,,every minute popped up shown on screen to take prime membership ....pathetic ...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't force the subscription notification so much that even using the app becomes a nightmare. The purchase Window keeps immediately popping up when closed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely awful. It was always slow and complicated and the PC version never worked right, and now they have the audacity to charge for it. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This New Version Sucks!!! Please bring back the Older Version.. I lost over half of my information with the New Update!!! Cant even see my notes anymore. What a way to totally kill a app. I hate this App now!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Já foi bom, agora está horrível, péssimo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even open my notes and saved recipes without subscribing! Looking for a new note app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't Subscribe.. Cheating App... Useless.. Wants Subscription only.. App not not able to open it's irritating.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im done"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years and slowly they have been making it a worse and more annoying experience if you don't pay. I was fine with it until now, as now they even deny me access and I can't copy my old notes to take them somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this note taking app all the time for school, but the egregiously invasive monetization model has made it unusable without paying. Do not use this if you plan on using it for school or work. There are free alternatives out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ads after ads for premium plan upgrades, adding more limitation to free plans everyday (only 1 device, only 50 notes, 1 notebook ...), Im not gonna use it anymore after I've been using it for years cause it's so annoying to even open it once in a month to deal with upgrade plan ads, force to delete one of your devices, warning you that ""why you have more than 50 notes on free plan?! you have to upgrade"" like I had more than 50 when it was on free account!!! then you add this limit, uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware, this developer is not trustworthy. They may ask ransome to access your note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Revise as the free is not practical anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why force payment?? Need urgent files. So Bad Evernote. It is expensive. So bad it again. Bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible freemium model. Wouldn't even let me go through or manage or delete my existing notes after crossing the limit (never knew what this limit is / was). I get the business sense behind pushing for premium, but the execution is terribly poor for free registered users. You lost a potential customer because of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS WITH YOUR DATA. Bait and switch scam now trying to charge me to access my own notes. Under no circumstances should you use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've done premium many times and wouldn't go back to the free if I had a choice 😜 literally used to be my go to for creating documents and etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really great app, use it all the time. Edit: Not anymore! I hate this app! In the years since I started using it, they have reduced the number of devices I can use with my account. And now they won't allow me access to my own notes unless I sign up for a plan. I'm essence, they're holding my data hostage like some two-bit hacker. I am dumping this app as soon as I can."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Highly encourage everyone to uninstall, leave a bad review, and find a different note taking alternative. It is absolutely mind boggling that you can't use this app and also use the web version without having to pay a ridiculously high fee for what the app is offering. Super greedy move by Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I received an unexpected charge for what looks like an annual subscription to my Visa card. My subscription expired in 2018. Not being able to reach them for comment, I have referred the transaction to my bank as unknown and they have taken it up with their financial crime department. I don't have a sub and I'm not paying for anyone else's sub so I want them to please reverse the charge to my card and delete my payment method permanently from their system. They are not responding to any channel"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I could use this for free for years, now it forces me to get a monthly subscription, and I can't get to my notes :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it has great functionality but its constantly glitching andnot loading, i have to open and close the app multiple times before it shows DOWLOADED content let alone what i haven't downloaded. i have to wonder why im paying for something that doesn't work half of the time!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complicated from now, i will change to other notes, it is worse than pocket note when you already signed in other devices and you can't write anything with your current device. Then, what is it for? I rather use the pocket note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Farewell Evernote. Thanks for the past years. I am moving to another app since you are forcing us to subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gone massively downhill. Free version is almost unusable with the amount of popups. Development seems to have focused on workflow and task integration rather than a solid note taking app. Will be uninstalling and looking for an alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Still bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage! It won't even let me check my old notes without forcing me to upgrade every 2 seconds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"After a long journey with evernote, I had to say good bye. Suddenly you limit access to single device only. Looking for alternative app now Edit 19-Aug-24: Moved to another note appand uninstalled evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE 8/24: They are now forcing you to pay monthly for notes. After years of asking it's now forced. Absolutely crazy. Asks me to upgrade my account every time I open app. Very annoying. Was forced to use this app since LG doesn't have an integrated notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"AFTER 10 YEARS OF USING THIS APP & BEING HAPPY I'M NOW SAYING DO NOT USE THIS APP! SCAMMERS! NO WAY TO CONTACT & RECEIVE HELP! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHAT SO EVER & NO REPLY TO REQUESTS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BOTHER Love how you've completely destroyed your app because you're money hungry, gtfo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love the free version but is now literally unusable due to subscription popups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is getting very commercial nowadays. It's removing all the features one by one for free users. I'm going to uninstall this soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Echoing recent reviews... This app WAS amazing...but now AVOID AVOID AVOID. Used it for years. When they limited to 2 devices awhile back... Still managed through it. But recently... only to allowed 1 DEVICE? And make it impossible to switch logging in on separate devices without penalty. After being a loyal customer who raved about the product for years... I'll have to finally seek another note taking app and tell all I know to steer clear of this once amazing product!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer free. Don't waste your time. Use free notes app out there from Microsoft, Google, Apple or Samsung. Aplenty out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Holding your information hostage isn't exactly a ""good guy"" business model"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sudden paywall. Annoying app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is a scam. At first can use on many devices, then limited to 3 then 2 then 1 then limit unsync device twice a mth, now Ican use on even 1 device due to max reach, means I can access my notes for a month, ridiculous. They limit notes which means I couldn't creatr new note. When I want to migrate to onenote or notion etc, they make it hard to migrate, no straight forward method. Then I subscribed to it but still I am not able to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's really hard to be convinced to pay $18/ month for this app. If the price was $5-10 I would definitely pay for it, and I'm guessing a LOT of other people would as well. Simple formula: High cost=less customers, Low cost=more customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did marketting telling it's free and once you download you realise you have to pay after 2 Weeks even to open the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"New enhancements are very slow, cumbersome, and have a lot of glitches. Many times searching now indicate ""no results"" which is not true. Even tags indicate that there are multiple notes tagged with a specific word, but if tag chosen, it indicates no results, try again. I hope Evernote can resolve soon, frustrating! 8/19/24 - getting more and now frustrated, evernote Android is constantly having issues and freezing and functionality slow... Requiring re-download. Looking around now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app, the free version of which I have used for years is now forcing me to pay an exorbitant amount just to access my previously saved notes! No thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only one device was the final drop. I was already annoyed by the aggressive subscription spamming on every startup. Bye bye Evernote, hello Notion!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One device only? Two unsyncs per month? What a joke. I moved from Evernote to Notion because of the lack of functionality, and now it seems you gave me enough reason to make the entire switch and leave this app for good in favor of way better alternatives that aren't as greedy. Evernote was cool, now it's just desperate to survive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Agosto 2024. Ya no es útil en su versión gratis. 1 solo dispositivo y solo unas pocas notas al mes, además no permite ver las notas guardadas a lo largo de los años anteriores desde que uso la aplicación porque supuestamente ya se cumplió el límite Review original: ~~La mejor aplicación para notas y capturar información en general.~~"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing the syncing device without a notice! What a greedy developer! Be aware before even buying! Untrustworthy!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use on phone and PC for basics, goodbye..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fantastic organizational tool!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can only sync one device now. sneaky action to force you to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"After more than 2 weeks of being unable to log in on Android Phone (since 2024.07.29), the latest version (2024.08.19) seems back to work again as it should does, finally. Now from 1 star to 3 star, mainly because I am still 50% confident this app may crash again at anytime or on next upgrade. Please fully test the app before upload to The Store, or privide paid user option to view/edit notes on web browser. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has gone from really great to good enough to absolute garbage. You can now only have your notes on one device and only change that device twice a month. If you're looking for a free service where you can see your notes across multiple devices, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time here. I'm currently moving all of my notes to another much more reliable service and will never look back. Do you remember Pushbullet and PLEX? Probably not. Evernote is on the way out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app use to be good, but now it is almost useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So heavily monetized! Got tired of all the popups that im finally uninstalling and deleting my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is very heavy taking a large memory - over 250mb. It supposed to have simple, straightforward function by store notes. Worst, every time starting the app it comes with popup asking for upgrade to paid version... etc. Very annoying. In some cases it could not be used because of these popups! Finally I decide to delete it. There are many simple note pad app available with much lighter memory load and no popups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good enough that I paid for the $50/year tier. The new owners eliminated that tier and have been stripping features out of the free tier to the point that it's practically useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app till I hit my limit of notes and started getting spammed to pay. Can't even access the notes I currently have without being bombarded. Update: They keep reducing functionality of the app in hopes to get you to purchase. I haven't used this app in ages but occasionally go back to look at old notes. It's literally ridiculous and money hungry 👎🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I’ve been a loyal Evernote user, but the recent update has made it difficult for me to access my dates. It’s frustrating not being able to look at them anymore, and it’s affecting my productivity. I hope Evernote can address this issue quickly, either by reverting the changes or providing a way to view dates easily again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love Evernote. No more. Without warning, you can now only sync 1 device on the free version. First off, how about warning about this? 2nd, I'd be happy to pay for the basic features I need, but I don't need the massive amount of features in the pay version, and it's 2 expensive for what I need by far! A. Let free members sync at least 2 devices. B. Introduce a low-tier plan for about $6, with only notes, tagging, search, and text encryption. I'd pay for that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much money! They want $15 a month in order to keep their service. They blocked me from accessing my information. This is absurd!! It's literally note, come on people!! Guess I'll use the free one that came with my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Done with this app. Every time I log into the desktop version, it refuses to launch unless I install the latest update. New ""features"" are worthless and new look is cluttered with stuff I don't want to see. Worst of all, the price is ridiculous. $140/year to synchronize a few Mb of notes between a few computers and mobile devices? You're out of your mind. Uninstalled and deleted my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every month it just keeps being worse. All free users was cut with their abilities to save notes,to create folders, experiencing AGRESSIVE ADVERTS and NOW they just allows ONE DEVICE instead of two IT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL. Premium should mean upgrading experience,it should mean CUT,DOWNGRADING AND REMOVING ALREADY EXISTING FEATURES for other users Don't store with them any important notes. Someday they just will shut down every single feature NO SINGLE APP OR COMPANY SHOULD ACT LIKE THAT"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I literally can't access my notes on my phone without giving you MONEY?! I HATE YOU EVERNOTE. Im spending the $15, then im doing a chargeback and uninstalling the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to best become worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"it has proven to be a value tool in my life's efforts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage app. Get any other note organizer. I'd rather my 4 year old niece manage my notes out of her coloring book"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why all of a sudden, Evernote is asking me to pay and will not allow me to see my notes?!?!?! Asking me to delete synced devices? I only use it on my personal phone!! The other devices it says are synced are not even around anymore, and I'm afraid if I unsync, I will lose all my notes!!!! This is not right! I need to access my notes!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Когда-то был классный софт. Теперь пользователей просто кинули"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be 5 stars but now... It used to be my goto thing for all my ideas etc. For a few years now, the Android App has become laggy, and slow. The editing tools are hidden under layers. For a week now, I am unable to connect more than a single device on Free version. Unable to create new notes as new restrictions have been placed. I wanna pay, but the prices are unjustifiably high. Would they make the Android App better in coming weeks or months if I pay? Not sure"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gets worse and increasingly anti-consumer with every update. New egregious monetisation model strips back features that used to be free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful experience. 'Free' aspect of account is extremely limited. When you have reached the limit you are informed via a popup that you cannot close unless you subscribe, thereby essentially locking you out of any notes you may have saved. I lost everything on here without the option to even look back over what I had. If there's something I've missed it was not made obvious. I would not recommend at all based on my frustrating experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After increasingly aggressive adverts over the years, I'm now locked out of accessing notes on my phone unless I subscribe for £8 a month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not recommend, especially after cancelation sync on 2 devices (free version). Lags, missync and only for paying clients"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before this, Evernote is my number one app for notes. Then after the two devices limit, OK. But after one device limit, it's kind of OK-ish, but you keep send me “limit reached” and “unsync a device” even though I only use it on one device. After that, I can't access my notes. So rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: my antivrus has quarantined this as malware. This company is a joke. Over the years this app has taken free features and put them behind a paywall. It now does not even sync between devices, the original feature that made Evernote special, without an outrageous subscription fee. They lowered their cap on how many notes you can have to an absurdly low number. With plenty of competitors that are cheap, free, or limited, I intend to switch to a more reasonable company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a good app once. Then the developers started moving previously free features behind a paywall, piece by piece. At this point, the app is functionally useless without paying through the nose for the features that drew me to this app, that were originally free. Even if I thought the app worth the current prices, I wouldn't be surprised if the rates keep climbing, even while functionality drops."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now pop up window does not allow to even read old notes so annoying. I don't recommend this app as was using as simple notebook but now it's useless without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I first used Evernote in 2015 when I started university. Since then more and more features have become locked behind subscription, to the point that the app is unusable. There is nothing special enough about it to stop me from switching to another note app. I hope the obvious greed destroys it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The most ridiculous signing in and asking if I'm a human. I'll try it the app but if it's anything like this then the IT dipsheet who made this ought to be asked if he's is human"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bahut hi Ghatiya hai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucks now. Sad. Way too expensive and many features I would never use. Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Right now, my Evernote app won't let me type more than 4 characters in a new note on my Samsung S23+. They send me endless instructions to close absolutely everything in the background. I can't figure it out. This is not on me anymore. Evernote better fix their broken feature. It works great on my MacBook, but that's only half of why I need it. By the way, I have the paid professional version. I'm looking for something else now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When it first came out, it was good. Now it's absolute trash. You can't open the app without being BOMBARDED with them trying to get in your way to BEG to buy their monthly or yearly subscription. I've counted 5 different popups strictly from Evernote that you can't get rid of to see your notes you've had on there back when they were free. Horrible app now. I'm currently moving my 1,000+ notes over to Androids basic notepad. Trust me don't download."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get your notes off this platform to somewhere like joplin or nextcloud notes while you can. They are getting held hostage with an obserd limit of 1 notebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"End of an era of using Evernote, I am using this app to keep my notes for many years but now it's not possible to open my existing notes without paying....it's pathetic user experience. Allow users to open their existing important note and restrict the new notes creation after subscription. Uninstalling with a heavy heart."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After a recent update the app is unusable. Used to be an amazing note taking app, used to keep all my passwords and important stuff in it. Now you get bombarded to upgrade to premium and can no longer access the info stored. I can't even delete an old note to make room to avoid the pop up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible, I had to pay so I can have my notes back, I'm leaving as soon as I can export my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote now forces you to only use one device and doesn't work well on cellphone browsers. It's a cash grab and I will look for another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Continuous ad for membership."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for approx 5 years. Now all of my data is not accessable unless I pay a monthly fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed ruins a great app! Uninstalled!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"bro let me delete notes shared with me. tired of seeing them clog up my notes, such a simple feature to ruin this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love using this note service until my notes were locked for not subscribing to their monthly fees which isn't cheap either more like $15 a month for basic NOTES!! ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used and recommended Evernote for over 7 years, but removing 2-device sync in the free version is a poor decision. A note-taking app that doesn't sync is nearly useless, especially with so many alternatives available. I'm switching to Trello, which offers free syncing and more features. Evernote, you've lost a loyal user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent from a service point of view. Now, it turned out to be a scam. After trusting this app and saving their notes in it for years and years, users are now experiencing more and more limited access to their notes. Next time, you won't be able to access your account unless you pay for a subscription. That's a backstab ! Run for your life ! I'm using Microsoft OneNote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since 2018..it was good in the beginning..but since last year the ads to switch to premium were getting out of hand ..had too many notes in it so didn't uninstall it...but now I have finally took the time and switched to another app...also the company is smartly not allowing us to delete our account... anyway I've finally uninstalled it.. gladly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Use to be a good free notebook app. The past 2 years they have gotten less & less features remaining free & now that I can only have my current device as a synced device rather than 2 devices a few months ago or even 4 devices about 2 years ago, it has just basically turned into a forced subscription app, as they slowly remove more & more features. Guess it is time to start looking for a different app. I have been using Evernote since 2017 & I guess all things must come to an end..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot access notes, they keep them hostage unless i pay, there is a pop up blocking everything. I have 2 devices and previously for all years you could use app for free on 2 devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get to my notes, said I have exceeded my space. NO WARNING!!! FOK OFF we have your information. Said to unsync devices, didn't realize devices WERE synced. All I want is MY data. Read the rest of the comments sounds like a money grab, that's fine I can appreciate that BUT no warning??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Para ödetmek için çok fazla kısıtlama getirdi ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Utter rubbish, nobody download please . I had the app for more than 4 years, I have a few things saved there now I try to open it it says limit reached, and needs me to pay £9/month?? You should have let customers know about this before hands so they can retrieve any info saved if they are not willing to pay ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was such a great note app. Now the developers have become greedy and put every little feature behind a paywall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rip off app. Reduced limit of number of notes on free version, so I deleted loads to get within limit and now rarely use it. Just tried to access remaining notes and it won't let me unless I subscribe. Uninstalling!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app was great and super handy. I have had it for years. Then in the last year or so they are essentially taking away features (that were for free for years) and wanting me to pay for them. This is pretty poor form in my opinion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Free Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lol sync to one device only"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"if i domt want to subscribe why you guys pop up ,hang profile ,unable to open my old notes,Dont force us to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EDIT: IT GETS WORSE. FREE USERS ARE NOW RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE DEVICE. Evernote is a disgraceful shadow of it's former self. Every update, more features are paywalled. A free user is strictly limited to how many notes they can make, and limited to a single notebook so you can't even organize them. You can't customize the home page, so you're stuck with a clunky layout of features you don't even use. Every time you open the app it asks you again to pay, and not just once but on a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Apka nawet spoko. Ale to.przypominanie natrętne żeby opłacić subskrypcje jest nie do zniesienia. Co 2 sekundy wyskakuje monit. Nie da się pracować. Odinstalowana."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editing my rating from 5 stars to 1 star. Honestly I have been using Evernote since 2014 and now it's becoming annoying to use with all this subscription pop up. Honestly go find a new and experience marketing people to do your marketing, this pop up and quota of VIEWING (not adding more notes, but viewing notes) are really annoying and it makes people uninstall this app. Honestly, I will uninstall this app once I transfer all my notes to other app. Good job Evernote 💩👍🏿"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Made one note and saved it, opened it to put more info, I was redirected to an advertisement, which would not let me delete. Installed, never again, unbelievable...😠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money Grubbing BS. I spent 1hr extracting all my notes to get out of this thrash. Best time spent. Enough said on its sticky prompts to upgrade. Waste of time. Get out of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have used this Evernote for quite some time and finally I have reached my maximum quota. Now I am forced to pay subscription otherwise I cannot open my past notes. In other words, you have made my notes as hostages!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Mann.. U really should do something about ur app. More updates bring this once a very good app to ridiculous app. Go read all those massive 1 & 2 stars ratings. Fire the CEO & the dev team. U guys do realize that ur competitors out there offering more flexible app with multi platforms sync in many devices n they charge 0, right? I will uninstall this app asap i hv pasted all my notes to Notion. Ur app is rubbish 🤣 will happily see u out of the competition soon enough 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become trash. Can't even unsync devices now honestly who decides that that is a good idea? When you get a new phone now what are you supposed to do? This is seriously garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Use to be a really good notes app but not so much anymore, ads, buy this, buy that, have to go through multiple pages navigate though garbage to get to my notes, simple was better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote since like, forever, even paid the OG level of subscription which currently about USD 10 per year, using it across the board of Android, iOS, iPadOS, MacOS and Windows PC devices on personal level. But, since I got reminder from Google Play that the same subscription level I paid from 8 May 2014, will become about USD 80 per year, this is the limit I can pay for Evernote. I'm not sorry, cancel auto-subs, transferring all my Ever-notes to Google Keep, Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This WAS a great app. Sufficient for what I used it for. Now I HAVETO PAY! This is ridiculous. Just like the ARTICLES I can read, if I pay for them. This is getting outrageous . Internet is just zapping the life out of people! Now, someone tell me how I can get my notes back? Or are they gone forever?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for 10± years and, despite a recent changes restricting me to one device rather than one account, hoped to continue using the app on my phone, or to copy the information to another program. I closed and deleted Evernote from my tablets, but cannot access my information from my phone because I cannot log in due to the paywall created without warning. I have only 1 account on 1 device. Still, I cannot access my account. please advise"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"freemium plan got reduced a bunch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great when free. Made me pay 15$ just to access important notes. Do not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had Evernote for a few years, connected to 2 devices for free. The latest update only allows 1 device per free account. This app no longer serves any purpose for me. It used to be easy to take notes on my laptop and refer back to them on my mobile phone. Not anymore. Guess I am searching for a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"been using for life of the product, key tool for work and home. Old version could not edit very large notes on Android tablet or phone but this was fixed early 2021. Biggest current gripe is that font size is to large impacting note reading on phone as well as tablet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"**Temporarily work around to access your notes** Airplane mode on and wifi off. Then you can get to your notes without blocked at the subscription pop-up. If your note is not available offline, click the little checkbox to download when online. Close the app. Airplane mode off and wifi on. Back to the app, try access your note (and will get blocked) but the info will be downloaded. Repeat the steps about airplane mode on/ wifi off... you get the idea. Good luck getting off this ransomware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bye Bye Evernote! Used to be the best, but went severely downhill with their annoying pop up ads and promotions and their latest ""upgrade"" reducing the number of devices, number of times you can disconnect a device, and their greed for money. I will say good bye forever. Hope you go bankrupt Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now it is below average for how slow it is, limited features, etc. The nail in the coffin for me was when they took away device syncing and only allowed me one device per account... It's all locked behind pay walls now 🧱"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A few weeks ago the app started to block everything because it says that ""the free period has ended"" I've been using it for 13 years and now they want to charge me for taking simple notes?! You ain't getting a penny from me! Pro tip: download all your notes, put your phone in airplane mode. Now pass them to Google Keep. Let's hit them where it hurts!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The most annoying paid plans that pop out every second. Cannot do nothing on the free plan. The worst notepad tried yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for about 15 years. Things have changed it is now horrible. It was so bad that I was forced to remove all my notes and start using a new app. I've read this from many other users as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app hasgone to sh**, constant paid plan advertisments and updates that are making the quality of life worse with every update. uninstalling and moving to microsoft one note (this shows a lot)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Been using this for years and now they changed their policy now my notes are hostaged because I sync between PC and phone. There are better alternatives that will offer better security and has more features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not stop forcing ads down my throat. I previously had the paid version but it's way overpriced for the service it provides. Painful app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app- as to mirror others. Sadly for me when trying to unsyc devices(neither of which were my current device) I guess I lost all my notes. GONE. I tried logging in and it eventually gave me the option to email myself logs- which is all code I do not know what to do with. I guess I should have never trusted this app with that informed as I do not know how to recover it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will now move on. After many good years, Evernote now became like modern MMORPGs, Pay to win. Will miss you, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very useful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never expected this much of issues, was a best one not anymore...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads for upgrade is annoying. Switching."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why not only 1 device sync?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's even worse now, as I can no longer access my old notes. You can't use without paying $17.99/month! Just gross Evernote was great until it limited the amount of notes to 50. Now it's completely useless. I refuse to pay $100+ a year for this. Goodbye. I'll find something new"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just keep downgrading the app for free users. Don't get it. Years ago it was my app of choice but right now I'll just transfer my notes somewhere else because the limitations are getting ANNOYING, plus how much they beg you to become a premium user with an annoying pop up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is an awful predatory company. Avoid at all costs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit - 2024 and I'm revising my old review from years ago. This app sucks now. The pop ups are so frustrating and hard to close. The cost to upgrade is crazy. Looking to move off the app, such a slow, clunky experience Edit 2 - can only sync one device!? And a limited # of times to switch the primary device? Feel like Evernote is trying to make the experience so annoying that your notes are held hostage and you have to pay. Nope, moved all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the worst note taking apps. Used it for 3 years but the constant pop ups for premium became too annoying. Even after I migrated and kept only 1 note out of 50 free notes in the app, it still showed advertisement for premium every time I opened the app. Becoming frustrated, today I closed my account. Rating is -5/5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Try Notion app. After being frustrated with Evernote, I started looking for alternatives. So far it has most of the features+more. Migration is easy too. Every time I used the Evernote app, there's a pop-up for premium. The new UI is horrible and very slow. Now I don't like to even use it. With each update, Evernote became a tool which I loved to use, to one I hate. It has gone from being simple to use, to a frustrating piece of mess. It's now just an archive my old notes. WTH limited logouts"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Minimum excess on free basic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm so disappointed that there's a device limit. I'm really angry that I can only use this app on the first device now. Garbage application. I'll never use it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote could be great, but the latest update only allows you to sync to one device for free, defeating the purpose of cross-device syncing. I'll be looking elsewhere until this comes back!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful. They made free version literally unusable and payed version is rediculously expensive. Why would anyone pay for that when you can use OneNote for free. Beware!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Paid version looks nifty, hence an extra star. Free version has no features that you phone's built-in note app doesn't already have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the free version is a joke, just use one of the many great free alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been with Evernote since the beginning of it's existence. Now I'm unable to retrieve important notes that I've taken. I keep getting a ""Unable to retrieve note, try again later"" here we are later and I'm still unable to retrieve my notes. And I pay monthly . UPDATE: I just canceled my subscription with Evernote. The price increase has almost doubled. I have found a better app for less than half the price and offers more functions. Loved this app at one point. Very dissapointing 😒"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nobody gonna buy your premium no matter how much you force them by poping those irritating ads. It's been so many years I'm using and I've to shift now and my all data is there can't even view properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After more than a decade, I have given up on this app. Over the years, the developers have made more and more changes that have ruined this once great note-taking resource. I understand that if you want all the bells and whistles, you have to pay for it, and that was fine since I wasn't using them anyway. Now, however, features that used to be standard are being taken away and added to the premium version, and the price of the premium version is astronomical and very much not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increasingly forcing us to use only 1 device when there's plenty of great free note apps by Felicia"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no comment"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. But now it has abruptly become useless unless you pay an exorbitant fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful app. Gets worse every year but I'm too lazy to switch. Do not recommend. Do not download. Leech company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for 10+ years. New pricing requirements too expensive for my limited level of use. If you plan to use it a *lot* across 2 or more devices/platforms, and can afford the new pricing it may be good for you. Syncing is virtually immediate. If you have live network storage, OneNote may be best. [I used it extensively when I was still working ;<) ]"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update blackmail sucks I'm a long time app user on S23 I am furious with your data device limit for free users. I was editing a long note and can't access ANY of my notes on ANY platform because of your stupid notification insisting that I have to upgrade to a paid plan. I can't or wasn't given an option to delete/edit a note or unsync my old phone. I lost 2 months worth of health PT notes. Maybe you can put in a little warning or 30 minute buffer before locking a user out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"* App doesn't open after last update & I can't get to years of notes!!!!! I am VERY upset! I hope the developer can fix. * In response to the company reply asking me to contact them, I did. No resolution to my issue yet. I still can't access my notes!! *** Now I can access my notes again. I'm still leary of the system freezing again. ***update: Now DEMANDING I sign up for a minimum of $14.99 monthly subscription. I can't get into see the packing list I was using last night to pack! HORRIBLE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Nice app far too slow on mobile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am a paying user for many years, but once more the app stopped working. Like a couple times in the past, I had to completely wipe and re-install the app on my phone to get it working again. annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks Evernote for these last 12 years of working with you. Your previous free version was great. Now it's time for me to leave and find new apps to save my notes. Uninstall..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The desktop version is working fine, but the app on my Huawei tablet is just laggy, takes too much time to sync notes, and becomes too hard to work on. You are the worst guys, limiting notes size on the free version and the app works fine then, but forcing us to subscribe to get the premium features and when we do so, and note become big, the app become laggy and crabby."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now, it seems, you can only have Evernote on one device with the free version. I unsynced my husband's phone, then got a new phone for me and somehow used up the LIMIT OF 2 TIMES you can unsync in a month. Now NO device will let me see my notes unless I upgrade. It gets better. You have to to PAY TO UPGRADE in order to contact customer service about the above issues. I have important info in that app. I wish I hadn't trusted it as a place I could keep it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a cheap app. They first want ypur data in it and then lock it. U always regret afterwards."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a useful app but the last year or so they have been really hassling to upgrade. Now I can't access any of my notes without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was forced to pay to access my notes accumulated over the past 10 years to download them! Now I'm trying to cancel my subscription and these criminals make it impossible to do so! I went through their process and after providing my reason to cancel I got another page offering a 40% discount that you can't move on from! They give a list of reasons to choose from so I tried them all, no luck! Unbelievable! Stay away from this app! l'll lodge a complaint with Google to delist them if no response!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been with your company for more than 10 years. All of a sudden you're holding my notes hostage and strong arming me into subscribing to your ridiculous prices. Why? Not cool. I recommended this app to hundreds of friends . I need my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy! We've used the free version of Evernote for years and now it won't let us access our notes unless we PAY! DO NOT USE EVERNOTE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for forcing to make premium. I have successfully uninstalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good, now it's horrible. Can't access until I pay for an upgrade. Says I reached my limit. I really only have one notepad for personal information and I've deleted countless notes from the past so that I would have room and it never fixed the issue. Now I can't access at all until I upgrade. It's an effing notepad app. Get over yourselves. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too greedy, can't sync even on only devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's paid app please make it free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horror! Once it gets youur notes .. it can't be used, is screaming for money money money! Total Fail!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I loved it until they started making to deny the membership offer....then you had to deny it twice...now they basically force it and lock you out. I got 6yrs of business stuff on there that I'm now forced to pay to retrieve. Which is fine....but messed up how they handled this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous. Have been using Evernote for almost a decade now. More and more things got cut from the free version, and now with the new update that only allows one device to be synched, it logged me out of my account on either device. I can't log into it even on my ONLY synched device, with Evernote claiming that I have too many synched devices. Guess Evernote is not forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update is tough to use,it lags a lot.Plz get the old version back. When i try to use bullet point,it does not show.It is very difficult and inconvenient to use. Also when I open the app, it takes forever.i still love it though since i can schedule my notes well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So finally time to switch since the free version allows only 1 device and constant push for premium is infuriating. Adieu"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app I've found. I use it for everything every day!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a great app once, now is the greediest app EVER! I used this app since 2019. I was so naive that I believe I can access my note for free forever. The name Evernote is a joke now. From a free app to limited number of notes to limited devices. Not even can access one note on my phone now unless subscribe. Stay away because this app keep your notes away from you until you paid $78 dollars a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Вы достали своими настойчивыми предложениями перейти на платную версию. А ещё взяли, и отключили возможность использования 2 синхронизированных устройств. Теперь в бесплатной версии только 1 устройство."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a paid subscriber and can't log into the web version because of buggy login screen. The email response to my ticket item was atrocious! I don't mind paying for the yearly subscription but the web application is just as important to me as the phone app. I can't trust Evernote if they can't get the basics of a simple login screen right! I also hate the useless features they keep adding to make Evernote become bloatware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid Evernote – it's incredibly annoying now. The app bombards you with subscription prompts and won’t let you create new notes unless you pay. On top of that, they can access all your notes, which is a major privacy issue. It’s not the reliable tool it once was. Save yourself the frustration and stay away. Many alternatives, allot !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Still too many annoying and problematic issues with just basic notes that I use all the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tras* app doesn't even allow you to delete the account Probably some Indian company scam *hit of an app Don't download it and Google should remove this *hit of their platform!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's disgusting, whenever create a Note, the bottom ribbon vanish. I've to close the app and open it to see bottom options. If it's not a temporary glitch I will definitely Uninstall the App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has been with me so long as if it's my little brother that I don't see often but will keep tabs on. Through the restrictions and forced choices I stood by. At this moment there are no choices left, no restrictions left, and no free version left that can be used. It would have been better if Evernote pop up and gave a time limit to subscribe or take this month and say goodbye. Instead I felt like a slow boiled frog that adapt to the situation without realizing the END has arrived."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's borderline unusable without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"don't fall into their trap, my notes are trapped in evernote now and I can't access them through my phone, each update made it harder and harder to simply access your notes, this last one changed device access and now it won't let me access notes at all through my phone, they are held hostage from my phone unless I pay them money. It tricks you with this ""unsync a device"" message twice that doesnt work and then locks you out of access on your phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled and stopped using it after the change to only one synced device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login.....😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was paying customer but now have to switch to Notion. Android app is extremely laggy on my Pixel 8 Pro. The most annoying thing is when I click any note and it doesn't open and I have to click multiple times or restart app. You should fire whole development and qa team for such bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been with you guys for a long time and have loved it forever till as of lately. I wouldn't have a problem with a monthly fee but $14+ a month is a bit much! No sorry not gonna pay it. But you jerks have this stupid popup where I can't get my passwords off here. Once I get all my stuff I'm out. So disappointed. YOUR PRICES ARE TOO HIGH AND YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN REPLYING TO ANYONE'S COMPLAINTS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constand popups, less and less able to use it for free, and very frequent bugs as well. I'll be changing notes app soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"At first I loved app and didn't even mind the limitations of the free version, but now I can't even get into my notes because it says I can only have one device syncing, but it will no allow me to unsync any devices because it said I can only unsync 2 every 2 months. I just un-installed the app and lost all my notes. TOTALLT FRUSTRATED"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full of spam, used to be good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2013 but not the free version is broken. They no longer let you edit notes, so when making my grocery list or my list of things to do, I have to make a brand new list everytime. The app is complete trash now and most things I'll be using Google Drive for now. Money hungry creators asking for over a hundred dollars per year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Nagging has gotten so bad. I used to love this app.... Id rather just take notes on my arm"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Downgrade from 5 stars in 2012 to 1 star in 2024. Like other users said, it now limits to only 1 device..it has been adding limitations more and more. The price to upgrade is also expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I liked it a lot. Also because it was free. I will organize my new somewhere else now, since you limited the number of how many times I can unsync a device per month. P.S. it's better running ads inside the app than asking every time if I want to upgrade and hiding the button ;)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app around 2015 because I wanted a simple notes app. This doesn't seem to be what they want anymore. They want their app to be a swiss army knife and they want you to pay for all those features you didn't ask for. I don't know who decided this app needed to a cash cow but they've been squeezing users too much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after using app for 10 yrs wouldn't let me access my notes without paying for account that I don't want. I will be deleting"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"easy way to keep track of everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to be able to use Evernote reliably to connect recipes. Then they started limiting the amount of notes you can have. Then they started limiting the number of devices (which was already a paltry 2). Sure, you can pay for features that you used to have, but I'd rather not. Truly not even worth keeping this app on my phone/laptop, especially when I'm sure it'll eventually go to a complete subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Deleted this and went to Samsung Notes. I deleted my notes down to 35 and still got messages I couldn't add any new notes and that the max was 50. I used to have this synced with my phone, my wife's and desktop. They kept limiting. Now it's only one device. I can't even have the 50 notes promised? You keep taking away features? I was a HUGE proponent of Evernote for years and years. Now i wish I could just give this 0 stars. A huge disappointment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage company, They will relentlessly try to get you to subscribe for an outrageous price!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Used it for a long time. But in the last few months it has changed drastically forcing people to pay to use even the most minimal features. At the end when they didn't allow syncing even on two devices, it was the last nail in the coffin. For me Evernote is an old friend who did me wrong terribly and I can no longer defend this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Раньше это было лучшее приложения для заметок, я пользуюсь им с 2018 года. И все было замечательно, я мог смотреть свои заметки как на компьютере так и на разных телефонах, для меня это было важно потомучто часто менял телефоны. Но теперь без подписки приложением пользоваться невозможно, с разных устройств не зайдешь, потому что лимит. Количество книг и заметок очень сильно ограничено, экран входа и регистрации это вообще ужас. Кароче буду искать другой сервис для заметок. Не советую..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years, and without any warning or notification, I'm being billed. I reached out several times, but there has been no response from anyone. #DON'T USE THEM"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for almost 8 years. It's helped with creating small notes for journaling to full outlines and proposals. I've used the free version and now it's becoming more and more stripped away, they took away my ability to create new notes, leaving me with the ones I've created before the rule, and now they're no longer letting you Un-sync devices more than once a month. These tactics are greedy and show that they have had to trap their customers into eventually just giving in and paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're holding my data hostage. Evernote just keeps throwing the subscription request in my face more and more and now it lets me see my notes for less than a second before popping up again. Stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly nags you to upgrade, unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks for fixing that pop up!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UNETHICAL! I was totally dependent on this app. Now it holds your data ""hostage"" and demands you pay $14.99 a month in order to access your data. BEWARE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am updating this because it has gotten even worse. I used to love this app & have the free version. I hit my limit so I deleted a bunch of my notes but now I can't even view any of my notes in the app. All I get is a pop up telling me to upgrade yet they still say they offer a free version. I don't even take notes with this awful app anymore, I'd just like to view my old ones but I guess they're all lost because I'm not paying for an app that continues to go downhill without a care for clients"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote user since 2011. It was FAR & AWAY the best note taking app for free, so I bought the premium version 2 yrs ago ($8 p/m). I think Evernote was recently bought out, (Bending Spoons?). The app is horrible now. 1. Updates CONSTANTLY now. Sometimes an update requires a restart of the app, sometimes no. Sometimes an update eliminates a feature I was used to, sometimes it just fixes bugs. 2. Premium pricing going to $13 p/m, starting Sept 2024. My solution: OneNote. $70 p/y for premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"BEWARE!! It worked until it didn't. Now it's telling me I've reached my limit and I need to pay for a subscription. I can't see ANY of the notes I have saved until I buy it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage...install at your own risk. App originally came as bloatware, not a chosen app. Apparently they weren't satisfied with what they earned that way. They continually try to squeeze people who didn't ask for their app for money. They said the features on the free version were FREE. Not a ""trial"", but free. Then once you use it they gradually take away functionality while simultaneously bombarding with popups to buy paid version until everything is hostage and you struggle to access notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now the app has lots of annoying ads and restrictions compare to 2 years ago. Each year it got worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very expensive, unreasonable, unethical"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notes are in my apps but they won't open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of pop-ups for you to pay, just make me have will to stop using Evernote. I'll migrate all my notes and never ever use Evernote again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Supports only 1 device not even 2 device when other apps support multiple for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fed up with constant plugs for paid version. Have used you for over 5 years but sadly no really functions as a free app anymore. Constant offers and unable to enter anymore notes. Have moved to an actual free platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier I was loving this app, but it is continuously giving Pop ups for Subscription due to which I am not able to use my old notes which I had recorded earlier...... This is HARRASSMENT"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I can't see my notes in your application now....always asking to purchase Now what is the solution"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The experience is extremely frustrating. After sometime of usage this app keeps popping up the paid version add and forces you to go for the paid version, also it doesn't let you view your current notes. Moreover it also has technical glitches, at a slight tilt it rotates the screen even if rotation is off in your phone. To add up Its difficult to delete notes, this app keeps on bringing them back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rather use a deskpad and pen than this pos. Was great. Now absolute garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over the past few months, they've been rolling back the functionality of the free version of this app. I'll be looking for a replacement soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'd give it zero stars if I could. What kind of garbage note app takes your notes hostage unless you pay out or reactivate some old phone from back when it was free to unconnect from your account?! Not letting me view my old notes without either paying for a month long sub or finding whatever old device is still connected with it is insane."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would give it a negative star if I could. Total trash. Pop ups all the time. Tries to get you to pay for a premium version. Plenty of free apps that do the same if not more. Ignore this garbage. You literally can't use this app for more than 15 seconds without a pop up. Apparently there is a storage limit. Once hit, you can't stop the pop ups to use anything. This is, without a doubt, the worst app I have ever used. I hope they get a really weird and uncomfortable disease that can't be cure"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is not even allowing to see my old not by popping up forceful upgrading ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Then they stayed removing features and bombarding you with ads for the paid version. Now you are no longer allowed to sync across multiple devices which was my main draw. switching to ""google keep""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review 3: Now they're limiting the devices you can access your own info from. That's fine-just annoying - I can access my device from anywhere. Guess it's finally time to transfer to another app. I've been using this app for years and suddenly I'm capped at 1 notebook and 50 notes unless I pay $130? Not gonna happen Evernote. You've just made your app obsolete and you've lost a long-time user. Plenty of other better and free apps out there. Changed rating to 1 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"bugs that never get fixed. I pay for this once great software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frustrated"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My data was not accessible, need to pay heavy subscription to access my data, without prior notice my data was locked.. (Onenote is the best alternative.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version lacks basic features. You can only have 50 notes, 1 notebook, and only sync to 1 additional device. The ""upgraded"" version that costs a WHOPPING $15/month suddenly jumps up to 150,000 notes, 2,000 notebooks, and unlimited synced devices. The company who owns this app is unbelievably greedy. Why not a $2-3/month for 300 notes and 10 notebooks and 5 devices?? WTH is wrong with you people this is a figging NOTE app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's up with this app trying to force people to pay..... This should be an option since it wasn't a requirement to pay from the beginning."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I’m extremely disappointed with Evernote. After limiting my synced devices to one and the number of unsyncs, I’m locked out and forced to pay for access. Constant upgrade prompts and recent feature cuts are frustrating. I’ve used Evernote for over a decade, but now the free version only allows syncing with one device. This change, coupled with high pricing, has driven me to find a better app. Good riddance, Evernote—I’m moving on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just use the web version. Not worth the download"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. I have used the free version for many years, as I'm fine with the limit on number of saved notes, etc. But after the recent update, the app is now useless. If you hit the limit, rather than just being able to delete some old notes, and continue on, they have now added a persistent Subscription screen. It will not allow you to do anything except select a subscription... or exit the app, force close, and come here to warn others about this catastrophic change. Farewell Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Things change, and not always for the better. Used the app for 7+ years to watch firsthand it becoming one of the worst for taking notes I've ever used. Might be hard to find, but I'd wholeheartedly suggest searching for something better rather than even give this a try."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Super restrictive and aggressive ads. Says I have 50 notes available with my free account but getting blocked despite only having 16 notes? In the process of moving my notes out of Evernote so I can delete my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is Extreamly difficult to get a customer service response. I was charged twice, and when I requested a refund, I was asked to log in and log out to upgrade. It amazes me that this is a sophisticated platform that virtually maintains all confidential information. If they can't manage their own platform and understand a very basic aspect of duplicating a charge and mist importantly unable to provide an efficient customer service, do we still trust them? overall market opinion of EN is very low"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is getting too greedy, it keeps trying to make me pay, it's super annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They now only allow use on one device. Literally feels like blackmail to buy their service. I tried a bunch of other ones Zoho Notes and Upnotes are most similar and for $40 you can get a lifetime subscription with Upnotes!! BUG: app deletes more words than you selected if you highlight text and try to erase it on android. Overpriced compared to competitors. Only gave a few days notice before forcing to pay for regular use of the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Llevo un montón de años utilizando esta app. Me obligan a pagar, pago 100€ por tenerla y no va bien, se para, se cierran solas las notas... ES UN TIMOOOO"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can't just take away the ability for us to access the notes we made for years just because you want extra money. Make it read only, give us a time to migrate notes instead of flashing a subscription page on the app. I wish I never used this app, would give 0/5 stars if I could"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App spams for subscription. New limit means only web now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app does not allow to do anything without constantly demanding to pay subscription. All sorts or restrictions and the most annoying constant pop ups in the app. Never again will I use this horrible app. Does not even allow me to copy my notes to be able to save in on another app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It'd not even free anymore I hate this app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stressful app, begin for money, not being able to acces my notes ! Shame on your marketing Evernote! To all users, merge to the Google Notes !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable now. Smh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription about to double in price. Goodbye Evernote . I have been a subscriber for many years. Straight greed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible that they are requiring me to pay in order to access what has been my free notes. I will do so for one month in order to access them and then cancel. Just awful!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why did I have to pay $15 bucks just to retrieve my notes🤦🏽‍♀️ I'm canceling this subscription ASAP. It's been fun Evernote, but I gotta go. Bye👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Switching to Joplin ever since it forced me to pay for premium version. Used to love it, but not anymore..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I downloaded this app as a free app, For simple notes, All my passwords where there. Today i realized that to see my passwords app demands from me to pay before. This is absolutely unacceptable, i got serious problems couse of this unethical move. PLEASE do not download this app, it offers nothing that you don't have in your build in note app in your phones, and definitely you don't need to pay for this primitive service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Had to cancel. I don't feel like the answer to high prices is high prices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version only allows a single device and limits the time you can unsync a device. I could live with the amount of ads I got when I opened the app, but this update made the app essentially useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience, always asks for deals and there is a limit to how many notes u csn create, very bad user experience. Always bombarded with deals which are absurd"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now you just get bombarded with pop ups and doesn't actually let me access my notes anymore because I've reached some sort of made up limit. Was able to copy my notes (between popups) to another note app that doesn't try to rip me off. Do not bother downloading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally never left a review. @evernote corporate why don't you shut this down and we can live in peace. This WAS best note taking app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for years on mobile and laptop but now I get limited access ads and ask me to pay for other devices. Disappointed - I may have to look elsewhere for service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app became almost unusable without a paid subscription. At every interaction a full screen popup comes up and urges you to pay for the subscription and every time it's a one time offer. I will move to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Completely indispensable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Mulai memaksa untuk berlangganan premium, pop up muncul terus menerus😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your scheme of forcing people to pay money before doing virtually anything is terrible. I can't access any of my notes. Over the last 3 years I've used this app to record a lot in my life and I can't access them without a subscription? I wish I had a means of stopping people from downloading this app because it is a scam at this point"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since the very beginning. Neither a paying user nor a power user. I just have a few notes with password hints. Nobody would pay for simple note taker. This is the reality. Looks like the latest version took the useability for free user to the new low. It begin to limit usage via browser. It wont let me in tonight as I have accessed Evernote via more than 2 different browsers this month. Figured out how to move my notes to Google Doc. This is it. Won't be back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Best one before ,now payed one .all my notes are stuck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is getting increasingly buggy the pressure to upgrade to a payed plan is way too aggressive. I have been using it for many years but I am done, I'll try Notion. Sorry, but I am not paying for incompetence."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote app not working on android...it's quite disappointing...The software makers have held us for ransom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Let's you put notes in then blocks you from getting to them unless you pay, SCAM"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and never had any problems, until i was forced to pay to view my notes. Never been so disappointed in an app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using it for years and now it's useless to me as a college student"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Realy 1 sync devive?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too expensive and removed security code to open app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version only lets you sync one device now?? Not really much of a sync if it's just your phone to their server... I guess it's a backup service. Though at this rate, they'll probably ask me to pay $100 to restore my data if I ever switch devices. Used to love Evernote, now I'm probably leaving for good 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for probably 10 years as a free account. Extremely disappointed of no notification that the change was to happen. I have had it on 2 devices since the beginning as a backup if the first one crashed. Now I can't even access the information to get it off without paying. Have very important information on there. Probably going to have to pay just to get my stuff off. Then it will be goodbye. I had recommended this app to so many people over the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be an ok apps, but recent upgrade is just borderlining annoying, can't do this can't do that.. Here's an idea, you are just a note saving apps, why not charge at a cheaper price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Was using the free version but now they hijacked my notes and I had to sign up for a monthly plan just to get access. I'm moving my notes and now need to figure out how not to get charged again 🤬"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After loading notes for 10 years on the free version, I can't access my notes in this app any more. Breach of trust. Go else where for your phone notes. Not happy at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With every single update Evernote seeks to nickel and dime its userbase. Every single feature is slowly being locked behind a paywall until it is no longer feasible to use this app without an exorbitant fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant even use the app and read my old notes! Ok I dont want to create another note, but stop with this ""Limit reached"" spam message. Wow worst app ever! I will never pay only because of this endless popup!!! Just download Keep Notes from google. Same thing just way better and free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think there has been a new update but for the last 2 days evernote has been unusable. There is constant annual sign up pop up. It use to only do it when I first went in but now I'm not even able to select a note im trying to access because of this pop up. I've tried forse stop and tried to uninstall and re installing it and loging in. It still hasn't stopped it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app in its kind"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Signed out of all devices unless I pay, shocking service Update: the app continues to get slower & buggier, almost unbearable Every day it pushes me to pay for a subscription with a 'one time' offer, editing notes is full of friction, it's now a slow app & often creates conflicts with notes when you have patchy signal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to pay and get 40% off promotion but Ii doesn't work. Few years back that app was without any problem. Now it's not the same"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for over a decade!! It has been great UNTIL the last couple weeks! Now it won't let me open up & see ANY of my notes unless I pay. I only use this for simple notes & lists. I am having to disconnect Evernote from my phone (on app) so that I can get access logging into website. Now I will just copy & paste everything somewhere else because I am afraid I will loose everything! Sad!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"0 stars because they continue to delete function for the free version. I have been using this app for years and slowly watched it increase the paywall. And now they've embedded AI to track all your notes. I already didn't like storing notes in a 3rd party system. Especially one that tracks the notes specifically for AI. 0 stars for absurdly high pricing even if I wanted to pay for it... 2 star because UI is great. Going to dump it soon and find a different one. Byeeeee"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"useful but expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the free version for years but refuse to pay for it when there's other free notes apps. Now I'm locked out from even viewing some very important docs without ANY notice. Money hungry and beyond unprofessional!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent note taking app. Very good handwriting recognition, and a host of useful features. Highly recommended."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't let me get my notes back. It just tells me that I ran out of space and to pay 14$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited amount of notes unless you pay for a monthly subscription and keeps asking you to upgrade every 5 seconds. UPDATE: I hate Evernote now!!! They now just blocked me out of my account unless I pay. I'm going to pay for one month to safe all my notes because I have no other choice and then I'm gone forever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow, thanks to the last update Evernote is holding me hostage saying I have reached my note limit and the stupid subscription pop-up won't allow me to go back and see my existing notes. Thanks a lot. I will never pay you for a subscription to this mediocre product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app they force you to upgrade to the paid version now, I've been using the free version for years, oh well I guess it's time to move on to another note app, cause Evernote is very lame and greedy now, I would not recommend this app to anyone now😡😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing out free users -- I used Evernote for free for years and loved it but in the last year they have made changes to cut off free users, limiting or ending even the most basic and standard features. Terrible treatment of users and what used to be a staple organizational app for me has become a nightmare in user experience. Such a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app became trash!!.. Sooo slow. Sometimes it doesn't open at all.. Plus, it always show annoying discount ads.. It's time to use native Notes app instead of this bandwidth consuming thing! Shame on you.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been a free user for many years, and I'm sad I can't access my notes anymore. I try, but an ad for purchasing keeps popping up before I can open it. I understand you want subscription $ now, best of luck. I will need to find another notes app. 😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If i could give it less then 1 star i would, the quality of this app is just getting worse and worse with them trying to corral as many users as possible onto a payed plan. I have used this app for a good few years now and it has gotten to the poin when i can't do anything without a pop up asking me to upgrade apearing. I am also wildly unhappy with the removal of free features recently, this does not make me want to pay for evernote, it just pisses me off. I'll be deleting this app immediatly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has turned to utter garbage. No longer syncs reliably to my Android phone. I renew at the end of the month and now have to find a new home for 17,000 notes I use for my writing and hobbies so I can cancel before I pay these clowns another £80."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye annoying app!!! Get other option not this one! There are other apps that can do better than what it can!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"can't cut and paste within a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I would use it for school and recipes. I am done with school so I mainly use it for recipes. Everytime I use the app it trys to make me join a subscription. I don't see the value of paying for a subscription when I barely use it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This company started with free notes for 2 devices and now limited for 1 which pushing people to expensive costs . I am not interested in unlimited which cost nearly 10 per month! Really greedy company. Do not start saving your notes for free if you want to be surprised later! not recommended!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Echoing what many others have written already and saying the same thing. Overall a good app, but after having used it for years and accommodating to the two device limit, this recent ""upgrade"" having taken that away (one of the few remaining features of the free version) is the last straw for me. If I can't sync notes between a second device and the primary one, then I have no use for this app. It's a shame, because on top of that, the cheapest subscription is exhorbitant! Thanks for ruining it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lots of other apps available that are great and free. This one isn't free anymore!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very bad. That is you have pay to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app a but with each passing day, this app is becoming a nightmare. First you had two devices on which you could login, now these geniuses allow only web app to sign in and deliberately count it as a new device forcing you to logout of other devices. Apart from all this you get only one chance a month to unsync a device making me not even able to login on any device. What a Baloney !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: even worse as of 08/24: limited to one device with more aggressive upgrade popups. Hard to transfer data out. AWFUL. Used to be good but they're obviously failing now as they've limited features and the upgrade popups happen multiple times a day which absolutely ruin the experience. The app itself is buggy and I have to reopen it frequently as it doesn't work, so there's zero chance I'll upgrade. I'm looking for a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience, the worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but now it is really awful to use. It keeps asking me to subscribe to the paid plans. It is really annoying that it pops up almost every sec I am on the app. And now I can't even access the notes as it keeps asking me to pay for the subscription. Goodbye Evernote. You are really terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Became very annoying Keeps showing popups to buy different plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I had a subscription for a couple of years. I didn't see a value in it, so I'm using a free plan. But it looks like every month I open it, they cut the free version more and more. Now, it is impossible to sync even two devices... a few months ago, it had a limit of 3. I don't recommend this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not even worth a single star. Used to be my go to app for making notes, but now it seems they are only interested in minting money. Can't access my notes so that atleast I can transfer or copy them somewhere else or delete some notes in order to stay in the limit. These people are only interested in pushing their premium versions down the throat of their customers. Pathetic! Have some brains....... Google keep notes for the win."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be a brilliant app. Since the last update, it's far less user friendly. It's clunky and slow, especiallyin the search option. The text size has changed and I can't for the life of me get it back to normal. Not happy at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Tasks in android are malfunctioning,some high priority and flagged tasks are not showing after filter is reset all ,recurring filter also not working as well many a times,samecwith priority filters."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EDIT: previously had given 5 stars, revised to 1 star. Since new ownership or whatever, they've essentially hijacked most, if not, all of my info from a previous free plan until I've decided to pick a paid plan. NO THANK YOU! No warning about highjacking people's info before new ownership."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""I've been a loyal Evernote user for years, but recently, the app has become utterly useless. Every time I try to open my notes, I'm bombarded with a pop-up message demanding I upgrade to premium. No matter how many times I dismiss it, the message persists, making it impossible to access my notes. It's like being held hostage for a upgrade I don't need. The constant harassment has rendered the app unusable. I'm extremely disappointed in Evernote's aggressive upselling tactics"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just get you in with free and then start taking away free options and charging you to use what was always free. Plenty of better apps than this one that are more trustworthy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great I cannot access my notes because every damn thing wants their own individual subscription now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be good many years ago. Now unusable. Excessive advertisements and egregious abuse of pop-ups to get you to subscribe monthly for a glorified notepad. I will be moving all of my notes to another app so I won't have to deal with this one anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid at all cost. They recently added an expensive monthly subscription for keeping my notes. After keeping my notes hostage I uninstalled and used apple notes and samsung notes instead, much safer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sucky app..now I can't even open my notes, at least give us time if u want to rid ur free users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like so many others, I've enjoyed this app for years. Now they've gotten greedy and the app says I've reached my limit. (If it's a size or number of notes limit I have definitely not). As a total dick move the popups prevent me from copying my notes to move to a new app. I hope your avarice destroys your user base."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app currently on my device,won't be much longer once I transfer everything over. It was great for years now I can't even access my notes without being locked out until pony up $15 for short term access to notes I've had on here for 7 or 8 years on the free version. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Look for some other app everyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app at one time. Not so much anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. I'm switching back to One Note. You've limited the free version from 2 devices down to 1. and constantly ask to upgrade like almost every time. I understand you have to make money but I don't like your strategy. Thanks for letting me try out your app tho."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Killed by Commercialisation. I've used Evernote for years and it's been good. I haven't minded the ads too much as I'm using it for free so hey ho. Part of the package I guess. They recently made syncing across devices a paid feature and Evernote is not cheap. I absolutely hate this as it reeks of mindless money grabbing. Syncing across devices carries no cost to them as an organisation so it's merely a tactic to frustrate you into paying . I've migrated everything into my Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 1 device for free is scandalous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote. Free version impossible to use, bugged orientation that doesn't lock itself."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gotten increasingly worse (free version) until I must now leave. I used to be able to use it on multiple devices, then it changed to only 2. Now suddenly, only one device. If I can get my notes out of Evernote, I'll be deleting it today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now is just a never ending and wildly annoying push for subscription. Moving to a better note app. Don't bother with Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years and now I can't even look at my notes without subscribing? What the heck"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update. On s24 the keyboard in Evernote keeps on closing. Nearly impossible to add or edit notes now. Though works fine on win11. I use the personal paid version. Started using for about a month. Great app. Would love a 'remove' checked items from inside a note. Very nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. They allow you to start up and then force you to pay. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2017. The paywall is insane - I couldn't even log in to delete my account without the app locking me out because of the exceeded number of access points/devices, because it counted the window it opened as a second device. Thankfully, I didn't have that much left to take off the app since the update when the note/notebook number was limited. So long, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"(Adding August, 2024... Done with this app. These clowns disabled having a second device and STILL buggy as hell. Switching to Keep or Onenote. Wouldn't be surprised if bending spoons goes out of business) Buggy, can't disable auto rotate. Spams limited time offers (that are ALWAYS available) for paid version ever day I open it. Limits number of notes AND books now. Zero reason to keep using this. Bending Spoons ruined this app... Hope your investors bail on you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute TRASH!! This app used to be so good and so useful, but now I can't even see the notes I have due to the constant, and I mean CONSTANT, push to buy the subscription. I've used Evernote for YEARS. I was mad when it started acting up, not letting me type or delete text without problems, but now I can't even see what I have because it pushes for you to buy VERY LITERALLY every second. I am FIGHTING against the ad just to highlight my text so I can copy it all and take it elsewhere. NOPE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you don't already have it, don't bother trying it unless you think a simple note taking app is worth $77 per year. Find something else! They keep trying to force existing users to subscribe to a paid version ($77 year for a note taking app is absurd!) by limiting the amount of notes. I'm to the point of wanting to copy the notes I have out of it and delete my account, but the stupid popup ad saying I've reached my limit won't collapse, so I can't even look at the notes I already have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No longer enjoying this. Had it for years..Keeps sending me notices to pay and unsync a device. It's only 2 connected. Before it was more, then it's down to 2. Now it's telling me to have only 1 now. Anyone know of any other Apps to keep notes like this? Not cool Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"🖕 this app and its developers! I uploaded the free version years ago. Now, you greedy aholes made it impossible to open and access my important files in attempting to extort me to buy your paid version. It is a Mob move, and you should not upload or put anything of importance on the Free version. Just find a better app that doesn't strongarm you to access your own creativity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years but suddenly it log me out, I tried to log back in multiple times but everytime it just lead me to the beginning where we need to write our email to log in. Again and again. Please fix this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for almost a decade. Was once a great free notebook app, now more and more features are moved behind a paywall. Now I can't even create new notes anymore because they introduced a 50 notes limit. Infuriating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After happily enjoying this app for years, they're suddenly springing a $15 monthly charge on me. I'm outa here!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage application. It's worth less than 1 star"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"was a great note app, then they locked me out of all my notes and strong armed me to pay to get them back.Very disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over 10 years and was very happy with it. Now, the check box function is pretty much useless. Many times, it changes my check boxes to bullet points, which don't do me any good for checking off items on a list. Update. - I'm done with this app completely. I was perfectly happy with the free version and didn't mind the adds. Now they have restricted the use of it so much it's worthless. $130 a year for a simple note-taking app is INSANE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access my notes anymore. Yes, I get it, I don't have a premium plan, and can't create new notes. But for God's sake let me access and see my old notes. And now all of a sudden I can't open my notes on two devices. Great. I'll have to switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this app free version for many years it is now subscription only. I kept selecting the continue with free version then yesterday that did not work I had to choose a plan to view my notes. I will be dropping this after the month I paid for is over. You've had a free version this long, there is no reason you cannot continue to have one. There are many people who will pay for your billed versions for the options they use this for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome improvent. The simplicity of the home update allows me to use the app often. Flawless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, buggy and won't let me upload a profile picture.Really annoying me now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for 20 years. But the company got greedy to a degree that I cannot see my old notes anymore because of the money demands, upgeade notifications etc. This is definitely the worst application EVER. The name should be EVERSUCKS.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years in its most basic function. I've never used the extra features, only the notepad because that's all I needed. The various constant pop-ups have been annoying, but it is what it is. Now, I can not seem to access my notes without paying. I don't recall seeing any warning that this was coming. I'm rather furious. I understand having a paid app, but give users a warning so we no what to expect. Now, I'll have to pay to retrieve my notes. Unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used the free version for years because it was simple enough and I could use it in my computer and phone. For quite some time now, before I can even see a note, I have to dismiss endless notifications to upgrade and the ""X"" symbol to close them is not even visible. The app has become virtually useless for quick notes now that it takes so much time to open them. the cherry on top is that now they forced me to unlink one device, so I can only use one device with the free version. Terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously the free plan was good able to sync 2 devices which is reasonable. Now only limit to 1 device which is so inconvenience and always pop out the plan for you to pay and sign up. So disappointing. Such a stingy company. And no new note can be added because free plan has notes limit... NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New Design without Homepage is frustrating for me. To search what you ve done last among thousands of notebooks and notes is user-unfriendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great but now it won't let me open my notes without forking out money. Very unhappy. Do not download!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Edited: As of August 2024, this app no longer allows more than one device for the free version. This is not a problem for me as I really only use it on my phone. I had to unsync a second device that I wasn't using anyway to be allowed to access my notes. Be aware of this change. ----------- I've been using Evernote for over a year and still love it! It keeps me organized no matter where I am or what I'm doing. No more lists floating around on scraps of paper. Everything goes in Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've had since Aug 2013 thank for longevity and continuing to get better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am disgusted with this app. I have used it since the beginning. I have so much important information on this app including birthdays, family recipes, and many other important notes. Now these Nazis are demanding Ransom and not allowing me to get back in. Now my family, friends and I will be scouring the internet for anything ""Bending Spoons"" is affiliated with and boycotting them for life. Maybe you should pay attention to all the one-star ratings! I hope ""Bending Spoons"" loses everything!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a very old user of this app using it from long time. Today it is giving me additional login warning and I am unsyncing it but it keeps getting crashed Nd closing the app automatically.. Can not use it anymore.. How to retrieve current notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The bloated laggy interface is now intolerable to use. Simply opening a note involves navigating a maze of menu layers and closing repeated intrusive popup ads for an exorbitant subscription version, after many basic free features have been paywalled. When syncing between devices was revoked with no warning, it rendered this tool I depend on daily pointless and I had to rush to export my notes to Obsidian. Punitive and extortionate advertising tactics have the opposite effect on the consumer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The App is forcing me to subscribe but all I want to do is access a few notes stored on the app. That's just plain naughty. If I reached a 'limit' then the app should stop me from adding new content. It shouldn't extort a subscription by holding my data to ransom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It works good. Seeing a white screen after the biometrics/pin option and unable to get rid of it. stop pushing paid option like crazy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now cannot log in... 🤪🤪🤪... Always ask for log... No choice for user whether want it or not"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ways how they push users to payed subscriptions is unacceptable! Nice move to use racketeering tactics against your loyal users and take their notes as hostages. Good thing there is the ways to export notes to other applications..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow, I hadn't opened this in a while and it is useless now. It was annoying before, as they limited how many synced devices one could use, but it's 1 now? That renders it literally pointless. If I'm only using one device, I can just keep notes on that. If it were even the web and a phone, it would have some use, but you can't even do that. Had to get greedy and ruin it. Now everyone will abandon it, like I am now. Uninstalling from everything. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app only on my phone for over 15 years. Used it for travel info. Retired now and don't travel much and only used it occasionally. Now it won't let me in to see the notes I saved. Wants 15 dollars a month, all I want is my notes back, but I refuse to give them money and no one to contact. DON'T get sucked in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You just kept killing free functions until it's not worth keeping. Only one device sync renders the app useless, and what I need is not worth 13 euros/month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was almighty at one point; simple to use and I could sync across multiple platforms. Unfortunately the app seems to have been involved in some kind of merger/buyout and now is full of prompts to pay exorbitant amounts of money to upgrade to a premium plan (more than doubled since the merger). Ultimately I have decided to shop around for a replacement and have now realised that not only is the app pricey and full of adverts, it's also outdated. Goodbye Evernote, hello Joplin."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There's other apps that provide for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing to buy the paid version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible changes and holding notes hostage! BYE, FELICIA! Switched to MS OneNote. WAY BETTER!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Functionally unusable without paying for a subscription. They have stripped away functionality that used to be free like notebooks, tagging, and now even using multiple devices logged on at the same time and put them all behind the paywall. There are constant pop-ups that interrupt basic usage and advertise the paid version. The additional functions in the subscription may make it a step above other note apps in terms of variety of options but it is absolutely not worth using the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They shifted away from the original philosophy of the app that made me fall in love with it. The original app was a fast and aesthetically appealing system for capturing my thoughts, images, recordings and stacking them in a notebook. They are now a calendar-based/task list software. This reordering of priorities may be great for some users who want an alternative to Microsoft Outlook on their phones but is far from the Swiss army knife of a notetaking app that I grew to love."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once the memory limit is reached, you can't access your notes anymore because of the annoying pop-up that wants to sell you an upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has gotten so bad. I've been using it for over 10 years and just undownloaded it (after copying over over 200 notes manually to another service). Way too expensive, does not feel user friendly anymore. They dug their own grave."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app, but recently it told me that I had too many notes and I had to upgrade. The problem is, it's not letting me into my notes so that I can delete some of them. Basically, you are holding my notes ransom! I don't need it enough to pay for it, but I should at least be able to access what I was able create previously. Please contact me so I can get this fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You used to be cool, but now you’re just a (useless) tool… What a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand that apps need to make money but I just can't bring myself to pay $80 a year for a notebook! I use this app for 6 years and I slowly lost access to all the features that used to be free, every time Evernote has a ""required"" update. One of the features that I have liked is that I could transfer notes from my phone to my computer but now I'm only allowed to sync one device on the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good riddance Evernote! I've used this app since May 22, 2011, and recommended others do so as well. But I'm done as of today. The limits on syncing data across devices, and ridiculous pricing tiers for the tiny amount of data that my text files consume. I've officially removed my hundreds of text files and moved on to a better app. Stay away from this over priced app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 Device Only = 👎🏻. Disappointed. I've used this since 2014."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote would be voted #1 most wanted app company to jump off a cliff. Try multiple pop up ads blocking you every time you open the app asking you to pay up, device limited to 1, notes limited, no free note export. Reminder: this was completely free and unlimited before AND there are still note apps that offer their service (the same service as Evernote) free of charge. Evernote burn in the land down under. I can't even get my old notes out you fks. Worst app downfall in history."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"05.02.21 I've been using this app for years now, on my phone, my laptop and the web clipper and recently I've been getting pop ups telling me that to continue in this vein I now have to pay or unsync one of my 'devices'. 11.08.24 ok, well they are actively chasing customers away now. Reducing the service down to just one device does not persuade us to pay for what we have previously had for free. Research time for me for an alternative now. Just give up now Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I USED to love this app & recommended it to every1. 1st, it takes away the ability to create new notes & notebooks - & now 2nd device sync! & only 2 sync switches a month? WTH?! I've used this for 13+ years to jot down ideas on the go & retrieve them on my laptop later. Being able to sync a 2nd device for free was the one thing that kept me. For a low-income university student, your monthly fees aren't affordable enough. I'll uninstall as soon as I download/move all my notes & find a better app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version became totally unusable after my latest update (Aug-10-2024). Uninstall & reinstall didn't help. What's going on? Can't even pack my old notes and move elsewhere! An early warning about deadline for discontinuing the free version would have been very useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They closed my free account with my personal information"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I enjoyed this app for probably a decade now. Shame that it fell so low."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote got me down to one device... Its been fun. Bad PR move on your part. This used to be a 4.5+ star app. Now you're down to 3.5, pay attention Evernote. Who's ever idea this was in your company failed you lol. Been using this app since 2017... Smh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is not my ever note anymore. Since the new owner there have been toooo many restrictions on the free option. One device does not constitute syncing in this day and age. You have made it very easy for competitors to steal potential customers Bending Spoons! Will be moving to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it's a decent note platform. if you want to share then you need to pay for a fairly high subscription plan. it doesn't support all my devices. it doesn't handle check boxes as well as it used to. it feels like they don't think they are important. they like to add more features than support or bug fixes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can no longer ""sync between devices "" unless you pay 14.99/month. Pointless, almost got locked out of alot of things, have used for years, but that's just petty."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, then they made it so you have to pay a yearly plan to do almost anything that you would expect from the app. As well as forcibly spamming you with the option to pay, if you try to get rid of the pop up, it brings ups more windows to ask, 'are you sure?' and all of these pop ups and Windows lag the phone and the application considerably. I do not recommend this app and you should avoid it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First giving free usage, then forcing you to pay to reach the notes you wrote before. That is ridiculous!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could do less than 1 star I would. I have had this app for years and collected notes that I use. I haven't added new notes in several years because of the pay model. Now my old notes are locked behind a paywall with absolutely NO NOTICE from Evernote. This is wrong as they should have given notice so I could have at least copied them to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime is worse. They force you to get a monthly or annual plan. Otherwise, it has become extremely limited. It was my favorite app, do yourself a favor and don't get this unnecessary sht."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2015, and I really loved it. It was one of my most used apps. I believe I will need to find a new app, however. It says I've reached my limit for synced devices, but I have only my phone and the browser version linked. I can't currently use the browser version because it says there is an issue. This is ridiculous. I understand a company needing to make money to continue to run, but the prices are ridiculous, and there is no lifetime subscription option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So horrible with pushing there paid plans that you often can't exit there adds to get to your saved content. Horrible experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless now as a free non payer user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent limitations make this app useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Apparently I cannot unsynch the devices more than twice a month. What horrible move to push the subscription. I cannot use two devices in parallel. I'm moving away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best app, until they started demanding money to use something as simple and taking notes 🫥"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote abandoned users of the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm UNINSTALLING this app. I've used it for YEARS, but the recent changes have been UNACCEPTABLE and INTOLERABLE. First you put a limit to notes (which bothered me but I didn't mind). Then, you put a limit to synced devices...which now is ONE?!? What is there to sync IF I'M ONLY ALLOWED TO USE ONE DEVICE? These changes are ridiculous and NO, I won't subscribe. I'm sick of subscriptions this and subscriptions that. You just lost a (then) loyal user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had rated this app at 5 star when I started using it 6 years ago. In the last year is has become the worst not taking app and they have lost my business. Not to mention you can only have 1 synched device now. What a joke. Goodbye Evernote. There are plenty of other companies that will be happy to have my business. Go back to what you once were and I'll probably return."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"please add handwriting pen like samsung notes...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, but I am very close to downloading all my notes and deleting it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You are ordinary rascals and thieves, you scoundrel's! You blocked my access to my notes and won't let me transfer or delete them without paying you! It is vile and senseless abuse!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would have given this app 5✳️'s prior to upgrading to a paid subscription. Ever since I downgraded it is almost impossible to access my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've switched to a different notes app. I suggest you stay away from this one. I've had this for 8 years, and it used to be good, but greedy people always find a way to ruin good things. Lately, every time you open the app, you get bombarded by ads urging you to upgrade to premium. Over the years, these ads have become more frequent. And if that would be the only problem, I might be willing to look past it. But it also seems like they're locking more and more features behind the paywall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good app gone down the drain. Didn't need to upgrade because I only used it on one device. Recently, I can't use it at all because it's requiring an upgrade. Unusable. Also, the upgrades are not the most affordable. Limiting devices is one thing and acceptable, but at this point you should just make it a paid app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"cannot use for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"increasing price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was happy with free version. Now saying I've reached my limit & won't even let me look at my notes without upgrading. Not worth it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't access my note unless you pay for it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had Evernote for so many years and I have had so much use for the app. But now it's getting worse. Have the free version and now I can use one device. Used to be at least two. And Evernote should be green, not blue. Change the ""check boxes""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The neverending number of prompts to subscribe makes the app totally unusable. Several better note book apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me see my notes until I pay!? Full of spam now, and they also broke search now. I have been using evernote for years, entrusting it with all my data, on all my devices. They soiled this trust by now only allowing two devices since Nov 2016. I will never consider paying them a penny after this monstrous update which removes functionality rather than adding some."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very dishonest company. They got me to join with promises of free functionality and all I really needed was just simple text notes. Then they started to cut down functionality. Now it's really ridiculous... Almost impossible to use with mobile devices ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The same as other recent reviews have said; This was once a free and useful app that worked better than its competitors, such as Google notes. I didn't like the going to a subscription based model but understood it, and the free option was fair, in my opinion. But then it started to drastically limit notes and devices. Fine, I was out of college now anyways and adapted to the restrictions. Now I open up my phone and see you can only have ONE device?! That's ridiculous. Reeks of investors."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote for 10 years. Loved it. I used it for everything. Notes are deleting themselves randomly after saving and sometimes even while writing one. Lost lots of stuff. Why not just go back to what worked before? Why keep updating to make it worse??? Now the free account is limited to one notebook and 50 notes! And you can only have one synced device on a free plan when it used to be two. Bye. Avoid at all costs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years, despite the constant, daily, money begging pop-ups. And now after the last update, you can't even acces your notes from 2 different devices without paying, which is crazy!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version was wonderful but now they are charging and no more free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2012, and last year, I couldn't access it as it just keeps crashing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used the platform for about 10 years ... but, unfortunately, this wave of subscriptions also reaches them. It is normal to ask for some money for a product, but luckily for we (the users) have other options, even for free. From my point of view, by comparison, at this moment (August 2024) and because it was limited to 1 device (when there were 2 devices - it was acceptable, I was managing, I wasn't giving up) from which the platform can be used (for free). .. I will choose ONENote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Find better way to monetize your app kr just kill it already. This was the best app in this category but you gradually ruined it completely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be 5 stars but now... It used to be my goto thing for all my ideas etc. For a few years now, the Android App has become laggy, and slow. The editing tools are hidden under layers. For a week now, I am unable to connect more than a single device on Free version. Unable to create new notes as new restrictions have been placed. I wanna pay, but the prices are unjustifiably high. Would they make the Android App better in coming weeks or months if I pay? Not sure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have totally restricted the free version now so you can't even look at an old note for a few seconds without a pop-up appearing to totally restrict your view. It is obvious they only want paid subscribers now but their aggressive way of doing this is out of proportion for a notes app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just don't install this app. I've been using it for years, now I only see the screen to pay for a subscription. There's not even an option to copy your data to transfer it to another location. Pay - then we'll open it. It's just rudeness on the part of the developers. I can imagine how many people have suffered."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good until they make you pay for it. Ridiculous pricing now I have to subscribe just to access my stuff and remove it from the service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible! Stop pushing me to use the paid version every single 1 second!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app stalls out and doesn't allow for any input to happen. The app just closes out. I sent them an email. We'll see what they say."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app free for 10+ years, and it used to be my most important app. Now under new ownership it's practically worthless. Nonstop advertising for a 40% off deal that ""ends soon"" (I get the offer every time i access the app now) and even with the deal it's far more expensive than it used to be. Then they started limiting the total number of notes, and now you can only have 1 device. Not worth it, get Google Docs instead. I'm stuck now but I'd leave if I could. Utter disaster."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and have hundreds of notes on it. Now I am being forced to upgrade to access my data. Unbelievable, will be changing to another note provider. Very disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscribed monthly. However it doesn't get activated. Customer support is not responsive and helpful despite providing all the necessary details."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for over 13 years now for the basic functionality of syncing, predominately text-only notes between devices and accessing between phones/PC. But over the last few years the Free-user functionality has reduced it to effectively nothing---including a *single* device limit that locks me out of accessing phone notes on Desktop. Combined with a high monthly subscription fee not being worth it for mere text notes, I have no reason to use nor endorse the app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for several years but recently became terrible as the developer is forcing users to upgrade by removing crucial features. I wish I can move all my notes to another app easily. I wish I could give it a zero star. I haven't uninstalled yet because of my existing notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way to alienate customers with your changes. Pathetic."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In the past, it was the best app! But, now, it is the worst!! I'm gonna leave it forever!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is very useful, but there is an issue when using it in Urdu. The checklist and bullet points are only aligned to the left side, and there is no option to move them to the right side. When writing in Urdu, it's important to align the text to the right; otherwise, it becomes difficult to read and write. I request that this issue be resolved to improve the experience for Urdu users. This change would greatly enhance the usability of the app and make it more accessible for users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I feel very sad. It is a good application, but its problem is the subscription fee. Every second it appears to you, it is very annoying. If you have alternative solutions, use them"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. Used to love this app but it is now expensive, unreliable, and buggy. Jumping ship asap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From 2 device limit to 1. It's going to be fully premium app, as free version has become unworkable. And the premium version is also too expensive. Even newspaper, journals doesn't cost that much in India."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So the free version allows you to sync with 1 device. Where's the ""sync"" in that? Why not make an entry-level or casual user plan/ teir that's affordable to us smaller users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth it for the free app. Used to be able to sync 2 devices for free. Now down to one. When I signed up for a free trial, app was so glitchy and wouldn't let me use the app and wanted to sign me up for a paid app even though I had the free trial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"features slowly taken away. I have been using this app for over 10 years and they slowly take more and more of the free features away and charge an outrageous price for what the app is. I literally use this so to only have 1 note. that's it, I share this app with two devices, now I can't. this is not worth 15 dollars a month. not at all. maybe they dropped it down to 2.00 dollars would it be worth it. but not to share 1 note on two phones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. However it's become literally unusable. I cannot use this without paying for a subscription now. I will be transferring my notes and uninstalling this app 😕 Not by choice but because it literally tells me I can't use it without a monthly subscription now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to move on from Evernote! Been using this app for years and really hated its attitude towards charging. All for paying for the service but wrong way to do it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app ..but now it's the Worst Note app ever. Even though I've used the free version for several years with no issue and have many notes, every single time I go on now, it's a nightmare! Money-Hungry app developers! Will delete soon after I copy everything over to Microsoft OneNote and other apps. ** All of this would be different if they gave you a chance to at least look at one of your notes you've had for 8 years....Goodbye Evernote!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"logged me out while travelling. lost document i made ready for the airport"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is done. They've been trying hard to get rid of their users or force them into their subscription schemes. It's their product and their right to manage it as they see fit. But given that there are many competitive replacements out there, it makes little sense to me. You can only keep 1 device synced on the free subscriptionl. This could've been done for new sign-ups only, but the old users were also targeted (my first review of this app was in 2014!)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enshitification, congrats on trashing your reputation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the latest, 1 device sync for the free plan, it is a joke. It is a useless tool now, might as well just use notepad. Plus it is getting slower and slower with each update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One device now with a limited number of notes. Trying out alternatives now. Google Keep is working fine at the moment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No worry. You are driving out free users even we have been with you you for decade. You already stop allowing new notes. Now you only allow single device access. So, bye and I'll switch to others. Good for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This gets ZERO stars. Don't bother with this app... used to be great, but now you're limited to 1 device. RIDICULOUS!!! They are constantly soliciting you to buy their upgrades. You can easily do better with other apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I originally gave this a 5 star rating. Along with other recent reviewers, I've used this app for years then was informed that I could no longer make new notes without a subscription. Then was informed I had to unsync devices unless I upgraded to a subscription. Now, I can not access my notes at all. You have a great product. A better, less obviously greedy path would be to offer a tiered platform. A free basic to pull people in, then offer app add-ons & subscription plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Раньше в этом приложении годами хранил заметки и мигрировал от устройства к устройству, сейчас же невозможно даже почитать что есть в заметках без навязчивых всплывающих окон с предложением купить. Угробили годное приложение."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without making payment, you lost your saved data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dear Evernote, it's no longer""syncing"" when it's just on one device. Too many issues using Evernote. Too many updates Too many upgrade ads. Write a new note - upgrade Open the app - upgrade Decline the option to upgrade - you get another pop up asking ""are you sure?"" Evernotes has more ads than Po(r)n websites. TrashApp Bye!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my go-to notes app for over 5 years. I have journals from me in highschool on this. The last 2 years they have seriously downgraded the user quality. Every time I logged on, I had to go through ads from premium membership. Finally they reduced synced devices and limited free note pages. I'm finally gonna organize all the pages I have and make the switch over to Notion or some other note taking app. What a bummer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got a little money hungry, huh?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be good but they have made it unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be an awesome tool for personal and / or business purposes. Now they send you pop-up messages continously and reduce the capacity of storage if you don't pay 15 bucks a month. I will export my information to a new app and get rid of this trash. Bye bye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trap app, used to be good now just money hungry app. Don't recommend anyone to use this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I heard about this app years ago, and I fell in love with it. I got a lot of functionality for free, and I appreciated it. Then, one day, the nagging messages started. Apparently, someone thought the best way to get people to pay exorbitant monthly fees was to nag them until they signed up. I considered leaving then, but I held on. Now you've reduced the number of devices to 1 only? I'd be willing to pay if the amount was reasonable. Or, if you didn't nag me all the time. But this? I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for years, and now, with the latest update, they limit you to one device or pay for unlimited devices. I was able to work with two devices but now this is all but useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app wants money now so dint get it, more free better apps tell owner of site screw self. I changed all my passwords because of thier fraudulent attempt to access and give my personal account numbers out..lawsuit coming thier way..forewarning to all that try use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be able to sync my phone to my laptop - no more. I was fine putting up with the constant nagging messages and ads asking to upgrade, but now sadly you can only have 1 device with no linking. There is basically no reason to have this app now, I will be moving to Microsoft OneNote soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHAT HAPPENED?!?! I didn't use it daily but I did use it. I used the free version and now....? I can't access any of my notes. It looks like they're all gone. And there was some important stuff in there. Is there no longer a free version? If not how can I access old notebooks/notes to get what I need? There have been several updates recently that I haven't really liked but it was fine for what I used it for. I need help to get access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Junk since latest update. I deleted my account because you can now only sync with 1 app unless you pay. That should apply to ""new"" users only IMO. Plenty of other free services out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The push to get users to upgrade to premium has become more aggressive, with constant 'today only' discount offers for the past couple of years. Now, they've limited usage to a single device, restricted the ability to create new notes, and falsely claim you can keep up to 50 notes or less. This app is clearly on a decline, making it a good time to start migrating to another platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since 2010. I remember when the device limit for the free plan was capped at two, then notes were capped to 50, and now you can only use a single device. What's the point anymore? Evernote isn't putting users first and its cash grabs are shameless. Offering upgrades through incessant pop-ups is one thing, but continually downgrading features from long-time users is just loathsome. There are plenty of alternatives out there now. Avoid Evernote at all costs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app gets worse the more it is updated. Old links and media that I've saved to notes no longer work with no explanation. Regretting making this the place I save my recipes. Many things lost to time, which is literally the opposite of the purpose of a note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is trash. Visibility, conflicting notes, bad UE, almost impossible searchability. And I'm a heavy payed user for years. Why? I didn't found better solution and have a looot of notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free account has been rendered usless by the new update. You can only have one device using the app anymore. At that point it's essentially just local storage. It doesn't even need to be online if I can't actually access the data anywhere other than where I created it. After years of use I am switching to Notion. The constant upsell ads from Evernote were annoying, but now they have killed the entire purpose."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Not as good as before for basic users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"MINUS ONE TRILLION STARS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ Want to know why? Just read THE THOUSANDS of reviews that their utter ATROCITY has inflicted upon us!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Google ALSO deserves MINUS ONE TRILLION STARS‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ for not allowing negative ratings--esp. when companies perform VILE, EVIL acts such as this!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A PLAGUE, o' both your houses!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Screw this app. Used to love it. A lot. But now, it is limited to one notebook and one device. Jfc... Now, I painstakingly transferred my notes to Joplin - as Evernote Desktop no longer allows for note exporting - and bought the yearly subscription for far less than Evernote. It lacks the ability to search within notes, which isn't great, but I'm already much happier with Joplin overall. Hope this helps others find an alternative app. RIP I guess, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2 device limit means I'll be looking for an alternative. Rookie mistake, Evernote. Edit: Now it's 1 device LOL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using this app for last few weeks and now it's forcing me to buy premium version... Whenever I open this app again and again it show that I've to purchase the premium version I can't even visit my notes... So much to say but this is not good application at all 😞👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I got Evernote because it CLAIMED you could have 50 notes and connect to two devices with the free version. Well, when I got to THIRTEEN notes, it blocked me from adding anymore, telling me I'd reached my limit when I didn't. THEN they decided to change it and only allow for ONE synced device without warning. It wasn't in any of their 'What's New' updates. One device is absolutely USELESS to me. So, I'm going back to Google Docs!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible impossible to change billing or subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for about 10 years now, and I'm seriously considering closing my account. They keep taking features away from the free version, and with recent updates the app now takes forever to open, is full of ads for paid plans, and it's generally difficult to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to pay to access any of my content"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been a premium subscriber for years, but I'm ending my subscription today. I once loved the legacy version of Evernote, but the app has become bogged down with useless features and is now slow and buggy. I've exported my notes to Notion and will be trying that instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review: I started using Evernote in 2014. It was great until a couple years ago. Then everything started going downhill. I don't even use this app anymore but I have 10 years of notes I can no longer access because of a paywall. As a musician who has used Evernote to write song lyrics and ideas, I am incredibly disappointed and frustrated. I can't even export all my old notes because it won't let me open Evernote on my laptop. And I refuse to pay for an app I don't even like anymore!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pointless now that free accounts are limited to a single device. With 2 devices, I could update my lists/tasks with my PC and then check them off without mobile phone. Not any more. I'll be slowly migrating to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free version will not allow you to sync two devices (such as your phone and desktop)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Right now I'm not sure what to think. I can’t get to my information because it keeps getting blocked by an upgrade that I don't want. What can I do?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not realy suitable for non subscribers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"evernote just blocked my access to it forcing customers to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst ever app. It used to be excellent a few years back. I'm suddenly unable to access my notes...no warning, nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this for years found it great. Recently the persistent and constant ad to upgrade pops up every time you open the app. V annoying. Yesterday without warning no access as limited to one device. As I tried to get my data moved I've been u able to access the app due to the popup. I've emailed got a watery response. I'm furious as all my work & private passwords& information is stored there with no access. Do not download the app. Previously recommended it to everyone but now it's a nightmare."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years and years. It's been great, but slowly they started taking features away from the free version. Then with this latest update you can only sync one device, so I have to choose between the desktop and the app version. If I only found out about Evernote now, maybe I would do the paid version. But I experienced them taking features away, and I do NOT like that. Makes you think, what else are they going to cut? I'm in search for a replacement app. I am so annoyed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"At first, this was my number 1 second brain app, but a few years later its regular package was limited to only sync to 2 devices (I was like oke, cz I only have 2), then yesterday it can only 1 sync, and now, I could not open my note at all because it said, ""You can’t unsync devices more than twice per month. Upgrade to sync unlimited devices. This session will close in 7 minutes."" You shall know that the upgrade you offer is the one going to fail this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app won't let me do anything without paying for a subscription, after being free for years. Wouldn't recommend unless you like a screen popping up telling you to pay £8.99 a month or lose all your notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps removing features, now suddenly I can only access notes on one device unless I upgrade to an extremely overpriced subscription, so I couldn't get to my notes at a critical time yesterday. Annoyingly forces updates on PC without letting you choose when to update, so you're stuck with buggy updates - one duplicated all my notes. Gradually got worse and worse, but suddenly revoking access to just one device (without warning) was the last straw, moving to the Notion App, which is much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant keep 2 devices synced without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In Android version, there is not any option of export pdf in Smartphone. You can't make any pdf from app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, ir was so useful, then I downloaded it on my new phone a few months back and I've only had issues since. The android format is now very different, notes aren't in alphabetical order anymore and every time I go to type something in a list it duplicates, or won't save it- yet keeps things I already deleted. I even uninstalled and reinstalled and it did not fix it. Update: free version doesn't let you have but one device defeating the purpose- it sucks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a new user I don't like and am put off by the heavy emphasis and pressure to pay for a subscription right off the bat. Feels like my data is going to be ransomed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The hell you can't open your own note if you not renewing your subscription!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Better options out there. Constantly trying to get you to subscribe. You can now only have one device without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Write down notes, reminders or keep pictures to remember in an easy-to-access suite. UPDATE Aug. 9th 2024: The app is asking for subscription to have more than one device synced (including web browser). Also it is limiting the ability to unsync a device up to two times per month. This is a very aggressive approach to force payments, therefore considering alternative options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years. Yesterday when I tried to access my notes, I can't even get to them as it kept on incessantly going back to a prompt for me to subscribe for paid version. Please, if you said free version is limited to 50 notes, then just abide by what you said and provide accordingly. There are so many free apps out there which do the same job. I'm trying to paste my notes and be done with you. Why restrict users out of blue, totally frustrating and uncalled for! Thumbs down!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PAID APP. This app has been my go-to (free) app for almost 10 years. Last year they started nagging for payment plans, which were very annoying but possible to ignore. Then, they started limiting my number of notes I could have, and started nagging some more. Now I cannot even open my notes anymore, because I have 'too many devices' in use while I did not add any device. Very sad to be forced to leave my to-go app with sentimental notes. Horrible service for long time users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version after a while forces you to buy it and cant recover any original notes you had on there, now having to pay 14.99 just for a month to get back my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting worse, now they only allow one device for free users making this app utterly useless. Greedy company, clunky app, absolute garbage. They also format the text such that if you tried to copy and paste into another app, it messes up. This app is a trap and isn't worth your time. On top of that, it is constantly asking you to pay for functions that they are gradually removing over time. Highly NOT recommend. So many other note taking apps that does so much more for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always showing ads. Not at allowing to open the notes. Always the ad page is appearing on the screen. So many things are saved here. Not able to open anything. Please help out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very angry! I *purchased* this app, and ever since, I have been nagged to also subscribe to the app??! Then, the app hit limits on how much I could add to a note. Finally, the app turned into Ransomware by locking me out of my own notes and telling me that I MUST subscribe!! Stay away. Stay away!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Copying all my notes and deleting the app. I'm sick and tired of the ads and asking you to upgrade and now forcing you to upgrade or the app keeps glitching on you. Had it for many years and was my go to for notes but it's okay there are plenty of note apps. Do NOT download this trap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Abysmal the 8/6 Update. I've been using evernote for about 4 years now and it used to be a nice note taking app with an easy to understand interface and the bonus of syncing to other devices to use while I'm on the go. It was convenient and simple. Over the last year I feel like prompt to nickel and dime me to upgrade to premium feels like a chore to slog through anytime I open this program. With the removal of device sync on free accounts you're better off just using something else. Terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to pay to use multiple devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is literally unusable unless you have a subscription -_-"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the free version for years. Now it won't let me access my notes without subscribing for $18 per month. Not worth it. Will delete the app unless I can access my notes for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"the new app format doesn't work for me. I've been with them for over a decade, and I'm looking for an alternative product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally completely cut me off from accessing my notes as soon as my storage was full. I get not allowing new notes to be made, but it is literally giving me a pop-up that won't allow me to access the notes I've already got saved at all (if I close the pop-up, it pops back up within a second.) Completely ridiculous, disgusting attempts at forcing people to purchase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"80 dollars a year for a notepad app. Incredible. They must really be hurting for money. And I'll be using a different app. Maybe try not being so greedy next time. I'd have paid maybe 10$ for a notes app, but you're insane if you think I'll drop 80$ 😂"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but without notice took away ability to sync notes. Gradually they've taken away other basic features. I don't mind paying a reasonable amount for worthwhile features but taking away basic features I've had for years and forcing me to pay to access my data is unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot access my already saved notes, ad for subscription won't go away!!! Been using this since 2013!!!! 🤬🤬🤬"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand, you need money, but now you are just being annoying. Ugh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No tech support anymore. Not since the new owner took it over. The app hangs when clipping a web page, so I tried to get support. I got a form email, then nothing. I followed up and got a form email saying the developers had been notified and they would not be assisting me further. Beware. (BTW, I've used Evernote for 10 years, so I'm not exactly a newbie.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now needs me subscribe or I can't use app smh lost all my saved info"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to edit any notes with free app, despite having only a few notes. Forced to upgrade with repeated limit reached. Abandon!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New upgrade doesn't allow you to see old notes without paying $$$$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was too convoluted, I ended up using the notepad app that came with my phone. It was a pain. Now I hear they are charging even more for it and limiting it even more??? Who is even still using this app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"love what can be done on it, but hate the app on my tablet that never opens the notebook I want, that little wheel keeps turning and does not open the notebook. very frustrating. so I had to switch to my phone to do what I wanted to do because it doesn't open on the tablet no matter what I do, even clearing the cache doesn't work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for FREE for over 10 years. Now I can't access any of my notes, which I desperately NEED. Only get a pop-up saying I need to subscribe for $17/mth. DO NOT USE THIS APP. I only use this app for notes. I'm not sure why I have to pay for something I've used a lot for 10+ years. I NEED MY INFORMATION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"My search was not working, I cleared the cache and data, it's still not working. I uninstalled the app (which was frustrating because I lost all my saved notes on my android home screen). Then after reinstalling the app and trying to log in the app won't even open it just gives me a link to download a log. This isn't the only issue I have with the app there are countless issues that just keep building up... More reasons to move my database to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Slow and constantly trying to make me pay for it (and it's not cheap), and now it's only allowing access from one device. USELESS You've made this app unusable for non paying users. Definitely going to find another note app 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was Excellent but now my notes are held for ransom so🫠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for 6+ years and now ALL of my notes are locked behind a paywall. Cannot even check them. This app is now a paywall subscription scam. Use generic notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is not a note taking app. This is a note hostage app. I've been using this app from the beginning and have paid for a few years too. It's been and it still is a great app; actually better than OneNote I have moved on to. The huge prices and practically making it very hard to export the thousands of notes I have is very bad business practice. ""Someone should look into that too""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forced me into a payment plan, after ~10 years of modest use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love the app for years but now they're forcing you to pay now that they have all your important notes. It's extortion. But there is a workaround. Turn off data and Wi-Fi and you can get to your notes that way. Evernote sucks because of their underhandedness. That is why I'm giving them a one star. Their extortionists"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the hell ever note, I have been using this app for free for years. Now, with no notice, you are charging a $15 per month fee??!! I just want to get my important information off your app now so I can at least physically write it down and yet ya all are not letting me, a pop up keeps popping asking for the monthly or yearly fee. I want my notes!!! This was a great app, now it is trash. Thanks for nothing. Do not install this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app decided no more free syncs with more than one device for free. At least these jerk bags could have given a heads up on this instead of just surprising of it happening one day all of a sudden. I would never pay money for this stupid app as it's become garbage over the years. The last straw was when they went exclusively to double spacing and no choice for single spacing. Now I'm on a rush to switch to Joplin Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Never been so disappointed. Been using the free version and after limiting my synced devices (2) down to one, AND limiting the number of times I unsync a device, I'm basically locked out now and forced to pay if I want to access my notes. In addition to constant offers to pay the plan, I have to leave this app. I just paid for the month so I can grab all my notes and ditch it. Thanks, Evernote. We had a good run."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Screw you Evernote. Just keep moving the goalposts to force people into a paid subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It is a good app for sure but rather pricey. Been using the free version for years and last 2 years it incestantly bugs you to upgrade to the paid version. Well they have stooped to new lows now. I was forced to umsync 2 devices leaving 1 which was fine by me. Next day I'm locked out of the last remaining device. Asking me to unsync devices again but oops unsync limit reached for the month... Good thing all my important note have already been transferred out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me access all of a sudden unless I pay for a subscription. This was free for the longest time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update. After being a customer over 10+ years this is the final nail in the coffin. The free version now only allows 1 sync device. I can't use mobile and desktop then there is no point in continuing. I've used this app since it came out but now the pop ups to pay are extremely annoying. Might be looking elsewhere soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now it's just a money grab app. Constantly bombarded with advertisements to subscribe. Continuously reduces available services. I will delete this as soon as I transfer my notes to a new app. Garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be ok. Now it won't even let me use it on my phone unless I pay. It says I can sync 1 device. I have it on my home computer and my phone that's it. Today it pops up a page on my phone to make me pay for it. I can't use it on my phone and get access to any of my notes anymore. Just pisses me off!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been my favourite note app for years, but it is now horrible to use, so many button presses to even get to your notes if you don't have the premium. On top of that I can't even open the app after the last update, leaving all my notes unaccessible. Can not recommend this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This has been my favorite app for years. Since it was bought and the price went up, I keep wondering where my great app went to! I still use it, but it's glitchy, and I keep wondering how long it's going to take me to look for a replacement..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for more than a decade and it had been working excelent . Now I'm trying to get to my notes and all I get is a subscription ad. I have very important notes here and I can't access to the info. I have this app on l y on my phone. There is no email to write and someone could help me. I need help. I trusted this app so much and now I'm fustrated and disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is the worst app I have ever had the displeasure of utilizing. Greed does not even begin to describe Evernote's developer. I use the app for work, and they will take needed notes and hide them, requesting payment to utilize. Horrible company and app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app, but lots of changes, and aggressive pricing changes without any additional functionality led to my unsubscribing. Now, I'm being billed without my consent, and can't find a way to cancel... Don't bother. Use Google Docs! Use Apple Notes... Use a notebook. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for years but now I'm done. ""Sync up to one device or pay"" how is it even considered syncing if it's only one device? Guess I'll uninstall on all devices then and not sync at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went from being really good to being absolutely unusable. None of the notes I've made are even viewable, which led to a lot of lost data. All it does is spin the loading bar, without showing the note I made. Used to be very good, but now no longer functions. Also, a few previously-accessible functions are locked behind paywalls, like deleting multiple notes at a time. Update 08 August 2024: I wish I could rate this lower. Evernote took yet another feature we previously had and paywalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think most everyone knows why."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be much better, every new update brings more annoying bloat that lags the app and shuts previously available features behind a paywall. Unpaid users can expect to spend most of their time on this app closing ads and promotions instead of actually writing anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable app with free version. Seemingly every input, earasing a letter, typing a letter, pressing any menu function etc. prompts them to suggest the paid version. The pop up style and shape, wording and where it appears on the screen varies I guess in the hopes you will get confused and accidentally sign up. Absolutely don't need a SaaS notes app and as someone who has gone from being a free-to-paid user I can promise making the free version impossible to use isn't the funnel you hope it is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incredibile quanto questa app sia peggiorata nel tempo! Pop up invasivi ogni 3 secondi, interfaccia lenta, possibilità di mantenere soltanto un dispositivo sincronizzato se non si acquista l'abbonamento... In più ultimamente sto avendo problemi con alcune immagini che avevo inserito nelle note, che non si caricano più... Da 5 stelle a 1 stella, complimenti!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for several years now. Recently they have been pushing users towards signing up for a subscription service but you could decline. Now they are purposely misleading and lying to me to force me to pay for a subscription. They claim I have synced devices beyond what the free plan allows and they will not unsync these devices for free. Absolutely evil."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD - AFTER FREE USE THEY TRY TO FORCE A SUBSCRIPTION AND LOCK YOU OUT. Used this for years, and now they are ""sticking it to me"". EVERNOTE, I HAVE GONE BACK TO ONENOTE -THIS US YOUR OWN FAULT! Update:2024 Don't get this app. They let you use it for free and then block access to your notes unless you purchase a subscription. DO NOT DOWNLOAD."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible now, it's a complete money grab now and there's so many free notes apps that compare that I'm surprised by this move for them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use Evernote to keep my day and my life in order. Evernote is a great product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate evernote app now. Ever since it has made premium, its just charging for making notes. I would rather use ms word or any other software which are free. Overall extremely disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop trying to offer me a deal every time I click on something. That's bs I've been using Evernote for years but I'm about to switch to another notebook. I'm not interested in your paid service. Just let me use the app without an offer every time I click on something. ""Last offer"" ""one time deal"" your marketing team sucks too. You guys are getting worse every day"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nothing but adds pop up on the free version. I can't even do anything in the app because adds pop up every few seconds wanting me to upgrade to premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"forced upgrade premium to access old notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It looks useful enough at first but very quickly starts pestering you about having to buy a plan to keep using the app (there isn't a ""I don't want a plan, let me continue"" button, misleading you into thinking that you NEED to pay to keep using the app) If you try to access your offline notes without internet access, it may randomly not work at all anymore, and since it has forced Cloud saving, if you try to unsync your phone because you only want offline notes you get locked out of your account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be free. Now need to pay. F off"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't even bother. I've used this app for my notes for the last 12 years. Daily usage multiple times, I loved it. It did everything I needed in a note app and more. But they ruined it. I can't even access the app and use the website at the same time anymore without paying $10+ a month or more? Are you kidding me? I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for years. You can only have 50 notes, why use them when Google docs exists? Their expanded storage is $1.99. Why pay $11/month for this? Why is the app Auto Rotate when my phone has it disabled? Why should I put up with pop ups that are only there to beg for money? I even tried premium for a year, no change in quality/features. Would happily pay for this like $2 / month, get to keep everything in one place, sync devices. Need to seriously rethink their target demographics. NEVER NOTE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be free. Pop up adds constantly trying to make you pay for every detail. Just got on yesterday and now they make you pay if you want to use it for more than one device. Used this app for years but now will be deleting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to offer free services but little by little they are taking it away. I don't recommend it. There are better options for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the worst app ever. The company's desire to monetize everything is appalling. The moment to change the app has just arrived."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 5. Now 1"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. I had been a user since it was a start up - unlimited devices, unlimited notes. Had the features and organizations I needed, then started to take away features and final straw was limiting my access to 1 device. Then there was the more frequent pop up ""buy up to Premium"" ads. Look for alternatives - stay away from them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app since it was on the Play Store. Was great, then now it's getting worse, and worse, with pop-ups to upgrade is so annoying. Now charging me to unsync a device after 2 times. That is getting sad and a terrible way to force people into a subscription. If somebody would ask what note system I would use, it would be microsoft Word or even samsung notes. Fix your system Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over 10 years, and It was great. But now they force you to pay their $15 a month subscription or they bomb you with ads and messages about their premium plan. Everything is limited and I'm going to be switching to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have had Evernote (free) for over 10 years, and the time has come to find something new. Only being able to use it on one device at a time is way too inconvenient. And constantly harassing me, trying to get me to go premium every single time I open the app is not how you get premium users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Es Leuft sehr langsam und speichert die Bilder nicht Automatisch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why it now forcefully asks me to pay? This is insane when I don't want to use paid version why it doesn't let me access my notes. Disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's happened?! Since installing the update the app has turned to rubbish. Takes ages to load notes, crashes frequently, starts scrolling down a page for no reason. Loads of issues. Update Aug 24 : no warning, they've stopped my access to ALL my notes because I now have to pay a subscription. Thieves. I'll pay one month so I can copy my notes over but I'm done with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my No.1 choice since 2013, but now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Would be a great free app but aggressive pop-ups for paying for premium as well as glitchy pop-ups for notifications that no longer apply. Overall the pop-ups ruin using the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"An email I recieved from Evernote ""⚠️ As of August 6, 2024, Evernote Free accounts are limited to one connected device at a time—now’s your chance to save on Evernote Personal and connect an unlimited number of devices"" Thank you for informing me of the need to find another note service. 2 devices for free was too few, one is unacceptable. I will transfer all of my notes off of Evernote. Forcing people to upgrade will cause people to leave. Enjoy the fruits of your labor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You are keeping my notes hostage. Why wasn't I told a date that the free version would end? Such a mean thing to do. Please help me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I had this app for years and seen how it has transitioned to a newer platform. I just needed a minimalist option where I had it on my phone and could occasionally log on to their website to clean up my notes and view them. They blocked me from looking at my notes yesterday because I had these two places synced saying I could only have one. I am done with this app, between all the aggressive apps and now this, it ain't worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for ruining what was otherwise a solid notepad app. Can't even create notes anymore as it's of course locked behind a pay wall now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2 device sync 😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overrated, not free. Forces you to payment either way after some time. You can't even take your notes and go, it kicks you out if you don't pay. I'd rather using calculator than this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most irritative app I even seen in last 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App loads slowly Free user is limited as hell. Tried exporting my content and leaving, but on web it is only 1 by 1. Tried doing the same on the desktop app and then the app shut me out in all platforms because logout limit was reached. I joined years ago when the terms were feasable. Evernote - worse decision Ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"РАНЬШЕ БЫЛО ЛУЧШЕ. Сейчас лишь бы бабла срубить. То количество заметок сократят, то число дивайсов. Скоро буквы платными сделают. И куча навязчивой рекламы о подписке. Скучаю по старому Evernote. Сейчас от него не осталось и следа. Отстой👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I didn't know app can be THAT annoying with Premium persuasion..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app WAS wonderful at one time. We have used Evernote for years and absolutely loved it. A few years ago they made it so you could only use 2 devices and limited the functionality of the ""free"" version. We had no issues with that, it's completely understandable, if you want all the stuff then you need to pay, that is totally reasonable! Now they changed it again and can only have 1 device. And to have the full version the prices are RIDICULOUS! Unreasonablely high. Very very disappointed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app, automatically multiplies the notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even read my notes without ENDLESS UNCLOSEABLE POPUPS saying to upgrade for over $100 or else I can't even look at my notes I've had for years. Total garbage app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Big pile of excrement is this Ever-Failure app. We are forced to accept ONE device unless we pay??! There are plenty of note apps out there that are equal, or better, than this sorry-@ss product. I am done with those nitwit decision makers. I will now ditch this stupid app and piss on this Ever-NO junk! 👎🤬👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had to stop using Evernote on phone as free account got limited to one connected device. One star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless unless you subscribe. I use to love this app, had it on my phone and laptop so I could edit between them. I love a list have have everything on this app. It used to be amazing, but the free usage is being pushed further and further out. As others have said you get spammed with the sign up every time you use it, and now you can only use it on one device. It's become so painful to use so it's time to shift to another note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can Evernote fix the typing issue. I only have this issue with Evernote. Find that sometimes after typing a few letters it gets stuck or jumps to another line for no reason. Happens with both tablet and mobile version. Using Android. Using version 10.99.1. Has been happening since the paid subscription came into place. I am a paid subscriber, so please fix this. It is very difficult to write notes when the virtual keyboard within Evernote does not work after a few keystrokes. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a long time Evernote user (more than 10 years), but the latest round of stripped features really nailed the coffin for me. Instead of offering more features for paid tiers, Evernote has been walking back basic features from its free plan for some time. Users used to have unlimited notebooks, notes, and device sync/logins, but now you're limited to only existing notes on one device. I've become incredibly disappointed with this route of profitability and am migrating my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use this app to note down my thoughts , unsent messages to people and good quotes. Since a year now the app has been showing frequent notification for taking a paid service which is not even my requirement. The notification is so frequent that you can't even open one single note already existing in the app. It's gettinf pathetic. Looks like I will have shift to a new app for the service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after 7 years of experience using at starting level it was god but now it's asking every second display popup message for bye the plan,due to this reason I am not able use my old data. (my advice to you if it will continuous throwing the popup for plan registration definitely will decrease the users to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can you use an app that is so pathetically slow and useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for a long time. Now, it has to be paid. I lost all notes.. Thanks a lot!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I first downloaded Evernote, it provided me everything that I needed in regards to note taking. But now they are forcing all of their users to purchase a membership in order to annotate any more notes, and I will now be moving all of my notes to another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for more than 7 years now. It was good then but now Evernote is extremely annoying. I can't access my notes anymore. The paid wall keeps popping up every second. You shouldn't force anymore for payment let there be an option for free and premium membership. But now I am being harassed into making payments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Dropping my review to 2 stars, latest update made the app unusable. I have over the free limit of notes but cannot even read them without getting a popup to pay. I don't care if I can't edit but I should at least be able to read my notes free. Love this app and use it all the time, both for notes and writing, but PLEASE find a way to stop it rotating with screen orientation. I have rotation on my phone turned off, all unnecessary permissions disabled, looked up troubleshooting online to no avail"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As others have stated in other reviews, Evernote used to be godly, like the S-tier of note taking apps on mobile all for free. Lately, that functionality has deteoriated significantly for free users, spamming users constantly upon using the app to sign up for their subscription-based membership to take more notes and unlock more devices. Device limit was really no problem, but the note limit really harmed original owners of the app with no grandfather clause to retain that. Update: It got worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Jeez Evernote, what a blatant money grab. Only one active device at a time & can only switch which device is active 2x/month? What a bunch of BS. I made one switch and when I went to make a 2nd it paywalled me when it shouldn't have & basically held my notes hostage. I paid for one month in order to recover my info rather than fight w/ CS then turned right around & canceled. Not getting any more of my $. Have purchased Upnote instead, $31 for lifetime unlimited, very happy with price & features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version no longer allows more than one device. DO NOT UPDATE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app will no longer be a good and useful app. I lock up and can't read. Please don't waste your time or money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am frustrated because I am unable to retrieve my information. I just learned that this app has upgraded and wants to charge a heavy fee in order to get my saved information. This is totally a hot mess! Definitely without notifications that I would have to pay a fee. How can I get my information from your app? Any person who used this system should be allowed to retrieve their information."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free option now comes with aggressive upgrade messages. Unable to empty trash, message to purchase appears immediately and keeps popping up when cancelled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the Evernote app for years. It was free when I started. It's ""OK"". I made the mistake of relying on the notes I put on the app. Recently, I attempted to access my notes and discovered I was unable to do so without upgrading to a plan with a monthly fee. It started with annoying advertisements prompting to upgrade to a plan that I did not want. Now, my notes are being held for ransom for a fee. If you are willing to overlook the immortality well, good luck with that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WARNING! This is a scam run by shysters and charlatans. Avoid at all cost. Do not give them a dime."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sick of it forcing an advertisement EVERY time you open the app, and their paid plans are expensive. There are so many other good, free, note-taking services. It was a great service for so many years, and I would pay a reasonable amount to keep using it, but I'll just use Google instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they've completely destroyed this beautiful app over the past 12 years. such a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like this app very much. It has a free option. I somehow created multiple notes, which took me over the note limit. I could not delete the notes unless I had to pay for a subscription. The app would not let me correct the mistake... I would like to be reimbursed for this cost..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is now forcing me to purchase a subscription just to view my old notes not creating new ones and not giving the option to export. you will be hearing from my lawyer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for over 6 years, and having the free version was perfect for what I used it for. I was able to sync my notes from my phone and my laptop (2 devices). Now, I'm only able to use it on 1 device, so it is time to move to another note-taking app. I'm not paying a subscription just to be able to take notes. Also for the past few years there has been an endless amount of asking to upgrade messages every time I open the app. IF I DON'T WANT TO UPGRADE, I DON'T WANT TO UPGRADE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using the free Evernote for many years, I have given up and uninstalled. Since being taken over by Bending Spoons, they have constantly bugged me to ""upgrade"" and now reduce use to one device. Sorry, I will use other alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit #2 (8/2024) - yes I know I've reached my notes limit, but you guys don't have to consistently make pop-ups for purchase reminders - can't even open my previous notes 0 stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"doesn't load when you need it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app years ago. Now it's a textbook example of how to ruin a good app with cheap nickel and dime tactics."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible I can no longer access my notes because of a popup"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow greedy much! If I could give zero stars I would. The devs have now made it so one device & one device only will work without subscription. Two was perfectly reasonable but hey have fun I'll be finding another app that's not run by greedy devs that want to nickel & dime their users. Welcome to late stage capitalism folks it's all downhill from here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"THE WORST note app. Do not install. You will regret this EVIL DECEPTIVE subscription TRICKS. Daylight ROBBERY. Unable to create new notes & unable to sync more than one device, unless you consent to being robbed. Evernote completely ruined their reputation by downgrading backtracking used to be free features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They retroactively revoked my access after 10 years because they want me to pay their new subscription to use the features I have had my whole life. Useless money gribbers who can't even code an app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I 'was' great until today...they don't allow me access my notes unless I pay.. GRIDDY b a s t a r d s"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You put data in... Once you have a lot of data committed, they then insist on high payments to access it. A scam. Do not trust."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another long time user leaving and very mad with the upgrading pop-ups. Free options are terrible now. It used to be a good app. Don't download unless you are open to pay huge price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is unusable now, only gives you a few seconds at a time before locking you out and trying to get you to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of today I am moving on from Evernote. I've used it for years but over the last year they been restricting what you can do unless you pay. Now I can only use 1 device on it. I decided to start using Google Keep Notes as my main app. It's a shame. I used to love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not only did they limit the maximum amount of notes that can be created, but also now the app isn't even letting me back up my existing notes and just puts a pop up of a subscription plan that doesn't let me do anything else. Terrible app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From the best note, to the worst note after they reduce device limit almost every year, and now we only have one device limit, and it even count the web version, do you call that syncing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So sad to see what this app has become I'm going to export all my notes and delete this trash off my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Anyone considering this app should note the high number of 1-star ratings. The app owners are greedy, placing insanely high paywalls and growing restrictions on what used to be free features. If you think a note-taking app is worth £80 a year, you're delusional. I'd wager even if you DID pay, they'd eventually strip your access to functions to put in a higher-tier paywall again in a few years. DO NOT USE - GO ELSEWHERE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have stored all of my writing here for over a decade. I enjoy the app on a basic level, and though I am noticing the growth in the platform, I only use it for storing my work and writing. Is there a price point that would cover the cost to maintain my account/storage plus the features I utilize? Regardless of my appreciation for this app and its growth, I will still have to find another solution by next year due to pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Occasionally used free version of evernote for years. Not worth paying since I only use it every few months. Then suddenly the app pay-walled my data without warning and is holding it hostage, demanding payment to retrieve it. Do not use this app for anything important or you may lose it on a whim."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had free version and it has now locked me out without warning and I cannot access my data without subsc ribing for $15/month"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The greed is real. Used to be like four devices for free. And it went down to two. And now here recently it's gone down to one. But you can pay them $15 a month to have two devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today, I open this app and there's an infinite loop of pop-ups forcing me to either buy a monthly or an annual subscription because I have more notes than it allows. These notes were made before they had a limit on the number of notes you could take as a free user. I will be paying for one month of this stupid app and exporting all of my notes and taking them with me elsewhere. This app is now complete and total garbage and a scam. They are now holding my notes hostage behind a paywall. SCAM"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost access to my notes through my phone, most recent update only allows me to access my notes on my computer on free versuon. Why does this garbage app exist for phones if I cant use it on my phone! I keep needing to check my calendar on my phone and it wouldn't let me, so irritating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keep taking away stuff and putting it behind a pay wall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What used to be a simple, but useful notes app, has turned into a garbage pile of ads that constantly bombards you with ads to upgrade to the premium edition, and now limits the number of notes you can have to 50. At least on free you could at least sync sync two devices. Now they've taken that away as well. This app is now dead and trash and no where near worth the subscription fee they are asking to make it useful again. I've had it for years but I'm out. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App used to be good but now is rendered completely useless unless you pay for a subscription, I've swapped to One Note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this is a NOTES app. it's ridiculous that it asks you to create an account just to open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using the app for many years and now is gone when I knew about That decision about to removed the App with all my life in there because a did not know the changes, I got a tremendous DISTRESS. I would like to know if your company is going to fix it? Tell me that you are going to bring my life BACK. You provoke it. Fix it bringing my information back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was using free version for years and trans all my Outlook notes to this app. In 2023 a steady change of reduced functionality for free version, then free only allows 1 notebook and up to 50 notes... I had 55 notebooks w/about 300 notes. I won't pay to hold my data, esp when you keep reducing funcionality. I migrated to a new app. June 2024 an update made app useless to log into for a while. While I have my data here as a backup, in Aug-2024 they now limit access to only 1 device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 7th Aug, just switch to Notion. An infinitely better app that doesn't bombard you with ads and actually let's you use your notes on more than a single device. • • Honestly the app is okay, I like that it syncs between the app on my phone and the web app but my god, the constant pop ups trying to sell me a premium subscription (which I have to 'accept immediately or I miss the promotion', at least until it pops up 30 minutes later) has me looking elsewhere for another notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Usei este aplicativo por mais de 14 anos. Mantive por vezes planos pagos, outras free. Hoje desinstalei pois as mudanças com essa nova controladora estão sofríveis."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User since 2015, loved it in the past, but became worse year by year, until today restricted me to only 1 device. I will transfer everything elsewhere and goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basic functionalities of the app, like connecting just 2 devices, suddenly becomes paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you for making Evernote unusable with that constant popup to upgrade to sync unlimited devices. Truly wonderful, click it off and pops right back up. This does not make me want to give you money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pop up blocking access to my notes.. Asking me to sign up for year subscription.. No ""x"" or ""close"" option on tge pop up... Very disappointed 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 8 years of trusting this app and it's parent company, I have officially lost hope. It was a slow push with the number of manipulative ads you would have to maneuver. Now, they do not allow 2 devices logged into a free account at the same time. Add to this, you have to pay if you log in to any device more than 2 times a month. I am taking my data elsewhere and uninstalling immediately. Won't be back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You will lose all of your notes. Don't get the free app. You will, at some point be unable to use it, due to pop-ups giving you only the choice to pay for it. It will persist & not let you even get to all of your past notes, effectively destroying your records, as far as you are concerned. This used to be a good free app, & I probably would have eventually upgraded once I got my internet biz going, but now it seems that they have effectively locked me out unless I upgrade now. Use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Block me without warning from accessing my notes. At least warn people before start charging them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. Stored all my stuff on it. Now they want $130 a year. You guys suck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable without a subscription now. Constant pop up ads asking you to subscribe (even though the prices are utterly absurd for a notes app), extremely limited free experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can I give it 0 Stars? Pathetic. Hard to get to ANY notes without upgrading. I think most are now gone. Back up somewhere else while you can and dump this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was using free version of evernote for years. Have years worth of notes and ideas and passwords etc saved. Now I don't even have access to my old stuff because they are forcing you to pay, even to access old notes. This is garbage. Don't use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My standards were low, but now they're even lower. I am moving to Notion and recommend everyone else do the same unless you want this company to suck you dry. This is by far the worst possible notes app to date with lacklustre features and uninspired note organisation methods. I used to use it for free for the past 10 years and was just barely satisfied, now you need to upgrade to premium to even make one simple note???? No. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant open app, says cant unsync, will find alternative app then"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and now I can't use it any more because ever note give me a a pop up every 1-2 seconds demanding me to upgrade to $15 a month plan, $15 a month!!?? you guys are tripping! this app is now unusable without upgrading. ever note you guys suck and your app is not worth paying for I'm installing and I got a feeling this is the end of your company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Highly unsafe app to use. It was a mistake using this app. Get notification every week that someone login from Bolivia, and many other countries"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You are unbelievable! I had this for years and it stored a few poems and recipes. You locked the app without warning so I can't download my things unless I pay a monthly subscription. I am on disability and can't afford that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote but now I can barely do anything without paying. And I cannot afford it. The worst part is that I used to use it because of its device synching, 2-3 devices were great without paying, then it was only 2, and that was still bearable. But then, I cannot have a single synched device without paying... I can use whatever other note app out there that doesn't use wifi for that, thank you. This app became trash for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pay, pay, pay, pay us. Please paaaaay! PAAAAY! Oki, maybe I would if I wasn't annoyed this much by constant pop-ups. I would for sure if I liked the app, but I find it kinda slow for my taste and with too many unnecessary options. Trying to make notes here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for probably 13 years but it has become absolutely unusable. I don't even add new notes but just trying to look at my existing notes I have to get past an astonishing amount of popup offers to upgrade to a premium account, some of which don't even have a button to close, I just have to repeatedly press back to get out of it. it takes 10x longer than it should just to check a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is OK, but the price is ridiculous. I finally set myself free after 17 years as a user. There are better more affordable alternatives out there. I had over 9000 notes. If you downgrade to free you only get 50! Who decides what stays and goes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pop up after pop up after pop up after pop up after pop up after pop up. What was I going to write down again?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for over a decade. Now a paywall out of nowhere to write a note? Smells like new management. I'm taking all my notes and putting it elsewhere then deleting this trash off my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst notepad app ever. I think you guys are brutal and mean to your customers, trying every way possible to force your customers to suscribe when that is not necessary. I hope google removes your app at this point. You give free users a limit of 50 notes, but yet you keep forcing a subscription pop up on your users even though they are under 50 notes. Then you change the max limit for synced devices from what it used to be to force users to suscribe. You guys are cash crabs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Obstructive delaying advertising"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, then the subscribtion pop-ups every 30 seconds were bad enough, and now you can only sync 1 device? Ridiculous. Hope you reap what you sow, considering there are hundreds of other comperable apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not what it iused to be. Very clusterry and heavy moving around . Constant pop up everytime you open it. Older app was easier more relaxed so to say. Anyway I want also to say... I DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION! I ONLY USE YOUR APP ONCE A MONTH FOR 10 SECONDS. Ok I'm uninstalling now , later."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"BS used to love this app until they decided to charge out the wazoo for it. Now, I'm not going to use it until they change that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reduced the number of sync device from 2 to 1. Not any more a convenient note taking app for students. I had to delete one device recently"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for years and now all of the sudden it's telling me my storage is full (when I haven't added anything, I just use it to reference) and I can't even SEE my info without a pop up to make me purchase their ridiculously priced plan... I don't get it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"TOO EXPENSIVE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From best to worst. Finally constanyly annoying offer to buy and just one device. Good buy, green elephant."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Adds always popping up on free version. Now it's making me sign to a paid version to continue to use it. What has happened to the free version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Take screenshots of your notes before you can no longer access them! I'll just go back to doc app for my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly, I can't use it because ""device limit"" reached, and I should pay. I hope to access all my notes on PC, and delete this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app (note)EVER!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After recent update Couldn't see how many devices have been logged in other details"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Simplicity"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The basic version now only on two devices makes this much less useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The only reason I use the app is because the alternative doesn't allow to choose text and auto divide it in bullet points. All the other things are so so bad. It's annoying how desperate the app is begging for money, the latest twist is unsyncing all devices 🙈 I have a suspicion that they are going under and want to gather as much money as they can before disappearing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total trash, I had stored vital information 11 notes in total, on this app, only to be told that my limit had been reached and that the only way to read my notes was to pay for the service. I had to pay for the app and then transferred all my notes onto a different note app, then unscribed and deleted my account!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote keeps changing the interface every few months unnecessarily (I'm sure they believe it's to ""upgrade"" our experience!). And, this keeps slowing the already slow & buggy app down further so that it becomes quite unwieldy (this on S20 Note Ultra with 12 GB RAM) necesitating frequent uninstall & re-install. All this is a classic problem nowadays with the old adage ""if its not broken..."" constantly being ignored..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely no point in keeping this app since Aug 2024 with its new limits to syncing to only one device. I have put up with the endless pop-up interruptions taunting me to pay up. It was handy because I could add notes on both PC and Android and they were properly synced across phone and PC. Now that it's only one? I'm switching to Google Docs. Absolutely zero loss in functionality and no more annoying hurdles. Goodbye, Evernote. You've made yourself obsolete."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but my experience with ios, Windows and Android is extremely frustrating. It takes more than 30 seconds to load a note on ios. On windows, I am deleting the notes but they are appearing again and again. Frequently hanging on ios and windows. I planned to buy paid version but with this experience I am going with color note and Google keep. I arrived at the conclusion that even if this is the last app in universe and it's free, still I won't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"update ruined it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How much money you want money suckers. Even Google doc is better than you. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't do anything now. Anything you want to do in the app is blocked by a pay wall. This is no longer a free app. Bummer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can only use it in one device now? Lol. Fk subscription model."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be a long-term subscriber and have many notes still ""stored"" there. As exporting old notes isn't lossless I still sometimes use the native app, but since it's rare and I don't add new content there is no value in subscribing. Developers make all the efforts for such workflow to be a pain, as annoying pop-ups are ubiquitous. Paying for access to your own data is suspiciously similar to demanding ransom. Go ahead and subscribe if you are into BSDM."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote for many years and recently their application has been terrible with their aggressive marketing to turn free user into paid user. you get literally spam with pay option every time you start the app. what more, their app act weirdly sometimes with notes missing or notes refusing to sync for some unknown reason. i would just migrate to another app to be honest because its obvious that evernote doesn't care about its user but only cares about making a buck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For 3 days bombarded with pay screen impossible to clear for more than a second meaning no access to notes visible. Long term user with small number of notes and only 1 device. Is this the end of evernote. Total disaster. Please do something..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much annoyance of paying adverts. Also device limit was decreased to 1!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"getting trouble logging in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After being an intensive and loyal Evernote user for around 5 years, what you give in return is 1 device only, in free mode?? Are you serious? Take this back or I am switching. And so are almost all your loyal users. Think over this evernote, think over this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Squeezed out of the ecosystem - To wake up and be told I have to unpaid my phone because after 8 years the free version no longer supports two devices is a brutal money grab and the final straw. Goodbye Evernote, I wish you the best of luck. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years with no issues. Over the last year the prompts to upgrade have been happening more frequently. At one point I was told I am over the max number of notes, so I deleted probably 20 old grocery and to-do lists. The app still says I'm over although I know I'm not. The last straw just happened when I was told that I can only have one device synched. I've had this app on my phone and tablet for YEARS! Downloading a new app and copying my notes. Deleting this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hay mucha publicidad, no se puede usar en dos dispositivos a la vez (en la versión gratuita) es sumamente incómodo escribir así. Hay muchas opciones mejores, realmente mala."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now with a limited number of notes and will only sync to ONE device. Was unlimited notes, then three devices. Now it limits the number of notes you can have, the size of each note, and I have to ""unsync"" all devices except one. This is now unusable trash. I could just use a basic notepad app if it's not going to sync. Sad they sold the company and stopped talking care of their customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is very dangerous. I got locked out and only option was to sign up for 7 day free trial. Now I am struggling to cancel sub before 7 days expires."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable. This app used to be very comsumer friendly, now it asks me for money every time I open the app. I used to be able to use multiple notes, now it tells me unless I pay for the premium service it will only let me use a select few and then the final nail in the coffin for me was when it told me I could only have ONE device for my account. I used to be able to have multiple for FREE. Unbelievable. Waste of money if you ask me. This use to be a good app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Solo un dispositivo? En serio? Se pasan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just bad 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now, they try to extort money and hold all your information for ransom to exorbitant monthly fees. Look elsewhere. If I could give 0 stars, I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reducing sync option to one device is predatory and in bad taste.... Will leave using the app than pay for syncing just two devices... Most horrible organisation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the most awesome app, now they charging for more note capacity. Pass... don't download and waste your money, just when you thought this app was getting worse, NOW only one device can be used with it , thank goodness I found a much better app and all the bells and whistles free...time to ditch Evernote, what was good now is a sham for money unfortunately. ABSOLUTELY AVOID & TRULY DISAPPOINTED"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: As of today they started charging to sync more than one device... And only allowing you to unsync two times per month. This app is done! Constantly forces upgrading, also I cannot create any new notes because it says I hit a 50 note limit...This app is now useless! These companies need to go back to charging a reasonable one-time fee like $9.99 instead of trying to trap customers with subscriptions, this subscription SCAM is played out!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Nagware"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years and loved it. Then they started limiting how many notes you can have with the free version which was an inconvenience, but I understood. I'm giving a one star review because I opened the app today and now the free version of the app is limited to only sync on one device. The reason I used this was to keep notes synced on my phone and computer. On top of removing features you are also spammed with pop ups everytime you open your notes telling you to pay the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm very annoyed that you will not let me access my notes at all with out signing up to pay a monthly fee. Give me my notes back so I can copy and remove them from this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: was using Evernote for a long time, but over the years regular issues have made the use frustrating. Evernote all of a sudden forced me to go for a paid version. There was no warnings email or notification before. It would even let me access my current notes. Somehow I found out there was additional login, which I had to logout to be able to use the notes again. I will be switching out of this app pretty soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote for years, but it's become too pushy and difficult to use. If I want to write down something quickly before I forget, I have to hold it in mind as I click through sometimes multiple ad screens to get to my notes. The app didn't use to be like this. It feels lame to make the app unusable to force a subscription. I finally got a new note app today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Una pena haber empezado a ocupar Evernote. Cuando uno lo necesita no funciona Dx"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying advertisement. I decide to uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but this year they've kept limiting access more and more until you pay. Now I can't even view my past notes without paying $15+ a month. Honestly ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years and it used to be the best, but this once-choice app has devolved into useless garbage with an outrageous paid subscription structure. The free version is limited to just 50 notes on a single device, with upgrade popups interrupting you constantly. The subscription prices are ludicrously expensive, and the paid version is notoriously glitchy and slow. It's no wonder once loyal users like myself are leaving this app in droves."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love the app. Now I have a pop-up message that says I have reached the limit. I cannot view or delete old notes unless I subscribe annually or pay the monthly $15.99 fee. I had considered subscribing to support the developers, but I hate this type of underhanded tactics to extort money from users. Going to pay the monthly fee once so I can export my notes, then telling all my friends not to use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You won't even allow us 'free' users to obtain our data. I might have subscribed but won't now as you have locked me out unless I subscribe. Cheap and shoddy. Let us make that decision. Once a winner... now a loser."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They get you to put all your stuff on it ""for free"" then spend every minute holding your information for ransom. Do not get this app unless you want to commit to paying loads every year until you die. It's not like it's a small amount, I would have been happy to pay. Every time you're locked out of your own information"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2012 and for the most part it's been great. But the developer just gets more and more greedy. I was ok with only 1 mobile device and webpage access. But now they want me to pay for that. Plenty of better free options out there so I'll be moving on. Thanks for being the first good note taking app on Android. What a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I haven't used this app in a while due to previous issues relating to slow speeds and usability. However, I have returned to write a new review and I want to warn all notetakers to AVOID EVERNOTE AT ALL COSTS. I know a guy who has thousands of notes over the span of a decade on Evernote, and one day, all of his notes were blocked behind a paywall. They don't even let a person access their notes so they can at least transfer some of their notes to another platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing people to pay subscription in order to continue using the app is a new low for Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024-08-06: Evernote (that since the beginning advertised having a free plan) now is demanding to be paid, so I can't access my files. This is blackmail - if this persists, I may pay, but on the next day after exporting my files, I'll never EVER want to hear about this brand in my life (and legally proceed against, as well). It's truly a shame, taking people to use a service and then suspend it, against the previously agreed basis. Never thought Evernote could use such a low trick..!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until the newest update! Can only have 1 synced device (so either your device or the website!) Used to have unlimited notes. And they have the audacity to try and charge $18 a month or $150 a year!! Maybe make it a 1 time purchase wouldn't be too bad but still ridiculous!! Will definitely be looking for a better alternative now!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great features. I find it indispensable. One issue is that it can be slow, since I have to wait for my phone and the Evernote site to communicate. An unavoidable trade-off, I guess."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years! I loved it. Now, it's making me buy it. Why would I buy something that's been free for YEARS! Do, I just would dismiss them asking me to pay. I was deleting a lot of the notes I don't use any longer. Now, I can't see anything anymore. It won't let me get to the ones I've been using. I have my mom's obituary stuff in there and it won't let me access it anymore unless I pay. That's HORRIBLE! I HATE YALL SO MUCH RIGHT NOW!!!! I used this app because it was great & free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a user for so long now wanted me to subscribe. Worst part is all my data is in there. Furthermore, there is no way to cancel the subscription. Evernote you have outdone yourself. 👏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to LOVE Evernote. It's was one of my fav apps and I've been a PAID subscriber for years BUT this year, it seems like with every update Evernote gets SLOWER & SLOWER. I have a new Pixel 8 phone and a new Pixel tablet... still SLOW."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is completely unusable garbage. Been using it for a decade or more and it is just getting worse and worse. I can't even type a single word without spam. I would give it a 0 if possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many popups trying to get you to buy a subscription. I can't even bulk export my notes. Now, I can't even log in in the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First they restrict the number of documents I could generate, unless I pay a fee and subscribe to the service. Now they only allow one device to be used, unless I pay a fee and subscribe to the service. Well I'm NOT going to subscribe to the service. Therefore, good-bye (fee infested) Evernote, hello (free) Samsung note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not easily work across platforms, after evernote made updates, lost access to content without warning. Pretty disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had it free for years and now they want me to pay annual fee to keep notes? No way. No thank you. I'll better go to my handwrite notes on paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of using this app, I'm at my wits end with it, and it's lack of support. The pricing model is predatory and a complete scam. They slowly disabled the free features and without warning are requiring a subscription at about $15 a month. Besides that the app is glitchy as all heck, and I don't know how anyone can trust it. They don't even allow you to contact a support team without a business tier plan. I can't believe Google allows this app on its store. Yank it PLEASEEEE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The number of notes and syncing across devices was a big deal for me switching between PC and mobile. Then they changed the plans where free could no longer create notes after a certain point then changed the number of synced devices to a singular device. I considered subscribing for the features, but while pasting notes to a secondary place, the app ""copied"" (deleted) the note, crashed, and saved the blank note. The content is gone forever and not on clipboard. They charge for Spaghetti code."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Really convenient app, versatile, suits my needs perfectly Editing my review. After using this product for many years they keep cutting access and now finally in an effort to make me pay I can only use on one device. Great product but now less convenient If you can afford to for it. Way too expensive for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Widget doesn't work anymore. 😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. Once free, now you try bullying me into buying it by limiting me to all sort of things that wasn't so in the beginning of using the app. Will definitely be uninstalling it and won't recommend it for anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app constantly pressures you to pay for expensive subscriptions. I'm starting to look for other options because this doesn't seem like a good company or app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgraceful. It's unbelievable to force you to pay nearly $100/ year for a bloody notepad. Yeah, no thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not paying 8.99 to write notes on the phone. Can't review past made notes unless I pay a premium account. I wouldn't mind paying a one-time fee but monthly cost? you're having a laugh. I'll stick to pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update has limited synced device to only 1 for free version. That's pathetic. I have been using evernote for 3 years almost. But now I think I have to shift elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2012. WHY CAN I NO LONGER OPEN MY NOTES WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY? THIS IS BLACKMAIL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep finding new and creative ways to make this app more and more terrible. Honestly it's become unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only one synced device. Two device disconnections per month. And a browser session (in a PC that is currently off) counts as synced device. My notes are inaccessible. Congratulations to whoever owns Evernote now. You managed to kill it. I have been using it for the better part of 8 or so years. To any potential user, please look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blackmailing me while blocking access to my notes. After many years, today a pop up asking for subscription money and not letting me copy my own data and Uninstall this malware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app will block your notes eventually if you don't pony up. Don't trust this if you want to use it as a free version, you might not be able to get your notes back. I mighta paid if the app was better about not holding your data hostage but GEEEZ LOUISE IT'S TOUGH TO LOSE ALL THOSE IDEAS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: now you can only have one device, so nothing to sync anymore. ABSOLUTE TRASH Excessive paywalling - banners, popups, notifications - all for excessively priced ""one time"" special offers that repeat daily. Sometimes I get ""lucky"" and am offered this ""deal"" twice within 10 minutes! Every couple of months it seems there's another restriction added (unless you pay) behind the scenes, so despite being an infrequent user this platform is becoming unusable and untenable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for at least 8 years. It was great until the new update. I used it because I could instantly connect with my notes. The shortcut option does not make it easier to use. It just places little gold stars next to the title. Under a list of most recent notes that were opened. I may be experiencing a moment of not accepting change, but when it's not broken, why fix it? Now, we can't have more than 1 device synced to the app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why can't I edit my notes anymore?? Now they all say ""view only"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked out, I use the basic package which allows syncing to two devices. It's saying I need to remove one device. I see online that lots of people have had this issue for years, and it's been communicated to Evernote but they don't fix this bug. Looks like the bug is a way to make you pay if you want to access your notes again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash! Do not install or use. Was a great app now they want $129 so I can make another note. Moving everything off it. 🤬🐄💩 Now I'm can't even open my own notes unless I pay. 🖕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So the app decides to completely lock us out of our notebooks unless I pick a paid plan since the update!?!? If that's how Evernote wants to function why would I want to subscribe to you guys. Unreal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not recommended"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Virou um programa caça níquel. Estou partindo para outras alternativas."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app for years. Every time I chages phones this app has come through with all my data. Now I cannot access any notes or other info unless I pay subscription fee??? I keep the same 3 notes.... nothing crazy but I still need to pay to even view my data!?!?? Logged in online. Screenshot my notes, changed apps, and un-installed evernote. Bye and thanks for the mini heart attack while trying to get to my password"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over a decade, and I'm just shocked at how I'm being pressured to upgrade to a subscription. Just arbitrary features rolled out to limit your access TO YOUR INFORMATION. First, I couldn't create any more notes because they implemented a 50 note limit. Now, I can only use the app on one device unless I upgrade. This is such a bait and switch! Don't use any free version of the app. They will hold your info hostage and force you to upgrade out of fear of losing info."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It does not work properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Non stop to ask user to pay and can't not do anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dont ever put information you need on this garbage app. It will make it inaccessible by constantly giving you ads to upgrade, making it impossible to view anything until you do. Used to be my favourite note keeping app for years and now it is absolute garbage. Basically unusable unless you pay for premium services you will never use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using it for a couple of years because my boss is making us use it. It's been free for what I use it for. Today there's a pay wall saying I'm maxed out and it will automatically renew. No warning about limit. Didn't know there was one or is this a glitch. Fix it and I'll improve the rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This WAS a great free note app for several years, until it got greedy. Now every time I open it, it won't let me proceed until I decline a popup trying to upsell some ""premium"" upgrade BS. Not sure what more premium I would even need to simply keep personal notes, anyway (?). Today it actually made me disconnect one of the devices I had connected for years. With all of the pop-ups and new restrictions, sadly this has now turned into a piece of $h1t."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow... Forcing people to pay to use your app is one thing. But to prevent people from accessing their notes until they pay up is a new level of scummy. I hope your company burns to the ground, because that's what you deserve. All the worst, your ex user 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To export your notes to a format that you can import into Obsidian, google ""GitHub yarle"" and follow the instructions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Out of the blue, Evernote declared I had exceeded my limit for the Free plan and had to subscribe to continue. I mostly used it for my grocery and to-do list, but had a few important numbers in one of my lists. The only way to access my notes was to subscribe and pay. I've copied my notes, and now I need to unsubscribe. Wish me luck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For some reason I toughed it out with this godforsaken app after all the changes and cutbacks to the free version. Now I go to log in on a random afternoon after using it fine all morning and am informed that I have reached my device limit, and I'm now only allowed one device instead of two. God forbid anyone enjoy the perks of being able to access a notes app on a laptop and a smartphone without paying $80+ a year for it. Thanks for the middle finger evernote, will be switching immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't use it now because the subscription page keeps popping up, what's going on?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Actually infuriating. I've been using this since the mid 2010s to track notes but they've been harassing me to pay since last year and are now saying i can't access MY NOTES that I've had forever unless I pay. I'm going to transfer my files into the native app and install this scam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has the limit and when you reach it, the commercial adds for subscription won't let you using app. Horrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would give it 0 stars if possible. Used to be a great app for syncing my notes between two devices that run different operating systems. Over time kept asking for premium subscription and would spam me with endless ads when trying to browse my notes. And now finally it only allows only 1 device to be synced for the free tier. Absolute trash, youve taken away all of the usefulness of the app for the consumer to push a predatory payment system, so it is now completely unusable. Absolutely tragic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could put no stars, I would. Used to be a fantastic app I have used for years, loved it for a long time. Started to get annoying witn constant ads for versions you need to pay for but managed to ignore them UNTIL Without warning, can't use the app at all without paying for a premium version. Had to screenshot all my notes inbetween this pop up CONSTANTLY appearring to retype onto a new app. Absolute rubbish now. Do not download unless you want to pay ridiculous amounts of money for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increasingly restrictive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The phrase ""keep synced up to 1 device"" is self-explanatory. Not for free usage anymore. But was very useful before"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Found not useful to me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't stand using this app anymore. I used to love this app but over the years, it has started to become more and more money hungry. I only get maybe 10 notes and they took the amount of synced notes from 3 (I believe) to 1 device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this for over 15 years, but now looking for other options. Constant harassment to upgrade. Continually removing features from the free version (now only 1 device). Buggy and glitchy, otherwise I might consider subscribing. But the prices are way too high for what you get."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be ok. Now everything is behind a pay wall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get passed the subscription screen. Low move guys. Low move."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is my 3rd review to the Evernote team. Every update is worse than the last and filled with bugs. It's clear you never take on board any user feedback. I've just renewed my subscription for another year, however it will be the last time you get any money from me, I've had enough. As painful as it will be I will begin migrating all my notes to another app immediately. Anyone reading this review, don't get this app, it's now almost totally useless and not worth the subscription fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"8/6/24 edit: Evernote has somehow managed to top its own self-destructive idiocy: now it expects you to pay a minimum of $78 USD for the privilege of accessing your notes from a second device. On top of limiting your number of notes allowed to exist at 50. On top of bombarding you with demands to pay every five seconds. Let this company reap what it has sown and stop using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has slowly removed and reduced the offerings to ""free"" users of the application. A reduction to a 50 note maximum was surprising, but not a deal-breaker. Now that they are restricting users to a single device login is absolutely ridiculous. This will further alienate your core user base, and I would not be surprised seeing many leave for [much] better alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Takes hours from tagging a note to when that note can be filtered by that tag - a real hindrance - also slow response overall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to have free features, but it's all completely paid now. I already had a bunch of notes on there, but I can't even access them because it's asking for me to subscribe for a monthly fee. My phone notes app does almost all of the same stuff for free. I'm going to try to recover what I can of the notes I already had on there before they decided to start charging and uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This just keeps getting worse! Today it informed me that for free I can only have 1 sevice sincronised. Sincronised with what, considering it's only one? :))) You are getting desperate for money and people will find free or at least cheaper alternatives. Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not CREATING EVENTS . Seems to be broken"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth it anymore after the paywall. Oh well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app, but the recent takeover has seen a hard push to rake in the $$$. Now there's not only a limit on the number of notes, now there's a new limit on devices that are syncing. But one of the devices which I'm allowed to sync to, I'm not getting access to evernote on that device and I keep getting the buy a plan pop up?! At least give people a chance to access their notes on the allowed designated devices. Am currently looking for an alternative option instead of Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today is the day I leave Evernote after 13 years. The money gauging is ridiculous. No I don't want to upgrade to premium, I have everything in the free version I need. All the prompts after every click is annoying. First I couldn't make new notes w/o paying, fine I was using it to go back to notes I already had. But now I can't login on my phone and computer at the same time unless I pay? Cool, no worries I just won't use the app at all now. New management sucks and ruined a fantastic app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You are blocking me from accessing my content in the app by forcing me to subscribe. I am not sure this is ethical of you to do. Fixing one to subscribing by blocking access to already existing content is not the way to go. I created that content with the fee option and you should allow access as well with the free option and not force one to subscribe..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Irritating app. Showing payment page one million times after free trail"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are you able to make it even worse?! I'm ok to have free plan with one notebook and 50 notes - but why aren't you giving me even a chance to merge my notebooks or transfer existing notes to a single notebook???? Greedy worthless app. Upd. So now only one device for free plan! Keep going, I will give you a brilliant idea - next limit to 1 note for a free plan!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I originally got the app so that I would have a place to put all my writing notes and be able to edit them on the go. At first it was great, it was free and I could create as many notes as I needed to fully organise, and use Evernote on multiple devices. Then they cut the number of notes able to be created down to 1 notebook and 50 notes. Which is not great for someone with multiple stories they are trying to plan. Then Evernote made it so only one device could be used at a time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Extremely laggy in split screen mode on Android. Paying customer. I read technical books every morning and summarise them on Evernote in split-screen mode on my phone. However, in the past few months, typing out my thoughts into Evernote has become unbearably laggy. I've got a OnePlus 12, which is a new phone, so I'm sure it's the app itself. There's a lag between me typing and the notes appearing. The keyboard will also frequently disappear when I'm typing. Extremely frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this for years for free to sync notes netween phone and pc and with no notice it has changed to paid access. Time to find a new app with better customer communication"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most annoying pop ups I have seen in any app. Free version now lets you connect only 1 device and that defeats the whole purpose of the app and why I downloaded it in the first place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"On what basis did you unilaterally leave me only one device to use? how can this be done? I just wanted to switch to subscriptions, but such arbitrariness in a unilateral order scared me away. I will switch to another program"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy POS, now I can't even add anything to my notes anymore without paying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Would not recommend even to my enemies"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slowly reduced their free service to be almost unusable unless you cough up - trying to force you to pay. Possibly the stupidest way to run a business."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been my favorite notebook for so many years and organised most of my life through it. Now starting to cost and limit of notes as well as some sync bug across devices and copy paste being challenging on the app for whatever reason. Hopeful it will sort itself and not gonna have to find a new . Thanks for these years :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Final Edit: This app has gone from an initial 5 stars, to 2 stars after they started pushing the paid subscription while removing free user benefits and now finally to an unusable 1-star. This app was usable for a while when it allowed a 2-device (laptop and mobile) sync and now in their latest ploy to drive up premium memberships they've made it a 1-device ""sync"" for free users. At that point I might as well use built-in device notepads. Evernote's quality has degraded rapidly over the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You people keep taking away more and more features from the free plan. Now you can have 1 device synced instead of 2. Pretty soon we'll have no option except to pay. I will delete this app before I pay for a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Era uma vez um app queridinho por muitos. Desde a atualização de 2021 o app ficou PESADÃO. E olha que meu smartphone tem 6GB de RAM e Processador de 2.8GHz. Pra que mexer no time que está ganhando? Volto aqui em 2024, depois de ter dado uma chance por 3 anos porque guardo muita coisa importante no App. Já fiz de tudo (atualizei, reinstalei)... mas chegou no limite da minha paciência - virou uma CARROÇA VELHA DE TÃO PESADO E LENTO Evernote para mim virou nEvermore (nunca mais)!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Need to take a quick note? Forget it!!! Must cancel my subscription. This app was so good about 3 years ago. Now it's so CPU intensive and slow and trying to be too smart. It is unusable on my phone. None of the widgets work and everything takes a life age to develop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote app doesn't get open now. It is stuck with the elephant logo. I can't access my notes through mobile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"this is a great app, will be even better for me once I actually learn to use it it's mostly intuitive but there's a couple of things that I don't understand that I need to. I don't really have a problem with the app it's more about my laziness in not wanting to spend one second learning anything about a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frozen not loading. Blank screen with elephant"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enjoyed using this a semester or two ago but now the paywall keeping me from adding more notes is giving me the impetus to switch tools. Shame too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Use this app in all areas of life. I would be lost without it. It's worth every penny and then some."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now free version can only have 1 device synced ? Corporate greed at its finest"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Between the constant pop ups trying to get me to subscribe to a paid plan and the constant issues getting the app to even open evernote has gone from an incredibly useful note app to literally the worst app on my phone. 0/10 don't waste your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My regular note taking app. Essential features for your everyday use in a secure way. Definitely recommended"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not start using this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Enjoyed the app but have chosen to not use due to paywall. Have since been unable to even access my old notes to transfer them to a new app - even though I am nowhere near the quota it gives me on ""free"" notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a long time Evernote fan, but as of late it is really let me down. I depend on Evernote whenever I'm out and about to access information to help me at my job, at the store, and while traveling. The mobile app has completely stopped working. This makes Evernote almost completely useless for me considering I plan everything on my desktop and then go out into the world and use my plans from the mobile app. I also can't jack quick ideas anymore while I'm out and about. Very sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app!!!!! i wish I could give 0 star. Do not install if you don't want problem like I got. I have trusted this app for many years, now all of sudden I couldn't open, even delete the data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used and loved this app for years, but recently I have had issues with not being able to access my notes. I have had to uninstall and reinstall many times just to access my notes again. I have been receiving a pop-up note that says it needs to optimize next time it is open, but the optimizing takes forever and then it just locks up, so I have to uninstall and reinstall to get to my notes. Please help by fixing this. I have a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With this app, you can display a small animation with a white background on your smartphone screen, and share some logs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited free features useful for nothing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app has improved IMMENSELY over the last several months, as has the whole Evernote experience on PC & phone. The return of keeping the screen on so you can follow recipes without constantly having to touch the screen; the ability to export notebooks easily, a functioning addon for outlook, the constant app updates that add features & swiftly fix bugs, the improved loading speed on opening the app (on android esp - it had been almost unusable for a while). Keep up the good work & thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working after recent updates. It just keep loading forever. It was slow before, but now simply doesn't work anymore. It takes more than 3 hours to sync and my tags simply don't appear on Android anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow Evernote sucks these days huh? 1 notebook, 50 notes, except I went though and deleted all my notes and notebooks and it still won't let me make any new notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The application is a bit unreliable and slow sometimes, but it works I guess."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quit working on android nearly 3 weeks ago, latest update still hasn't fixed the problem. Provided by work, so I'm not paying for it else I'd delete it entirely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App stuck on ""processing content""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote sucks!! it locked my free account with no notification and wouldn't let me back in without paying (Extortion). I had to pay to get all of my access info for my accounts. go with a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Run while you can. This is very dangerous app if you trust in it. I had more than 4400 notes but with the updates they changed it so much they made it very difficult to use unless you pay. They've also made it much more difficult to export all of your notes. It took 8 hours to get my data exported and still sadly many errors I have to fix. The first bad thing the company did was remove the scrollable list widget and the note export options. What a shame. I use OneNote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"trash app and wont lemme delete my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login into Evernote on more than one device without the application asking me to pay for the subscription! Keep up with your anti-consumer business practices, Bending Spoons. This app was much better before your purchased the company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App performance has degraded significantly. Takes seconds to respond. I fail to understand what kind of bug fixes are made that is causing performance issues. It feels like addition of features is coming at the cost of performance. Been an Evernote user (paid) for 10+ years. I will be looking at Notion as an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"All notes deleted from app and syncing no longer works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Paid user since 2009, and have seen a lot of good and bad with this app. Things finally seem to be heading in the right direction, but the buggy updates are frustrating. One thing gets fixed, and something else breaks. App is still slow to load and to navigate between options (home to notes, as an example), but it's improving slowly. Search is slow and seems to work when it feels like it, which is frustrating when you have a lot of notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"-4 stars for the most intrusive most annoying subscription advertising pop ups in app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absurdly intrusive with ads. Used to be a great app but now it limits your notes and incessantly asks you to pay stupid amounts of money for more space to store TEXT. Edit. Came back to leave another review and forgot this was already here. Want to reiterate how bad this app sucks after I was trying to clean up my 20 notes, and couldn't add new ones without paying a subscription first. Absolute garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ruined by the paywall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"How do I cancel this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"takes time to load..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They get your email and information by claiming that it is free, then they tell you that unfortunately, there is no free currently 😡 Even one star they don't deserve?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am paid user since years. Evernote was such a bful productivity app once. Fast. Efficient. Great CS when required. Then Bending spoons co. took over and ruined it in every possible way. Created clutter, removed many fonts, slowed app, sync issues across devices, I used legacy, then they discontinued legacy too. Demanded double fee (I paid since EN is my 2nd brain, years of data). After months, app still unstable unusable. Lot of emotional trauma. work suffers. Co. unbothered. support missing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This is a brilliant app I use multiple times every day. But the last 12 months, for the first time ever... I'm losing things. New notes don't create properly and get discarded after a hang and restart. I woke early one morning with a big idea, wrote a page of text and lost it all. I thought it would be fixed very fast... But it hasn't been."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There some bug that can even allow one to write a word in a note without freezing constantly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Love the upgrade but boy does it lag 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"4th Aug 24 - Samsung galaxy Note 10+ This app no longer loads. If it starts at all it spends forever and a day trying to analyse the data and then stops at 45%. What is going on? After using for many years now I'm seriously looking at taking the pain in switching to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on my S22Ultra anymore. Does no load. My subscription is gone. Uninstalled and reinstalled, still does not work. Can't access my notebooks and tags. After 6 minutes still not booted up. Sorry I won't be renew my subscription. Sgd. APM.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I literally never leave reviews but evernote has gotten so bad it's earned one. I used to use it for everything but it's become so buggy that even typing a checklist is a nightmare. Stops typing randomly, can only delete, have to close and reopen the note to keep typing. Tried finishing words by clicking on the autocorrect suggestion but instead it just deletes the word. Have to open/close the note at least twice per item in a list and I tried everything I could to fix it. Switching apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally unreliable. Slow and rarely loads notes as it should. (EDIT) This review was left in 2021. August 2024 and still unreliable. Have to constantly clear the cache and storage and re-login for it to bring down existing notes consistently from the cloud."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"how has it even gotten worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great when it was free and you had the option to upgrade. Unlike now, where you have to pay to access your notes and the fees are not reasonable. Not impressed at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this note app before and it was my absolute favorite. In the last 2 years it became a total joke."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot click on a single button, because the stupid popup that says ""I've reached my Limit"", WILL NOT GO AWAY FOR MORE THAN AN ACTUAL SECOND. The second that you close the popup, it immediately pops right back up.... and NEVER STOPS!!! Believe me when I say, don't waste your time downloading this app. There are way better apps out there that won't randomly send out an Update who's sole purpose is ruining your experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First I lost my notes when I was told to unsync my old mobile. Now I'm unable to access anything as I keep being asked to take a subscription. Very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for sudden bursts of inspiration"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update on Aug 2, 2024. After the upgrade I have not managed to access my notes at all. The app just get frozen on the initial white screen and never moves forward. Using this for 12 years and honestly starting to look for alternatives. 2012 -Easy to use, option to have your files offline, I have not gotten app errors whic means is sort of solid, and work just fine in my HTC one.x, laptop and transformer table"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avast there! Nah, me heartie! Mayhaps I should just be usin' me trusty docs to save me notes, arrr! Notes: It seems that Evernote just let anyone use my notebook. I has recently seen some notes written by who-knows-who suddenly appearing in my notebook? There are a bunch of delivery notes asking for payment for a delivery that I didn't even know to who knows where. Not to mention that my device is the only one logging in my account so where in the blaze does those notes comes from?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is nothing but a pop-up simulator. If you want to look at ads and being prompted to pay a monthly fee, then this app (ad) is for you. Use One Note or a piece of paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become a 'ransomware'."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only get this app if you're okay with previously free features being progressively locked behind a ludicrous paywall. I won't be surprised if they start charging per letter typed soon. There are many better— and free!— notepad apps out there, don't waste your time or money here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yeah ... I have 0 interest in being forced into a subscription just to make new notes. I can't even access my old notes because you force a subscription pop up constantly. Time to move my notes elsewhere and uninstall. 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have a problem with the windows app. As I paid customer I wrote them for support. They don't bother to answer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't login it say error try again .i installed and i cant login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need my refund! The app doesn't work fine! I have a planner already, imported it into this evernote, but couldn't use my planner! Couldn't write in it! I tried for almost 24hours! No help from their support either! No useful help on Google also! This is a complete waste of my time and money!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Looks like the app has been fixed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"big fan since inception. good for my ADHD!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really glitchy for past few months. Won't even load most of the time now. Long time user, but I am afraid I am done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to the Reminder tab under Notes? Now I can't see what I have to do for the day! Claimed it's fixed, but it still doesn't sort correctly!! And today, the reminders don't pop up in the phone notifications anymore!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did you know? Evernote turned bad. once a useful note taking app, now an overbulky software thats being unreliable and half the time inaccessible while its ""processing your data"". cant recommend it any longer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best record data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"PLEASE fix this app. It has been my go-to notes app for many years now, and it used to work fine when I had little or no signal. Now it gets caught in an endless loop saying ""We're processing your content"". The updates are making it increasingly unreliable, and unless this improves I will have to move across to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024/08/02: Evernote team screwed it again. Last time I left one star comment was 2019 (see below). The most recent update needs to download my +10000 notes before the app can start which takes forever! Made no sense! I am a long time paying subscriber.. 2019: Very disappointed experience. After the recent update, the app almost always freezes when I opened a note. I have more than 10k notes over the years now I am stuck. The help/support process within the app is not straightforward ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total trash. Cannot use the app or open any of my notes. It keeps prompting me to upgrade to sync unlimited devices, and will not open any of my notes unless I upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great except on android the scratch pad won't scroll down to the bottom far enough to edit later entries. The keyboard covers the bottom and you can't see what your editing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Something is totally wrong with this app now. It won't open unless I uninstall/reinstall then goes through a lengthy checking files process and then won't open again. Rubbish - don't bother with it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is used by thousands of students for notes making. Don't be so money minded that you become hell bent on crippling these students. Have some sense. Don't become vultures."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can no longer open the app. It was recently updated so I'm not sure if that's the problem, but my important information is trapped inside"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid User, Retired. Been using Evernote since 2003. After test driving it for a few years I made it the company-wide do it all app. Worked great till about 3 weeks ago. Now I can't get into Evernote on any Android device. The app is broken, uninstalled and reinstalled twice on each device. Now I can't access it with Firefox, Edge, Safari, or Chrome. When I get back to my office hopefully I can get in on my laptop, it worked last weekend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Newest iteration is annoying. I have lots of notes and got my home screen set up the way I want it. Now they call that ""widgets"" and insist on starting me with a new screen called ""your evernote"" except it isn't mine. It's blank and useless. I can find no way to change it. I wrote to them and of course got no response. ETA: now I can't even log in on the app. Only on the browser. If this isn't fixed soon I am leaving after 12 years plus. The new company only cares about the doubled rates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years and now it is completely inaccessible. When I open the app on my android device, it shows me the Evernote logo and is stuck on that page forever. I feel hopeless that all my notes are lost. Please fix this asap :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need technical support and can never talk to anyone I hate that"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've used Evernote for about 12 years now and would be lost without it. I have used it with my android devices (Samsung Notes and Z-Folds) and synced with my Windows computers seamlessly. It does have a free version, but I pay for the professional version and find it worth every penny. I have never had any issues with it until recently. It's doing strange things when I'm typing as I am updating a note with a list, like a shopping list or to-do list. This is the only reason for 4 stars, not 5."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally unusable now unless you pay them. Pop up every two seconds demanding money can't even see any of my notes. Used to be a really good app now it's trash!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pay pop up. Damn"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app every day for several years. It was a staple in my life. I loved it to the point that it was a point of my identity. For whatever reason. The App will Close and crash upon startup every single time you open the app and make you log back into a webbrowser, which also crashes. Luckily I can still access my notes on a desktop, but the android app is completely ruined."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years. They ruined it. Run, don't walk, away from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not install this app unless you are willing to pay the subscription fee. I'm unable to delete notes, much less access them to copy the information in them prior to deleting them and then uninstalling this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible app now, really sad what the company has done. Just move on to other apps. Update - Can't login anymore and effectively lost all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This literally was my favorite app up until the last 2 or 3 updates. I am no longer able to even open this app. I have uninstalled and tried to reinstall but it won't. 7/11/24 This is the worst update. Every time I try to open the app it stalls. Just spins. I have to uninstall reinstall and then hope that it opens and 9 out of 10 times it just spins or doesn't respond.! It has been the worst 2 days ever. I rely on evernote for so much! I can't access my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well well welllllllllllaaaaaa Evernote I'm sure you are noticing a huge decline in customers a little late but you can change this. A note app is something almost all people use daily and a large part of that is at least weekly but we do not pay huge fees for a note taking app when there are many options that are free. How is 130$ a reasonable compensation for a note taking app I'm not even paying that for my Google.one annually. Is your main goal to sink"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Web client - VERY slow. You can store notes in a browser in IndexedDB - you do no need a client for that. I am on Linux."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"AUGUST 2024 UPDATE: Hey Evernote, how about STOP ASKING ME to buy the freaking subscription! I'm not going to, EVER, and it's not even possible to dismiss the endless popups unless you click ""Remind me later"". Do you know what consent is? No is NO. I've already switched to a different app after a myriad of issues that started happening last year, and my only hope is to slowly migrate everything I created over the years . Not to mention I CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE APP ON MY PHONE anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app won't open, just title page. It just gives me anxiety more often these days. I deleted and reinstalled two weeks ago, updated today, nothing helped. With this app for over 10 years. Premium user. Samsung S22 ultra."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I was complaining that this app is not running but you are not thinking about it. Your service is not correct."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terribly slow. It takes about 8 seconds to create a note in a new notebook, I have the newest Android phone. This is embarrassing. As soon as I can switch to OneNote or literally anything else, I will."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A 10+ year premium user and with the most recent updates, the app has become completely unusable - not somewhat unusable, but completely unusable. It simply won't load the notes. I have had to revert to the web version to access any notes on mobile. I don't understand how they could ""upgrade"" the app only to break it completely!! There was nothing wrong with the last version. Best course of action would be to restore the previous version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't install it if you only want to use the free version. 10 years ago I gave Evernote a 5-star rating. I feel I have to revise my review after this App has gone so badly. It pushes pop-up adds every time when opened, and it freezes very often when I try to search for a note. It's time to leave it. There are so many good alternatives to this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yeah Im out too. Over 10 years. Now I gotta pay $ 129.00 nah nah nah. I knew this would happen one day. Better stick with a google platform or microsoft from now on cause if I find another note program on playstore they just gunna do the same. Once they start charging ya...next step they out of business. And then you lose your data. So thats the next step here. I better be able to capture my stuff before its gone. Jeeze what a waste of time you guys suck"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App won't even go past the splash screen. 🙄🙄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2015, and it was fantastic for years until new management came in. having a 50 note limit on a NOTE TAKING APP is ridiculous, especially considering they've adopted the subscription model instead of one time payments. plus, the constant subscription popups make the app incredibly laggy. I hope the new ownership is happy now that their cash grab of an app has devolved into an unusable, inferior product to everything else on the market."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the recent update, the view that shows all notes with reminders is gone!!! I rely heavily on this feature! Also the app now is very slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Acceptional"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for a number of years to organize information and serve as a peripheral brain. Unfortunately, in the last month it has become more and more unstable and does not open on my Android . It is still available on my PC, which I can't carry around as I used to do with a simpler Evernote. And I'm a premium subscriber! I've reinstalled it several times without success."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good but now the free version is very limited you can only use the free version on one device which is no good to me. And the subscription fees are not value for money. I've only got it on my laptop but will probably drop it completely. Shame, this was once a fantastic app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update 7/31/2024 Now it had been working okay, but slowly but surely it was lagging, and now it won't open st all! And I bought the upgraded version! Guess I'll have to look for another type of app! But all my notes, gone Update 11-10-2022 Now it won't open any of my notes! Like it a whole lot, but suddenly today realized I couldn't print a hard copy of a recipe i saved! Other than that, it is the easiest document keeper! If anyone knows how to print off of a Galaxy Note 5, please let me know!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As stated by everyone else, was a great app, the incessant prompts to upgrade got tiresome and now at this stage I get a ""limit reached"" screen with only 2 options for payment options to upgrade and can no longer access anything in the app unless paid for, would give it 0 if I could."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"slow app. the new design adds more steps to my daily tasks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"E%"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Volta pra atualização antiga"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Highly irritating. Apparently I reached my limit, and then it would not even let me delete some stuff to reclaim the free space. Compulsory to buy the plans??? Ridiculous!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app worked fine, used it for years. But eventually they picked up a subscription model and now the app is absolutely full of pop ups trying to get you to subscribe. Not to mention that the cost of the subscription is insane for something that should essentially be a basic app shipped with the phone. Try Keep Notes instead. It's free and it won't harass you constantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been on the Personal paid plan for over a year and honestly? They've got to step it up or I'm going to have to cancel it. The mobile app is frustratingly slow and frequently forgets things that I'm actively typing, and the desktop app is severely lacking in customization and clunky to use. I like having a cross-platform note taking app but often times I've found myself using the built-in Samsung notes app instead just because it's that much quicker."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow this app sucks now. Been a long-time user since 2016 and the usability since then has completely deteriorated. I'm annoyed by the constant prompts to upgrade, the interface, the notebooks limit, the devices limit. Big L. I'm out as soon as I can salvage all my notes and transfer them to a new app. BYE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Man this program F'n sucks since the update (think 2 updates ago +-). It is SUPER SUPER SLOW. The lag when ticking a box and waiting for the writing to ""activate"" is ridiculous!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND This guys are limiting features I'm using for couple of years. They seriosly gave us something, and now you have to pay to remain what you had for free. Sudenly I cant add new notes (so I had to restore old notes from trash and rewrite them), or I have to sign out from one device, even I was using this app on 2 devices FOR YEARS! Devs, what are you thinking? Spamming ALL THE TIME and not alowing what I allready had. I have to move to competition. I DO NOT RECOMMEND"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great to have on hand for shopping lists, writing or reminders"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App doesnt work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now it seems like they are pushing user to subscribe and pay them. I would like to say thank you for this 10 years. About to uninstall. Time to say bye-bye sayonara adieu adios arrivederci adeus dos svidaniya tschuss"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bending spoons is bending the elephant beyond it can stretch. Seriously, you are killing the ever green ,ever great - Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is fantastic, but i have a concern. With free version, it allows Max 50 notes which is fine. But it also counts the deleted notes under this limit of 50 notes and doesn't allow creation of new note after deleting the notes and emptying the trash. The count needs to reduce if the notes are deleted and trash emptied. Kindly check please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Web version loads rather than android version. Uninstall /reinstall does not fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Seems like they have fixed the issues with the last update. Everything working normally. Handy app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit notes to 50 for free absolutely bonkers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am using this app since 2015 But currently I am facing many issues. I can't create a new not, the app is just closed suddenly every time I will try to create a new note!!! What I have to do??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't what has happened to the developers, they now made it slow , bulk unresponsive... Not even open smoothly when you start the app.. totally disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WAS Always my go-to, now I'm done. New changes make this app unusable for me. The benefits are gone. Started using it in 2011, but now I can't create new notes, because as a free account, you can only have 50 notes TOTAL, and I have over 1000, from the past decade. Today, I discovered that now you can only sync ONE device. Guess that means it's time to uninstall the app and only use it on the web until I find something better. Way to go Bending Spoons on killing it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app for many, many years. For some reason, the android app recently decided to start doing this loading thing where a percentage number starts loading on the screen and then it never finishes. I've had to uninstall and reinstall 4 times in the last week. Update 7/30/24: so it happens when the app attempts to optimize itself. It'll give me a warning saying that next time the app opens, it will optimize and then gets stuck in the process."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Some years ago it was a good app but now it's just awful, please do not install it and do not ever try it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A great app to keep all your files safe and secure across your devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Its very good app. Can do more than just notes...please help to fix my issue. evernote is not opening in my pixel 6a running Android 15 beta. thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I would greatly appreciate it to be able to copy all my data so I can download it from this app. I want to be allowed or directed on how I can copy all my data so it can download from EverNote. I have been a long time user of this app, and I’m exhausted with all of the deficiencies. With each update more and more is taken away and harder to open with great wait time, and cost has risen too high. The latest version, Format doesn’t paste into Word, and there still is no mass export capability MS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"July 2024 Mobile app doesn't load. 25 minutes, still waiting. I'm a paid subscriber. Most useful to grab or store information on the go. I love that it is accessible on my computer as well. The new UI makes it even better and easier to record what's going on in my life / head."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"If you don't know your password you lose your notes which cost me a lot one day my password wouldn't work and I lost all my notes. I tried everything. There is no support for the free version so I lost hundreds of notes. And then when I had the program some of my notes were missing. Beware. The ability to pull up the same nodes in my laptop phone and computer was excellent . I wasn't the only one though I knew someone who lost half of their photos. A friend of mine who I recommended the program"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a long time. But now with the new upgrade I can't see my notes because they forced me to pay! They don't even give me a chance to even screen capture my notes so I HAVE TO subscribe to copy my notes. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to cancel the pop up prompt for paid version option. Have to delete it since it's become problematic and unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm a long time user of Evernote app. For me the most important quality was ability to quickly make a few notes. The latest app iteration has become sluggish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user for more than 10 years, in the beginning I was hopeful that the service would continue to improve, to support this I became a paying user. But over time the service and app continued to get worse and worse, with multiple downgrades of functionality after updates. And now with the new paywall they've put up I feel I'm being pushed into a corner. I feel forced to move to Notion even though I would prefer to stay within a functional Evernote ecosystem. Find another place for your notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I thought if you use less than 5G space this app is for free, been using it like that for few years but now it ask me for payment. Sorry I am out it's not free any more. Sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app sucks. super expensive and just crashes all the time. didn't waste your money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly one of the worst app. Now that I have a lot of notes in that, I find it difficult to go out of it. The app keeps popping up with the premium version, without a close button. And for every note clicked, there is a pop up, which takes a lot of time to close. And, even when the screen rotation is off, this genius app rotates the screen in a slight tilt. If I wanted it, I'd switch on screen rotation genius. Just need to find time to migrate to other notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hi sir What a pathetic decision i have taken by taking subscription of your application Evernote. This pathetic app is repeatedly crashing. I am not able to use my reminders and notes. I will not advocate this pathetic app to anyone. Kindly fix the problem or refund my subscription amount. I am not at all inclined to continue with this slow and repeatedly crashing application. Thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been user since its launch and the recent updates force me to keep Just 1 device and cannot even use Evernote Web as a normal user. Too stringy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app for so long I lost count after 10 years. I've stuck around after every price increase, and have seen the app deteriorate over time. Now it's become impossible to open the app on my phone. I can't believe it but I may actually finally switch to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"another interface redesign. cannot find my shortcuts. thanks for nothing, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Excellent but also extremely slow. It takes a few seconds to carry out basic functions like opening up a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I am updating a scathing review because recent years saw a decline in free features and the app went from a beautiful simple functional app to an expensive clunky problematic app. I hoped upgrading to the paid account would improve things, then for a bit I couldn't get my data at all through the phone or pc apps and customer service is well, let's be nice and call them very busy and not terribly responsive. The app seems to be recapturing is prior beauty and functionality. STOP CHANGING IT!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having a problem with evernote. The latest update for note 10+ is not opening. Just goes to a blank white screen. Could you actually debug it before sending it out. I pay for this app and use it daily for work. This needs to be fixed soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app won't load on my Android anymore. Although they have added many new features, it has become slower and slower, close to the point of becoming useless. I don't need a notes app that takes so long to pop up. I'm a long time user and I'm hoping for the best, but for the time being, I have been forced to use other apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is awful!! I have been a long-time user of Evernote and IAM DONE!! Part of the reason I kept and PAID for this was how easy it was to use on my phone. No more after the last update! I can't even get in!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great tool. People complain because of the pay wall, but it's not a charity. If you want more notes, you have to pay. Deal with it. It's not that expensive. I highly recommend the app to those who have positions where you need to be very organized and have it all in one place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is one app that I use every day, and I don't want to live without it. I recommend it often."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for almost a decade and it used to be amazing even without paying for it, and then it started getting really buggy. Out of nowhere, it wouldn't let me make any new notes without paying for it and I had a 20 note limit. This was so sudden and unexpected that it made me want to change right there. I did end up paying for it and have stuck with it, but it has still been so buggy. I can't make or edit a note with check boxes, it won't save notes, etc. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is not working even I can't login or sign in app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid user: app is terrible/ awful/waste of time these days (July 2024) 5+ years user, app WAS great, then the company was sold and I have no idea what the new management is doing of for what however the functionality went to the drain. I had to uninstall and reinstall no less than 20 times IN THE LAST 2x days just to be able to see MY OWN NOTES."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They update it twice a week and make it not work each time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has always been problematic. Sharing files, searching for files, etc. and now with the lastest update it won't update at all. (July 29, 2024) The best part?? You can't use the MOBILE WEBSITE anymore, they force redirect you to the app that won't load. That is a garbage user experience. Do better. And on top of that it now costs over $100 a year... for desktop use only at this point. Bye Evernote, you used to be awesome."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free “version” went overnight from usable with limits to unusable with nothing but paywalls. Won't even load my existing work, anymore. Frustrating that I stored some journaling and address resources here. To think I used to consider the paid version! But there are other apps that haven't abused my trust."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great for taking notes, will not stop bothering me with ads about premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this but ever since it's been owned by Bending Spoons, it's become nothing but a cash grab. Now I can't even access my existing notes because the pop up screen for a monthly / yearly subscription keeps appearing. Evernote is holding MY intellectual data to ransom. This is illegal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Expensive. Especially with so many free alternatives. Unusable thanks to forcing Premium on you. You can't really do anything without being annoyed to get premium. Has become pretty unusable. Have to switch to another app after 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is garbage. RIDICULOUS subscription price. And deleteing my account was the most frustrating experience I've had in the last 6 months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been a paying customer for many years, but the app has been going downhill since Bending Spoons bought it. It requires a lengthy update every time I open it. When it finally loads, often the interface has dramatically changed, or my shortcuts have disappeared, or there is some other glitch. I don't know how much longer I can justify paying for Evernote, especially with the hefty price increase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep pushing you to upgrade to the paid version, which allows more than 50 notes. I dont need that many, so I keep rejecting the offer. Now, every day and without my approval, they are automatically adding new note templates onto my notepad, pushing me to the 50 limit. I keep deleting, only for them to add more. I cant find a setting to deactivate this, and Ive sent messages to their help centre asking them to stop, but no response. Download another app and save yourself the frustration."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the last update, the app won't start. It stuck at the splash screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10 years plus user, the app has become unusable, won't ever finish loading... what a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the most recent update, the app doesn't even open at all. Useless. Not worth my money anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now its just feels bad to use.. Wait!!! you cant even use now lol 😂"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"12yr customer. now having endless issues following update, with slow performance on multiple devices that persist following reinstall. these things happen BUT NO RESPONSE from customer service is not acceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your pop ups are completely ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Helps me stay organized with tasks and notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for several years now and use it for my daily not taking, but I'm not really liking the new app update. Please bring back having the option to have the widget screen as the main screen again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app became painfully slow. It's unusable now. It is 2024, and I still can't get past login screen. Wow!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There was not a single notification of informing the user that it has some limit and now without subscription I can't even download or look at the notes I made. Very well scheme.🥲"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since the constant paywalls this app has become increasingly unuseable. Now I can't even log in on my phone. Plenty of other note taking apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a paid user for many many years. Used to love it. Now, it's so full of bugs, slow, and wont even open on my phone. You guys screwed up a really great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use it everyday for poems, outlines, sermon notes. it's a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Instead of spending money on making ads in social media spend on some good engineering. This app should be seamless but it's not at all resposive. Apps like obsidian are super fast but thing lags like hell"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreasonable pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the best app My virtual companion from almost 15 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has signed me out all devices at once. When I try to resign in, it claim I to many devices and that I need to disconnect on. However, because I have been signed out of all devices I have reached my new device limit quota and now it wants me to pay. Essentially Evernote is holding my work hostage, it's an average app. I refuse to pay for this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"latest update has hung up the app multiple times and I've had to delete data each time to get it back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WTH happened!? How is there a full paywall for the same basic note storage I've been using for ages?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 device sync limit is so ridiculousl"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After 12 years of great use, I have to say the app has gotten worse. I still use Evernote but only because I have not found a suitable replacement yet. Sad to see it digress, I loved this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The idea is great but functionality is not worth the subscription price. Sharing notes across devices is great and convinient but this app will discard changes about 10 keystrokes into what I'm typing half the time I try to edit something in my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Removed the two devices limit, that was the reason for having it 🤦"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app constantly crashes, and now gives me an error when I try to log in. Trying to contact customer service about the problems just sends me back to the broken app. How irresponsible not to have a way for customers to contact customer service when the app is not working. What am I paying for?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I switched everything over to Evernote and paid for the premium subscription this last year. It hasn't worked for weeks. I can't create notes. My job is getting screwed up because I lost all of my notes going back to March. This is costing me money. This app does not work. Do not use Evernote. I want a refund."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NEW EDIT No way that you cannot press anything before being prompted ONE HUNDRED TIMES to pay. Unbelievable! Better delete all old users data and terminate the app, its impossible! EDIT! Sorry but that turned to a proper ""We want your money app"" Constant pay pop ups, can't record notes and tasks anymore, just pay pay pay! Don't bother to install! Useless. Helpful app, using it for years. Repaired and with less ads. Thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tired of constant pop up subscription notices. Not worth $15/month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for many years but now, once you reach their limit, they lock you out with a popup for pay service. You are unable to retrieve your stored notes, etc! They should at least have allowed retrieval of your stored info. I had things in there that I'll never remeber that were very important. Thanks Evernote for holding everyone hostage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but now the Android app is very very buggy. Sadly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was told there would be a seven day trial. I cancelled before my seven days and was still charged. I attempted to contact them through email and never heard back from them. This app does the same as Google keeps which is free. I would like my money refunded."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Getting worse and worse. Works ok to keep articles while doing research, but otherwise is a waste of money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using Evernote since 2010 and it continues to be awesome! (2024 now)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to open the app anymore. Just stuck on the launch screen. God knows why have you guys ruined the most loved notes app!! I am an active subscriber, what do I do now??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Voltei a pagar recentemente o app. Algumas mudanças me agradaram muito, velocidade está muito boa, mas ainda há alguns bugs dentro do android de fluidez e touch. No entanto, vejo que o app está seguindo o caminho certo, a questão é não deixar essa simplicidade de captura de lado que é o pilar central e o que me permite tomar notas e capturar coisas rapidamente, mas também não ter medo de inovar e adicionar novos recursos, nem que isso pareça ser uma copia de recursos de outros apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app performance!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I will pay for my notes, but after that, i dont want Evernote with the rights over me. Where is the support for this app? Evernote has blocked my files, years of publishing data, is now asking for payment. Isn't that extortion?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This latest version keeps crashing! 😡😡😡 Each successive update has been a hit-or-miss, you never know what you're going to get...sometimes a stable app, and sometimes not! What is certain is the uncertainty of the stability of each update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have been using Evernote since 2013 and have been using the paid version the last few years, however whenever they've updated and use Bending Spoons it's insanely slow, sometimes it doesn't react at all when you try to open a note and has severely gone downhill in how efficient it used to run. I'm definitely bummed because I'm pretty committed to still using it but it isn't how it used to be at all, pretty glitchy and super slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened? After years of seamless availability, now cannot get online with the mobile app. Contacted customer support and got the run around. Looking at moving to OneNote now. Can't afford to lose access to my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incredibly buggy. Sometimes won't open at all. Can't believe I'm paying $100+/yr for this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"evernote was great when it was an upstart company solving problems now they just milk there clientbase for over priced features looking to switch soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The App won't even open anymore!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working, asking for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite app (love making lists) and I would have paid a reasonable amount to keep using it. But their new pricing is preposterous and their constant pop-ups to try to get you to move to paid membership are so annoying, so now I am moving my notes and will dump Evernote. So sad, I used it for 15+ years. And today (July 2024) I was forced to unsync a device, even though I only use it on my phone & occasionally the web view (which I haven't used in a year at least)! AWFUL APP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't make a note on a blank page with no keyboard. EDIT: If you don't plan to improve the mobile app's, function, you should probably tell the consumer that you intend for them to work by desktop only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Couldn't live without it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote sucks. I use the free version and now that I've used up all the notes allowed on the free version, whenever I try to enter the app to see existing notes, pop ups completely obstruct the entire app so I cannot access anything. It's basically holding my notes hostage unless I pay R99. per month. Not cool. Dont go for it unless you're going for the pay version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"😀"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Not for beginner"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute joke now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not usable anymore. It was a great application back in the days. Cannot unsymch devices bug - what a way to push for subscription...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They hijacked my information behind a paywall... I used this for years suddenly it started to demand payment for me to see my information. I cant even delete it .."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app UPDATE: I paid for this app originally about 11, or so years ago. Now I can't use it because it says I'm at my limit. I have many notes that I can't access anymore, why must I pay again?? I will likely pay for a month and copy my notes to someplace else in the very near future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I won't waste my time to write a review for this scrap. Only one word, Pathetic!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great platform across android and iOs ecosystem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Prohibitively expensive. 🤯"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trickery. I do NOT recommend. I stopped using this app when I reached my limit using it free, because I didn't like it enough to pay for it. I switched to another I liked better plus was better value for money. This app is now forcing me to buy a subscription, at least a month @ €12.99 just to retrieve my info. Of course they need revenue, but holding my own data to ransom is unethical. Zero stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why the hell u started to charge.. it's like a force...you r not at all giving something special all note pad r free.. super dislike for this behavior."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really pathetic... The app doesn't open only.. Used this app for so many years and only for the last few weeks facing issue every now and then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last update has locked me out of my free notes. And will only open a screen to set up for a yearly or monthly payment for the Non Free Evernote. I was thrilled to use Evernote, but alas it might be time to move on if I'm being forced to get a monthly/yearly plan on the Free copy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"crashed... couldn't open it on my samsung S22+ even after the update. had to uninstall and reinstall it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love this app. Make tasks available on Wear OS and I will go Pro and give a 5 star review. I need tasks, reminders and repeat events for my watch. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Evernote now charges you to access your account on two devices, because you need the internet to reconnect to one device, and this counts as a device in itself!! FIX THIS, EVERNOTE, OR YOU'LL LOSE CUSTOMERS!! The app will not open at all, with fingerprint as well as PIN. I get a white screen, and I've cleared my cache twice and rebooted my phone. No luck. I will change my rating if developer reactivates PINs and biometrics, as this is why I chose the app in the first place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love the ability to use it cross platform and tidy up bullet points. Utilizing A.I. feature got me feeling productive!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Love this app and now am a premium subscriber HOWEVER... recently I've started getting this really annoying bug where it will just log me out and won't let me log back in. It just says ""Please contact support"" and when I go to Support there isn't actually a way to directly contact Evernote. Only to post on their forum, but to do so, you need to login. So when I try to post it just sends me back to app and I can't log in and I'm in a hell spiral of login doom. Please suggest ways to fix this :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was very good, but suddenly, it started blackmailing and stopped working and forced to drop a device and refused to work without payment. Instead of subscription, they should give a one-time purchase option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant app bugs (crashing, rotating when autorotate is turned off, stuck in landscape mode etc), popups telling you to pay for subscription at least three times when using the app for a few minutes, and now you only get 1 synced device (making this app useless) Never using this greedy, broken, useless app again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 7/25/2024 - Evernote gets worse with every update and now they are charging paying customers even more. It's completely useless on my phone now. The app won't even open 90% of the time. I'm switching to something else. Update 4/23/2021 - Evernote just keeps getting worse. I'm a paying subscriber and now they're trying to get me to pay even more for useless backgrounds. Why are they so set on ruining this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pretty much useless now that it's only up to 50 notes for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They let you use the app for free but then finally you must subscribe and you don't even get a final access to your notes that you've been building up. Like ransom-ware if you ask me. There should be a warning or something. They made it out to seem free but then they do this. Shame on Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After new owners acquired its getting worse and worse every month. I was a user for last 10 years, but now I will be switching to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would not use, racket that borders extortion. After using it for a period of time I was locked out of my notes saying to many devices connected. There was only once device connected. Completely locked out of my notes until I pay for subscription to either remove a device(there is only one) or have more devices. Deleted and moved on to better free apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why doesn't the app even open anymore? I have been a long time user and no more! Super disappointed in this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many nagging screens to upgrade and 'special offer discount' pop-ups. Evernote used to be a solid note taking app, it's now irritating to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used Evernote since 2014 and loved it. Was paying customer. Recommended it a lot. But since 2022, it's buggy and useless for various reasons. Since 2024, can't even open the app. The last update didn't fix the issue either. Installed Notion and loving it. Bye bye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It pop ads into your face everytime you use it, and now you can only use 1 device at a time instead of 2 or 3 devices and website like before Yet the application still laggy as ever on Android, even with that much money begging slap into your face"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Requires internet access even if all I'm trying to use is the checklist on my smartwatch. Unless, of course, I'm a paying user, in which case the requirement is waived."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"mind blowing App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total Failure on OS Andriod (11) Installs and crashes EACH time you open it Been a paid customer since 2016 Used to be awesome company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps hanging...I'll soon migrate to other app... awful awful service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app to take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing...please look into it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's become very buggy. So many updates that stall the app. I've had to uninstall and reinstall several times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The Evernote app has proven very useful over the years. Notes, records, and lists are easily synced and shared between my wife and myself on our mobile phones and laptops."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you are on free plan, it will spam you with option to upgrade every you open the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app since 2018. I have a few notes that I access and add to maybe once every month or two. Latest update broke everything! I cannot access my notes because of the constant money begging. As soon as I click the x to close the begging, it pops up again. Just now.. I've been trying to access one note and I have not been able to. That's the whole reason I'm here writing this! I've closed the request to upgrade 18 times so far, and I still haven't accessed my note. Don't bother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"sensacional!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used the free version for years and suddenly can't use 2 devices anymore on the free plan. I think it's unethical to lure people in and let them get used to certain free features and then start asking money for those features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Love this app. Love that it has a passcode. I use it on my android Downloaded it to my windows laptop. Gave this app 4 starts Reason for that is, I can not set a pass code on windows like on my andrpid. I use this app for journaling my feelings. Family has access to my laptop. I had to uninstall this app from my laptop as it is not private enough. Evernote should look into option for pass code on laptop as an option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"As of July 2024: The new app update is horrendous. It used to be so user friendly... the app is extremely glitchy, it's not loading notes and it's also showing I am missing one of my notebooks. Absolutely ridiculous. Also, I am a paying customer which allows to write indefinitely in your note. The app didn't allow me to do that so I had to take my laptop at work to be able to edit notes while I was walking around. Used to love Evernote and now with every update I hate it. Stuck with it for now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No stars 7/24/2024 update, app stopped functioning had to uninstall it. 5 stars 2015 Helps to keep your information organized. I use it all the time. You can access everything on your phone and PC."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother with a 3rd party Notes app, especially this one. Just go for something Google or Apple supported. Evernote will not last forever. I used the app for ~7 years and when I switched over to a new phone they deleted everything I ever wrote and told me it was because I didn't update the app (I did). After a month of tech support I was tricked by a dishonest $15/month paywall to get my ""maxed out"" data back, only to find it still empty. 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$97/year and have not been able to fin any saved note. Tired of the ""NOTE UNAVAILABLE"" not renewing this anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having been with Evernote nearly 10 years. I did pay for one year but endless bags to upgrade further . 7 2024 I TRY TO LOGIN AND I FIND ALL MY DATA GONE , I CANT LOGIN . THE NEW MANAGEMENT NOT INTERESTED IN FREE ACCOUNTS. DIRTY PLAY FROM EVERNOTE I SUSPECT"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Every update causes a break where it won't load. You have to uninstall, restart, and install again to fix. EDIT: Today's update was successful, adding a star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I LOVED this app, I've used it for nearly a decade. After ads starting popping up every time I opened the app or tried to make a note, I started to get annoyed but kept using because I had so many important notes saved. Now they've made it so after a short free trial you have to pay, so I un-installed. I love this app, but life is expensive enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update rolled our Friday and now when I start the app it opens to a picture of a green elephant and sits there for hours. There's no way to access my notes! Tried deleting data, and even reinstalling the app. It works fine for a minute or so when I reinstall, and back to green elephant. Re-open, and directly to the green elephant. Over a decade of notes are unavailable. I filed a support request with my logs and haven't received a response from Evernote in days. Wow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I now have to pay to sync notes across multiple devices, and will have to stop using Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Startet nicht mehr, bleibt beim Starten bei ""Share Logs"" hängen. Und ich Depp zahle auch noch dafür"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it doesn't allow me to use it all of sudden. Add keep popping up asking to pay. Pity as it was nice product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very poor user experience when offline, even with synced notebooks; regularly throws errors. when online, notes edited sequentially in both the mobile app and the web app lose content."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just received an email saying they're almost DOUBLING the already atrocious cheapest subscription plan price from $69/year to $120/year! Absolute highway robbery! What a ridiculous increase for an app that is getting nothing but 1 star reviews! Goodbye Evernote! Microsoft OneNote is easy to use and at $99/year you get all MS Office apps and 1TB storage! I've copied all my notes over to OneNote and cancelled my Evernote subscription. Enjoy all your 1-star reviews!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very handy (2012). The android version 10.91.0, hangs at 95% when I open it. I'm running Android 14 on a Pixel Pro 7. I have to keep un- and re- installing it to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unless you have a paid version, you're just wasting your time in it. Every update they make it worse. Now you can't even use the app, so if you were earlier free user with data now you can't even access it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fantastic app in 2014, a lot of questionable monetization choices have led to bloat in functionality with heavy pressure to subscribe resulting in longtime users no longer being able to continue to use the app without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Already a sub-par app that keeps removing features for free users and making the app not only worse, but makes me less likely to even consider a premium subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my reviews 1 star. It has a lot of security issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they are charging me $130 a year to use the app, but it takes 5 minutes to open. The web app is constantly unusable and just spins when you try and login. If I wasn't so dependent on the content I store in the service, I wouldn't have renewed at all. By renewal next year, I plan to be on something else that I can actually make consistent use of when I need my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"note taking is good and has enough features to organise things well enough. However, the free tier is limiting and using the app is totally ruined by the constant 'limited time offer' to upgrade to a sub. I'm spammed every time I want to open the app to check a note. And it's not simple to just say no. They're now trying to trick people in to signing up to a free trial of premium with the design of the popup... the trial auto renews of course. And now the free tier only allows 1 device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App isn't allowing me to use for free anymore. I have been using this app for years without issues! It is extremely frustrating that I use the basic service and they want to charge me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years. It is my go-to note app. Unfortunately it isn't that great anymore. The yearly costs of 99 euros for a premium account just to take notes is absurd.. I don't mind to pay a bit for a great app but the app is slow on android and has flaws. To pay this amount just to make it work acros devices is insane.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loading.... Loading.... Loading.... And then trouble loading. WHY U CHANGED, EVERNOTE? WHYYY??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what I need it to do. Great app. If you want to get organised and you are ""the librarian"" type who loves to collect hundreds of notes then this is the app for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am suffering to login my account , error show"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App not working anymore. Have tried reinstalling. Keeps crashing. Am a paid subscriber."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated to latest version and app logged me out.. (I hate it when the devs force it... Should be able to update app without losing the session) As if that wasn't bad enough, the app says there is already an account linked and doesn't let me use it, throwing an unactionable error message. Next to that, starting the login process again the app form just becomes stuck in a death loop. Very poor user experience!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app... Now it has been a while since I last used it. It keeps crashing and some of my notes just simply disappeared from the app. I am a paid subscriber and I am seriously considering cancelling it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been user of Evernote since 2014, it's been almost 10 years!! In this years of usage I found it very handy to save my notes and some important data. But from the last year Evernote has gone barbaric forcing the users to go premium, it has even removed the access to mobile platform unless and untill you upgrade. As Evernote replacement I have found ""Zoho Notebook"" another added advantage is that you can migrate all the data(Notes) needed from Evernote to Zoho Notebook which a simple click."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"app not getting installed on my device, after 99% . tried 5 times"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app about 12-15 years. It's shameful what has been done with this simple app that was so useful. The developers made this once wonderful app now overly complex for a whole different user base and is trying to charge way more than it would ever be reasonable to pay. Plenty of other options I will be leaving for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update on Monday 7/22/24. Wow, it now creates two blank notes for every new note you create. Back on 7/7/24 it was creating one extra blank note. I guess that fixing bugs is not a high priority."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot load app on android after awhile. Worst paid app experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After getting progressively worse over time it now no longer even opens after the latest update. Just hangs. What a shame, a good product was run into the ground over time. There is now no incentive to keep using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Premium user for over 13 years. The past two weeks have been a nightmare on Android. It started by signing me out, then it found my account on my phone to log in. Error logging in. Cannot log in. Had to uninstall the app, and reinstall. Then could log in. After the 3rd time of this repeated issue I told it to stop auto-update. Just again today I ran into being logged out again and I'm getting an error. Need to reinstall again. It used to work - why did you break it? About to get a refund & leave"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gold is cheaper than your note taking app..I'd better write notes on my palm"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great application for taking rich notes. But the ever rising price is a kicker !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Google play does not show my account subscribes Evernote's service. Evernote automatically charged for monthly fee without my confirmation since 2023. The payment uses my paypal account where paypal never raises any warning. I tried to cancel any service I never confirmed to subscribe, using either Evernote APP or its web site. However, some subscription page always pop out and blocked me using any functions. It is ridiculous that Evernote already charged monthly fee but still blocked usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"slow bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it crashes often I can't open from my phone and I have the paid version . if it wasn't for that, I love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's slow, every time you open it's asks you to go paid, which is anoying, when you are in a hurry to take notes stops you w the anoying pop up to upgrade, so I'm switching, there are plenty of note taking apps, good bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: I have been using this app for over a decade and I think it's time to move on. When they changed ownership this app became trash. The desktop version is still decent, but the mobile app is the worst. I would use this app for class notes, grocery lists, ideas for books, and more. Now. it takes 2 mins to open which might not seem like a long time, but if you are a writer and want to capture an idea before it's gone forever, this app is not for you. The saddest thing is that I paid for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's good that we hv, audio, document,scan, capture picture options. But the app is very slow in processing the information or the tasks we assign...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"poor and confusing navigation unreliable search App has become more buggy since they forced users to start paying for more than 50 notes annually. weird, I thought you should receive better quality when you start paying, apparently not."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even with the device orientation being locked, app consistently auto-rotates. Taking notes at night has been a pain since as I cannot lay down. No way to turn it off and apparently this problem has been an issue since 2022, didn't even realize that why I stop almost ALL use of the app until today I TRIED to fix it and found out after 2 years of app users complaining there's still no fix..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be such a good and useful app but now it is all geared around trying to get you to subscribe to a monthly payment plan. Not fit for purpose anymore as every time you click on something a pop up blocks your screen trying to force you into signing up for a paid subscription. There are many other apps that are free as all I want to do is keep a few notes handy I will use the phones pre loaded apps in future"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely poor handwriting capability . Android tablet's app version (S9) kept on crashing ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I installed this app yesterday, but I have not been able to open it until now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the hell?Get it together evernote! The app is now a blk space with a green elephant & says made with 🤍 by bending spoons! All the recent 1 star reviews is what I'm curently experiencing. & you're making us pay for this torture? Fix it fast or I smell class action!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"You guys have deleted several of my notes that are very important. Please fix!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user.... I'm out. I've used this app and it's sister software (then later website) on computers for more than a decade. I'm done. The recent updates make the app beg you for money every time you open it, and several more times in the middle of typing your note. Then they limited the number of notes you can keep on the free version. If I had ANY faith the paid version would be good I might consider it, but it also crashes and glitches like crazy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucks. So buggy keeps deleting my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user; both phone and PC version get more bloated and slower with time; while was a very quality app few years ago its gotten more bloated, with constant PC updates and downloads that massively HOG system resorces. Would not recommend at this time, and planning to switch to another service in due time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"the fees are too high . I can do the Samethung with other apps for half the cost. so notvrenewing. used this app since its inception."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It worked great for years but now I get a blank screen when I put in my password."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nothing worth paying for so don't bother"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for a few years and loved it at first, but the last year or two it has really gone downhill. Evernote, please stop updating your app. I'm on a Galaxy S10, been using it for years, and finally have to uninstall/reinstall to get it to maybe work. Opening takes forever, navigating notebooks takes forever. Please stop making ""improvements"" and make it stable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand needing to ask for a premium account but asking everytime a open a new note is very annoying. I will be moving my info off this and just using my phone notes and email myself notes i need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's wrong with Evernote? I'm a paid user and eversince the latest update I can't use my Evernote on Android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will be deleting this app. I've had it for a long and today I couldn't reach important information because a paywall kept popping up. Had to pay the month to get my info out of this nightmare of an app. Do NOT download."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I agree with some of the other reviewers I have had it! I haven't been able to print for the longest time on my Samsung Galaxy ultra 22. It gets worse with every update and now the app won't even open on my phone. I was billed over $140 for my annual payment last time. I am canceling and hopefully getting a refund. As much as it pains me to say, MS OneNote is much much better. Very interesting I used MS OneNote over a decade ago, it became unusable and I moved to Evernote, now moving back! Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A user since almost 10 years. I'm switching to someting else. All these constant updates over the last couple of years did nothing but ruin the interface and slow everything down. Endless issues with syncing and freezing... The product and dev teams made the app practically unusable and a bloated mess. Shame :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now, you can't even open the app. It just sits at the front page, with the green elephant and ""Bending Spoons"" logo. A joke of a company! It was bad enough that Evernote suddenly wanted $120+ for just writing notes when that same service is offered for free all over the web. I can't access old notes I had on this app from before it turned to sh**."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Who wants to spend 1000s of rupees for notes?every second 1 pop up for that as if we are so unsure and just one more pop up and we will definitely buy it. Utterly disgusting.0 star would have been a justice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App won't open on my phone anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a premium subscriber & have used this app for well over 10 years. It used to be one of my go-to apps that I highly valued & recommended to many. Unfortunately, since it's been rebranded (sold?) it's become a shadow of its former self. Each update seems worse than the previous one, and the latest one won't even load at all! Luckily, it hasn't upgraded on all of my devices and I've started the process of exporting my data with a view of moving to a more reliable solution. It's a sad day 🙁"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The 50 note limit is rubbish, there are many free apps that do just as well as the overpriced paid version as well. I've used Evernote for personal and business for at least 4 years and have no interest in keeping it. I have paid in the past as well but would never again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before I could even make my first note the app said my limit has been reached and asks me to pay. Can't even close the pay window to see anything."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps stopping and give white screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know why I waited so long to try Evernote... what a useful and amazing app! *EDIT 7/19/2024* The new updates / patch have been a disaster. I relied on Evernote to organize my notes between my Android phone & PC - notes for work, notes for personal projects, even things as mundane as a grocery list or books for my kid. I can't access any of it on phone anymore, the app crashes and refuses to load. I'm a paid subscriber too - but I'll be canceling my subscription unless its fixed ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years and now it won't work on my android. I tried uninstalling to reinstall, but google play store won't even download the app anymore. I'm very disappointed all my notes are lost. I'd give this app 0 stars if possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They ruined it. I used this for 12+ years, loved it! Now that I'm 8 years in, they switched from $35/y to $130/y.... and I have no choice but to subscribe because I have 8 years of data saved... this is so disgraceful to long time supporters of their app. It's a great app, truly. They get 1 star for how they are treating thier long time users... and a second star because I still love the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant prompts asking to get a paid plan is the reason I stopped using Evernote. I've been using them for years but these prompts every single time has made this app unusable and inefficient. I switched to the free google keep."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 19.7.24 Now most of my notes cannot open after having used this app for years. Unbelievable! Don't download! Been using this app for years but the latest ""upgrade"" has turned it into a useless app. It is so slow to open and takes ages to find my notes. Now suddenly it does not open and I probably have to reinstall. I will be looking for an alternative. Update 6.6.23 Now notes take ages to open. Even 1 line notes take over a minute to open. I just get the spinning wheel. Waste of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All content created earlier than this year has disappeared. Don't put anything critical in this POS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app. Now when I search, could not load the note on my android phone.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be better than other apps, but now the app drastically degraded! 1. Once I launched it, it began bombarding me with adds and popups. Imagine wanting to take a quick note and getting overwhelmed by these annoying distractions! 2. The app became extremely slow. I have to wait 5 seconds after tapping an empty (!) note for it to completely open. Other apps perform a similar task in milliseconds. Deleting the app. Based on other reviews, I'm not the only one to notice these issues."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bugs bugs bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Odié la experiencia"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"använde i 6 månader utan problem men en dag skulle den uppdatera och sedan kunde jag inte logga in. Sedan kom jag in på mitt konto på datorn men nästa alla mina notes var borta. Jag har försökt hitta kontaktinfo för att få tillbaka mina notes eftersom jag litade på appen och det fanns flera notes som jag verkligen inte vill förlora. Men har inte någon kundtjänst alls. Rekomenderar INTE. Gör inte om mitt misstag."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is down again. i am unable to reach anyone at EN for support. $120/year for this BS. Hopeless!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Opted for the free version. Was fine as long as you stayed below 50 notes (could freely delete and create as many new notes as long as total was below 50). Accidentally hit 50 one day and even after deleting 20 notes I couldn't create any new notes as well as a new pop up with 4 screens you have to click though to deny the paid version upgrade each time you open the app and also each note. That's 8 pop-ups total before you even get into your first note you opened the app for. Ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've loved this app for years, but it did freeze up on me like previous July 2024 reviews state. I un-installed and re-installed the app & upon logging in again, it now works on my phone again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Downloaded latest update on my tablet (android 12) and all the useful tabs at the bottom of the screen (including notebooks tabs) have gone! WHY? Have made sure NOT to update it on my phone. Evernote no longer cares about being user friendly. Used to be great, now it's a palaver trying to find anything. Will not be renewing subscription. Really gone downhill"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frequently loses notes that are written using this app, and the UX is garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app no longer works on my android phone as of a few days ago. I am so angry - I use it for many things, and I PAY for it as well. Still works on my PC - but that isn't as important as my phone. Either FIX THIS ISSUE or I will unsubscribe and switch to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"As of 7/17/24 the app works if you clear the cache in the app settings, then uninstall and re-download the app. Then signin again. This removed the black screen for me. Using a Samsung zflip phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have had this app for a long time and have loved it, up until recently. I can no longer open the app without uninstalling and reinstalling the app and constantly restarting my phone. As of this morning I cannot open the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Since last update app doesn't start stays on the splash screen pls help asap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Prima la usavo di continuo, da quando è stata acquisita, la versione free è piena colma di avvisi che spingono ad acquistare un abbonamento premium.. cambierò con un'altra app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the last update, it won't even open past the initial screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Price so expensive. The share functions not working for me and my recipients. The recipient have to create account and log in to open the shared file - no info provided for this. Cannot do quick file sharing. Please fix this ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app no longer works on my phone. I have used it on Android for some time, but now, after finding my user name, the screen goes blank not even asking for a PW which it usually does. This is a deal breaker for me, and Evernote support has not responded after submitting three requests to them. Android OS is current, and i have removed and reinstalled to app at least twice with the same result."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost all of my 2024 notes with the new app version!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""the next time you open the app, it will undergo an optimization process"" aka it will never launch again. Horrible, can't use at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"An indispensible everyday tool, never forget anything again. Keep ideas, notes, reminders etc. always with you. !!! Too bad however its performance degraded with every update and currently since the lastest update it's almost not usable anymore at all !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of 7/16/24, the app won't even open AT ALL anymore. It just stays on the splash screen. I waited for 30 min.+, and nothing happened. I can't believe I'm still paying for this. I keep hoping it's going to return to it's former glory some day, but it seems like it just gets worse and worse with every update. If the app won't open at all, that is unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has become a nightmare to use with how slow it is. Sometimes it won't even load my Notes at all forcing a reinstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really hate doing this, but this app is a 1* to me now. For almost a decade, I've given it a 5* review. But it's a joke at this point. 130 for a 1yr subscription. Hard pass. And I'd have kept it 5* if it let me keep my current setup, but forcing me to upgrade in order to do anything, that's a no. [I could kinda understand me not being able to add anymore, but taking away negative] Makes me sad because I really loved Evernote and turned several people onto it. It was a good run. Rip"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App response time is very important to me for a note taking app. I need to jot down notes quickly in the middle of tasks and conversations. While this app has improved the web access is still extremely slow. It takes several minutes to come up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got the paid version and app won't even open. What good is a notes app that just freezes when you need it the most?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Still the worst app. Not recommended at all. If only paid user can use it dont let free user to even install the app. Pathatic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Facing an issue where the app is suddenly unable to open links. :( Big fan of this otherwise, been using it for a solid few years now. Pls help!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I gave 5 stars and have relied on evernote for years, but updating my review to 1 star in July 2024 simply because the app won't even open on my android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did say - in 2019 upgraded to 5 stars - It is now a useful habit to have and indispensable. Please could we have the option to share notes to other applications rather than just send a share connection... could we actually send a copy of the notes. Updated July 2024..MUCH too expensive, restrictive and out of touch with modern user requirements. Now using Google Keep in preference for my usage case. Downgraded to 1 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped being able to login on the Android app. It just tells me Error signing in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this for years. It's a good app but recently they started restricting more and more behind a pay wall. It started with a note limit. Now they allow you to sync only a single device. The price point is ridiculous as well. I am uninstalling and moving to a new note taking app. Disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it was great until it started getting glitchy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't Open Mobile App on Samsung. I got the paid version to have full access to the features but the app is continously glitch and now doesn't go past the landing page. Such a waste of money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why do you take a good thing and make it suck? At a minimum, I'd say it needs to work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't what it is supposed to, at least before the paywall. I suddenly can't make any more notes, because it tells me I am at my limit of 50 before I need to upgrade to premium. I have 16 notes. Every button you click brings a paywall pop-up, with absurd prices. Very frustrated. Update: I can't use it anymore, because of the popup that happens telling me I've reached my limit on synced devices. If I exit the popup, it comes back instantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I started using this app as my primary note taking app around a decade ago. They have slowly over time been removing key features. It started by only allowing a couple of devices per account, then they made it so you only get 50 notes, now they only allow 1 device synced at a time. They offer a pay version that has these features, but is absolutely not worth it given how much it costs. There are note taking apps that are just as good as this that have full features for free. Never download this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote no longer works since recent update. I cannot open or save files/information... Uninstalling"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote please stop being so greedy thinking you can manipulate or force people to pay for your app. We will simply use other apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time. No doubt if you make notes you've read reviews as to what is the best 'free' note app online and arrived here, this was then. Now this app shovels sub attempts down your throat at any given turn. It used to be great but with it's new heavily money grabbing regime, you can't access any note without multiple attempted cash grabs. Sure these guys need money to live. Remember the good old days when you were in this industry for reputation? I'm transferring my notes elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App was good, except for the snnoying sign up subscription pop up all the time, but ever since today it required only one device to be signed in. Which is awful and render this app useless. Will be looking for another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The last several updates have trashed this app. I've been using it for 12 years, and it's gone from my essential app to a dumpster fire. They're holding my data hostage for exorbitant subscription fees, forcing updates that destroy my settings and crash the app until I uninstall and re-install it, and adding useless 'features' that make it less efficient and harder to use. I am really angry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scam. They are taking way all free services. It went from many devices, to 2 devices, to one device on the free account. Sooner or later it's going to be no devices on the free account. Their monthly fees are outrageous. I might as well buy O365. Also, the app is EXTREMELY laggy. This used to be a great app, not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for 8 yrs and now all my notebooks are suddenly gone??? Cancelling my paid subscription. I'll never use this app again. TO ANY NEWCOMERS: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The push for paying for a monthly subscription is ridiculous. Unsubscibed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has always been my go to notes app but over the past year or so it has become almost unusable with constant pop ups trying to pressure your into paying for the premium plan and now it keeps blocking me from doing anything and telling me I need to unsync a device even though the only device on there is this phone. A real shame that they have completely ruined their app in a bid for your money, but just dont give it to them and use a different notes app instead because this one is not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for many years. This WAS a great app. Now I can't type more than 4 letters without it freezing up. I've begun researching alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need nothing more to store and access my private information. Update: I've long switched to Google Keep, it's easier and less frustrating. Plus, it can be interfaced with all my different devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Phone went from ***** down to * in the most recent update around 7/1/24. It can't find my notes, years of them. This new release fiasco bug has been going on for a while now. Not worth a subscription if you don't support the newest versions ASAP! Not to mention feature changes to implement a Bending Spoons $130/year limited access model with no external data compatability. No Thanks. Good job breaking a great app guys..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Despite cancelling the auto payment for monthly subscription, payment was made and subscription was not renewed. It still shows 'evernote free'"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Pra mim continua sendo o melhor aplicativo de notas, disparado. Uso há mais de 10 anos, já testei praticamente todos os outros, e não tenho a menor vontade de deixar o Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a premium member, Reminder was helping me a lot in my day to day work. U guys just removed it and listed under filter. Where I have to filter everytime to access my reminder notes . What's the point ? . You guys do update like downgrades. I'm forced to switch to alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not working in creating an account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: after making the app useless with a constant bombardment to buy it for hundreds of dollars a year now they created a known login issue. It's just really sad to make it this far as a company and literally throw it into a dumpster fire"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now it pushes the paid version everytime you open or edit a note. Trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"👉🌱🌻🍒"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app used to be great!! However, Since the most recent update the app keeps opening and closing on me; causing me to Uninstall and then Install it back to get it open to my content. I AM CURRENTLY PAYING MONTHLY for this app because it is my ""go to"" for a lot of things. Fix it!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Buena app para toma de notas"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I use it all the time. Was a 5, now a 3. It suffers from feature bloat and clutter, and has become unreliable. And, the price has tripled from 2022 to 2024."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great little app. In conjunction with password protection, a secure place to store sensitive digital information."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"impossible to write with a stylus."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Let's face it: acquisition by who knows, ditching free users, countless unstable updates... This is not even a tiny shadow of the giant Evernote used to be. Its time has run out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is actually good now. Would be nice to have all three ""save to evernote"" options, like the chrome web clipper. Needs 24h clock option and android calendar widget though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't print my notes from this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no match for Evernote Legacy, buggy, slow, impractical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good to See frequent updates of recently after the company takeover. Request the new Evernote team to seriously look into : 1) Mobile Android app is too slow. 2) Add tags to tasks 3) restore the feature of 'sort the notes by Notebook'. 4) Search command does not produce all the notes with the 'text' searched for. Results show only few random notes...not all. Points 3 and 4 were working very fine in Evernote legacy version. Home Dashboard has been a game changer for good !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible the fre version is just not worth it . Deleting the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a very loyal user for long time,if you want to change the app. to completely payed and no free user respect us, notify me so I can collect my notes, I spent two hour to copy only 13 notes, because of this stubid notify to subscribe. I just copy the ones I can't leave without, and neglect others cause I can't loose a day beside your app. Finally unistalll thanx god"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful. I'm a slowly migrating to Microsoft notes far superior and free. Every single time I use this app I am bombarded with promotional offers. Cant wait to delete it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Well done Evernote. After years of glitchy software, now evernote works beautifully and it's near perfect. Evernote is an indispensable tool for all my notes for almost every aspect of my life. Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Simply the buggiest app I've ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible. The app often crashes, after which the app refuses to open. Notes don't synch. I can't even open notes anymore. It used to work so well, but now it's barely useable. What happened?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't understand anything what the Hale was going on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"You know what I mran"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be really good and user-friendly; now it works so badly. Every page buffers so slowly (p.s I use a high-end smartphone), difficult to copy and paste, and now limitations have been placed on the number of notes that can be made. Signed out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"slow app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to constantly uninstall and reinstall every time I want to use it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow performance, harass user with subcription suggest"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer runs on Android. Opens to a logo screen them pops up a slow counter at 13% or 25% but never finishes whatever it is installing. Multiple restarts and uninstall-reinstalls don't fix it. It's now useless on Android. Looking for a way to convert my data to OneNote. Original review: Flexible, simple, works on all platforms. Many extras and plugins are available to make it yours."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your current tariff plan limits you to 1 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Not sure why would you pay for a free app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Péssimo! Impossível usar por causa de tanta insistência para comprar o app, dificultando inclusive a opção de não querer comprar, tentando ""dar volta"" no usuário."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app does not work like it should. For example on making Sketches. May you please improve on that. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Funny signs? When I use the danish letters æ ore ø in a note?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote since 2015, the last few updates have been uninspired. The last week I have been unable to make notes with my phone. I have uninstalled, updated it I'm seriously looking for a better option...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes are not properly syncing between two devices and it's not editable friendly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote Is Bit Laggy On My Phone I Have Upper Mid Range Processor Dimensity 1080 App Shouldn't Be Laggy On My Phone But It Does So My Experience Is Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Improved to the point of useless. I've got to get my stuff off of here. Guess that's my weekend accounted for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Update July 7, 2024: You have made it extremely impossible to share notes now. It worked better when you could send it by text. Recent Edition: I am not used to having to share notes through email instead of texting, but I will get used to it. HOWEVER, I recent update causes the keyboard to work extremely slow or barely appear. I still love this app and won't delete this app; but I need you to fix the issue with typing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Welcome to Clipboard Manager. 😄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription Service hidden within; wasted my time pretending to be a free app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aaarrrrggghhh!!! Updated to this latest version, now THE most sluggish, unresponsive app on my phone....AND I pay for it annually! Thanks Bending Spoons...now what??? Urgent hot-fix this weekend I hope. 😡🤬. The irony of the Update Release Notes ""Performance improvements..."" Seriously??? Sack the Test Manager & Test Team. (Already looking at a suitable alternative App to switch to...such a shame, have supported this App since its first release years back)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There was a time when this was the best note making App. But it has changed for the worst. Not able to launch the desktop app, no active user support, incompetent forum experts, and basic features like new note creation are converted to paid service. The joke is the desktop App won't start even when I am trying to opt for paid subscription. I have been a loyal user since it's early launch years and it is sad to see the service quality fall below standards. Not recommended anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"WAY too many features all in one app to give up. I am grateful for Evernote every day in so many ways. Makes my life easier."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App force closes upon startup. Has been doing this for a while now. Luckily I can access my notes on my pc, but not having the ability to view them on the go is a problem. Any chance of it being fixed, or is Evernote just discontinued on Android devices? Update: app ""works"" now. They made it pay for more notes, but it doesn't even like editing existing notes. The keyboard will randomly close, or just stop typing all together. Never paying for an app with so many issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"IT'S SO SLOW PLUS IT AUTO ROTATES"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app worked fine for a while but with the newest update (as of 07/13/2024) I can't access any of my files from my phone. They have all disappeared. They still exist, I know they exist because I can access them on my desktop and through the search bar on mobile but they don't show up on the main page. I do a lot of my writing on my phone so if I can't access my files on Evernote I might as well just switch back to Samsung Notes. It's a good app sometimes, I just wish that it worked more often."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened!? I loved this app. I used it for everything. To do Lists for home and work. Writing reminder notes, jotting down ideas I have. Now it doesn't load when opened and even had an error for my login. I am severely disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is not working after all the updates. It is hanging and cannot open. Very unhappy and dissatisfied paying customer. Suppose to be better but it's getting worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Latest updates (July 2024) have my Pixel 7 Pro phone freezing on Evernote startup, when going from one Internet provider to another, such as Wifi to cellular or a different WiFi network. I then have to go to Apps, clear data cache and login again. App has recently been very good but this is now quite annoying. Desktop and browser versions are fine."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Years after their aweful program rewrite it's still way way too slow, laggy and buggy. It's never going to get any better, it's written in javascript. I've at last found Obsidian as a suitable replacement and it's lightning fast and simple."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Probably the worst note-taking app in all of existence, The stupid pop-ups asking you to pay are really annoying like way too annoying like they are trying way too hard annoying. This is clearly a company desperate for money at this point and they are willing to ruin a perfectly good app just for a few extra pennies do not download this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible customer service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm sick of all the changes n why doesn't the create button work all the money I pay for this everything should work properly n the lag is ridiculous. Stop trying to please everybody cz it ain't working. Also I'm a LYRICIST n use the app to write songs however the audio timer stops working when I restart the beat. I have to close the note and reopen for it to work. FIX IT."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is great... when it works. I've lost count the number of times I've needed to take a quick top of mind note or task, only to open the app and for it take ages to load (like minutes) or for it to completely crash for hours. It's even worse for the desktop version. And this problem has gotten worse over the course of the 2024 updates. It's incredibly frustrating to not have the app work when you need it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you use Windows and android to edit notes you will get a message indicating that the note contains unsupported formatting. Ultimately you will not be able to edit notes. Annoying because it's nice to be able to edit notes both from my phone and from my home computer. Pop up ads make this app almost unusable. Switching to google notes and deleting this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite app. It was one of the firsts I would download with every new phone. Now the app is just outright intrusive. Every click has a popup begging for money. People at intersections don't even bother you this much. Ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"this app is amazing!!! and sm better than the other notepad apps ive used. the only problem i have is that it's too slow compared to the others 😭 it takes a few seconds to do stuff like create a new note or load ur prev ones"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was an amazing app but the premium version is ridiculously expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app for those who want to stay on their A-game. It's a no brainer for brainiacs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't open this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used it for years. Got a new phone today, transfered everything, downloaded the app and can't log in. It's an endless loop with chrome. Firefox won't display anything and log in failes with error when done via inkognito mode. Can't log in with google either. Evrytime i try to log in, a new pop up window opens, which is blank. Great job. The app is useless now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreliable performance, in-app updates that hang forever (requiring reinstall every time), notes that disappear...and more. Been using EN for 11 years and it gets worse and more expensive every year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was my go-to app for quick notes taking cause I can sync it with the Mac desktop. But now, the app has become so slow and all these annoying pop ups to subscribe is driving me insane."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I gave 5 stars in 2015. It was a cool app at the time. 9 years later, I am migrating to another app because free accounts are limited to one notebook and 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had Evernote premium for over 10 years. Their latest update has messed it up. The app now has crashed on me every time I open it. I've had to reinstall it multiple times and it still keeps crashing. Why would you mess up a perfectly well working app? So disappointed. I'm going to look elsewhere for a better app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be ok but never great and now is virtually unusable... I'm only keeping it from sheer laziness of finding a better option. I only write reviews if it's really good or really bad... colornote is vastly superior just doesn't have images option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App keeps popping annoying messages to get paid version(or free trial) all the time. It pushing too much for paid version to point that I am uninstalling this app for good. Loads of free apps available and nothing wrong in being a freeloader as most apps these days track user data! And who know how they use data. Not worthy enough to put hard earned money for paid sub. Good: Editing is quick and easy Co authoring good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updated , can not open the app on July 10 2024. Not able to use! Please fixed the issue."

July/10/24 My documents(notes, ect) are not opening. I can't read, open or able to make new entries to this app. I reached out to the developer without luck. Terrible customer service"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be one of my favorite apps. I used it for all kinds of purposes from general note taking to planning entire vacations. I recommended it to everyone I knew for YEARS. However, this app has gone from awesome to virtually useless in a very short period of time. Every time I open it I get non stop pop-ups to buy the subscription. The cost is absolutely not worth it and I am searching for a new notes app. What a shame."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated today, can't access my notes. The warned optimization process never finished after 10 hours. Disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another update and more stuff doesn't work. Come on people. Very frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like so many, your latest update has made search, editing etc.. Unusable. All notes content are gone, app totally useless! Shame because the new UX and speed was promising 😔. I resorted to use the desktop web version on my mobile which is far from ideal! Please fix or roll back!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cant log in for months on the app. Uninstalled and reinstalled, same issue. Won't load the email/pw login page. This is ridiculous. I'm paying for premium, but can't even log in to use the app. I'm about to move to a different platform service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years. The wonder child has grown into a confused and chatty ( prompts, ads ) adolescent. I'm abandoning it. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The recent update erased all my notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"On literally each open note it pushes a fullscreen proposition to switch to a paid version. The last straw to migrate to another platform and delete it finally"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"OI!!! READ ME PLEASE!! I cant make a new note.. I only have 22 notes stored.... it say im allowed 50 notes! Can this be fixed please i need to make notes? I will post this on every public forum if i have to"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why oh why have you removed the option to set the HOME screen as the Default Launch Page in the Android version of the app?? You can do this on the Desktop version and you used to be able to do it in the Android version. What's the point of setting up your Home screen if you, in your infinite wisdom, have made it a complete faff for the end user to get to the Home page?! When I pay for the Personal plan I expect the app to get better over time, not worse. Please fix this ASAP. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update makes application unable to load anymore, sad because I definitely preferred this method of keeping notes and tasks organized. Will have to use something else until they fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent app for taking notes and maintaining the record of tasks for people of all age groups and professions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What have Bending Spoons done to this app? Since takeover, its become buggy, data disappearing needing re-install, wont open with 'circle of death' wheel etc. Such a shame, good use of $200m plus ticket?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Sort by Reminder feature has been removed with the update. My notes are scattered and disorganized. Using Evernote without this feature is a nightmare. I have been using Evernote for years. I use it everyday for all my personal and business tasks. It is one of the most important tools that I use on a daily basis. Update: Notebooks and notes have disappeared from my account. I have tried several times to contact Evernote. I am only getting auto responses. Frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"In the Evernote widget, it will be nice to include action to append to an existing note just as we already have action to create a new note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used to be awesome this week (08Jul24) I have to uninstall and reinstall EVERY DAY in order to keep accessing my notes getting really annoyed with this malarkey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They took a great app and made it....this. My favorite new feature is that it takes twice as long to load now. Update: somehow they made it even BUGGIER!? HOW! This app was perfect before they drastically changed it and now it's the most unstable app on my phone!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, really enjoyed the ability to include drawings in my notes, latest update has deleted 99% off my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid it! There are many better alternatives with more options. They will send you many pushy ads for their paid service every time (!!!!) you open the app after you get used to it. And you have to answer ""no"" many times a day to access your notes. What a shame!!! It's just another tricky marketing app that wants nothing but your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this for nearly everything! Edit: This app has now completely gone black. I have lost ALL my ID account numbers, passwords, and usernames and more. Dont use this app! Evernote, please help me recover my information 🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was an excellent organizer with the most diverse app for keeping track of ""notes"" and just about anything. However, recently, the app has not been working properly and does not open all existing notebooks and notes. A fix is desperately required before I change the note app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be my favourite notes app, but now it is completely unusable without a subscription. I can't even get to my notes without going through the constant pop-ups asking me to select a plan every few seconds, which then takes 3 more clicks to get rid of. Clearly, these guys don't know nor understand their customer base. I recommend everyone to switch to Notion. It's free and 10x better than Evernote; I've lost my patience and I'm now officially making the move."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"You guys have come a long way in a short time. Pleased with functions and updates. Not thrilled about cost to maintain access to my old workouts as I don't really add to the storage anymore, though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Note taking tool. Great for organizing your thoughts and ideas. But lately not been very smooth to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New version requires me to update my password. Yet every password I tried generates the message, ""New password must be different from your previous one."" And of course I can't get support because that requires you to log in first. Unreal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"July 2024. On Samsung Note 10+ your application is not working- a lot of Notebooks are missing and a lot of the rest are incomplete (notes are missing)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just love a notes app that when you go to type and it just stops and then you have to delete the word and start over to even get it to work. You would think basic things like typing would be FUNDAMENTAL in a note taking app that requires you to pay $180 a year or however ridiculous the fee is now. I'm jumping ship. Been a long time user and I love it when it works but these bugs of basic functionality are just ludicrous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Simply doesn't work. Doesn't login even after forcing me to use a vpn, possibly because the devs blocked my area which is racist"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently performance has been abysmal. Rarely loads notes and does not show all my notebooks. I had to clear data to get it to load again but it is short lived as issues occurred within a day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the update on 7.4.2024 all of my notes have disappeared. Not cool at all. Hopefully, others were not affected by this most recent update and the company is working behind the scene to correct this. I have not had any issues with this app in the past and had been quite pleased with it. I have my fingers crossed I am able to retrieve my notes someday."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New bug: can't edit an existing note. So infuriating! Update: it's not a bug, it's a feature... I guess. The Edit button is gone and now you have to double-tap. Evernote continues to annoy with updates and changes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not truly a free plan if it bugs you to sign up for the paid tier every time you click on something in it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give negative stars. I'm a paid subscriber with over 10 years of using this app. I used to love this app - but now with the latest update, I can't edit my notes. This is ridiculous. It was an awesome app before and I loved it. Now it's worthless because if I can't edit my notes, what's the point? And the new format? Hate it. Now I have to spend more time and extra clicks. As soon as I find another app, I'm uninstalling this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New version never works anymore. I keep all my recipes on this app and each update makes it more confusing and harder to use. This newest one is the worst. I have deleted the app reinstalled changed password and still it crashes again and again. I will be migrating all my info off this app asap and asking for a refund. Been with Evernote for as long as I can remember."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Notes are still slow to open after launching the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is no longer a useful app for taking notes, it is now a nonstop barrage of ads trying to sell you premium features. Switch to Google Keep, unless you like closing 3+ pop-ups before you're allowed to jot anything down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They want money to use it, 7 days for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great Notebook App, but seriously? I honestly think this is the best notepad app or there and have been using this app since 2011. Lately though, I've definitely been looking for replacement. The app should not hound me for upgrading to a paid version which I have ABSOLUTELY ZERO use for, EVERY SINGLE TIME I open the app or a note. The app is great but not worth being harassed over for me to upgrade. Must be new management."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Really useful app, I like it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I stopped using Evernote because it doesn't use end-to-end encryption by default, meaning the company can read your notes and make money off your data. I recommend Standard Notes instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: used to love this app, but now I get bombarded with so many upgrade pop-ups it renders it useless. Hate the deceptive design that they've implemented where the primary call to action button is the purchasing button. I've stopped using the app altogether. If I could give this app zero stars I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"my fav note since 2014.. until a couple months ago..they want to subscription for improvement.. and its ok for me bcs i fell comfortable with this app..but this update was annoying for me.. i paid for comfortable used but now i cant find my notes.. i dont now how to find one.. very bad! I will search another app.. and remove all my note here"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have not been able to get into this app for more than 24 hours. Why? It used to be great!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote started losing my sketches. Hard to trust a note taking app when it loses critical parts of your notes. Bad support also, I've reached out to support 2x about this and nothing. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy, limiting, non stop ads. And obnoxious demands for money.. no longer like this app. I had this app for many years and used it regularly to retain info.. Seems like new management wanting to milk me for money non stop and now limiting my ability to store more data .. No problem.. I'll take it all somewhere else.. Migrating it all now and I'm Done! Thanks for the wake up call.. Good luck with that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"070724 improving... 26.10.23 update: Bough new 8gb RAM phone for this app, still Crashes and freezes... new vers. removed multi select notes (for moving notebooks for instance) and eksponentiel loadtimes. Forcing me to increase pc time (eg towards organisation) is a huge negative. Adding tasks doesn't not make up for it Long time user, big fan in general. BUT app is problematic: Crashes when I open big notes etc. (...)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Adequate for storing copied and pasted notes. Adding a new note has been taking 20+ seconds to load so I've started using a quicker app. I get three pop-ups to upgrade with each note I access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It holds your notes hostage if you don't pay. Four presses worth of ADS for accessing ONE of your notes. If you want to review three of your notes, you'll have 12 wasted presses. Spineless developers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love the simple design. But with recent UI redesign and forceful subscription push, it has become the worst app ever. Random annoying pop-ups, slow and sluggish UI."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you forcing me to pay for a subscription before I create more notes? Ridiculous! ZERO STARS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With 4th of July update app just DELETED ALL MY NOTES!!!! 10 years of using this app, and then with no warning..... Gone. And you've been asking us to PAY for this app!?!! App just gets worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app has gone seriously downhill over the past few years. The functionality is garbage now and they CONSTANTLY nag you about upgrading to a paid account. Definitely don't recommend this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why i am facing login issue can you please fix and why application redirect to website?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What is going on? I've been using this app for YEARS AND YEARS and suddenly it got very restrictive. I can only see my account in ONE device?.... And i have to pay now if I want to wrote more notes. Really annoying. Give a good reason to not go and only use Keeps or something else? Maybe I'm being petty, but it is a note app. Put some advertisements. Don't charge me suddenly for something that I never had to pay, and that is so easy to get for free. Sorry, that's how it works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before evernote's plan to let us have only up to 50 notes without paying for evernote pro,I had already had more than 200 notes and guess what not a single one of my notes can be downloaded and viewed. They are important to me been using this app since 2016 help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crash when opening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the longer I use Evernote the more I think I'm going to lose all my work. being locked out of my account. unable to login. notes not loading. notes not saving. I started around 2014 and now I'm looking for something simple, reliable and that doesn't put innovation ahead of quality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 4 star. Latest update is now causing me to think about requesting a refund and finding other options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved it when it was free. I stored all my important information. Now that they charge I can't get my information because of a pop up for subscription won't go away. It's like they're holding my important information hostage. I hate this app. It's so wrong. I just need to get my information out I don't want to give them a cent to retrieve my information. It should be illegal. Beware! If you care about your stuff didn't trust them!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many adds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Bloated app, I hate every time I have to open it. I have to get my recipes out of this thing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EN now closes in the background after a few minutes. This is not a positive change."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app used to be great. I've had it for probably a decade. It's unreliable, keeps taking my biometric protection off, and now it restricts how many notebooks you can have. I'm going to the Microsoft suite and given a try. I'm going to hate moving decades of notes but I have little choice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used ro be good. Now it sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst note app ever I hate using Evernote I m moving to notion waaaaaay better!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, simple and easy to use before. Now.. well on every click there's an ad to buy subscription.. right now I'm not even able to log into my account. Everytime I click on login it says ""a client side exception has occurred"". I re-installed it twice but of no use. Fix it ASAP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Super annoying that it pushes you so hard toward a paid subscription. All I wanted was a simple note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What kind of a useless update is this? Just to go and get the code sent to my email, the whole page reloads and I will start a fresh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"at first is says it has a free account with limited features which was fine by me, then after a month it locks me out and says limit reached and i have to pay to continue, and the twisted part is i cant access the notes that i created for the past month unless i pay, this is disgusting and evil practice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This stupid developer recently updated the app to limit free users to a maximum of 50 notes. How desperate for money are you to come up with such a disgusting strategy?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'd give zero stars if I could. this app used to be good. manageable. years ago. now it's nearly impossible to use and I get an email every other day that someone from across the country signed in. no matter what I do or how many times I change my password, someone hacks in. it's exhausting and annoying. simply terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is compromised. Data is leaked to darkweb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was already janky and now it won't let me log in via Google."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app to really maintain track on pending items and manage my second brain"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app, the free version is awful and I refuse to ever put money into it to see if it gets better. Duplicates notes for no reason, makes me sign into a new account for no reason, constant glitches that disappear and reappear for no reason. The scratch pad is terrible, constant duplications. I deleted tgat note a week ago why are you defaulting to it on a scratch pad? Hideous app thats only gotten worse over the last year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is trash. Deleted over a decades worth of notes with no notice. F these clowns. Was charged $34.99 with NO NOTICE please refund immediately! NO MENTION OF AUTO RENEW ANYWHERE UNDER PLANS OR TOS. Not planning to renew subscription due to issues with widget functionality- left the following up for a year and never addressed : Need a 3x1 widget for desktop everytime I try to use the one in my widget drawer it says ""widget not supported"". PLEASE FIX"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now, the pop ups are nauseating. I'm off to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Me quito de aquí, hay aplicaciones gratuitas y de dispositivos ilimitados que tienen mejores funciones qué aquí."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally useless now with this forced subscription. An end to an era. What a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"poop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app should be banned in India, it's not processing my account permanently deletion/closing request, it's a suspicious move from Evernote,I am going to file complaint against Evernote to India government."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Sold out to BS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Performance Improvement and miscellaneous bug fixes was the recent update today and after update app Keep crashing. Not able to use. Kindly roll back to previous version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Last moths a couple of great features. Evernote is not dead!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my #1 app starting in 2016- legacy user. I used it for work, home, journal. I shared folders and notes with others, loved all of the features back then in a simple to load minimal design. Then update after update the more features it got the slower it went. The sync stopped working so I had 4/5 of the same file trying to find the most recent. The prices went up and up and I finally called it quites. Switched to Google drive and just use docs or sheets now- syncs with real offline"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time user of this app, and I am exhausted with all the deficiencies with each update. The latest version allows exports into proprietary file formats only, and formats don't paste into Word, and there still is no mass export capability into MS formats, and there are lots of issues with selecting, pasting, and line feed returns. I also lost half of a file, was unable to restore the prev'ly saved version. This app doesn't do what it should...I'm done. Google Docs does it best."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"any app that interrupts work for me to rate it is bad by design"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Monstrous limitations for the free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Hate the new update! It's so confusing and unnecessary ugly!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great revamp of the entire UX/UI. I love Evernote even more now. I would just love to see an integration with GenAI capabilities next please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but has been rendered basically unusuable with the constant un-toggleable upgrade pushes, removal of sorting functions, and harsh limitations to free users. The paid version is way overpriced for the services on offer. Look elsewhere for a notepad app if you don't want to close paid upgrade reminders every single time you try to do anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Copying internal link doesn't copy internal link, copies web URL instead. Cross-linking must be done on desktop app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Musergy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's easier to use than one-note, particularly if you use it across devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"169 USD PER YEAR UPGRADE? UH, NO"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be OK, but now unusable. Constant sync issues and now you can't even use the app because it is permanently blocking the view of your notes with upgrade now ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Please correct! New (two) updates are causing app to glitch! Letters are being halted/can't type full words! Tried new Note. Same with all notebooks. Dealt with 3 ads upon opening app... but enough is enough. It's 2024. Time for other options/apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"pop up, restrictions, slowness. Why pay for this when one note is free and there are so many other options. This was my favorite but now Uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I open the app is my ""last chance"" for their premium service. And so is every click in between pages. I'm done, peace"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly, free app won't work and demands $169/yr. Go to hell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is not FREE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes dissappear or are difficult to find when you need them quickly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why force people to update this app when is broken and don't work at all , worst app Becoming the worst at all times , I only use this because of my work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been with Evernote for well over a decade. I use it just for journaling and saving web pages I need. In 2022 I paid $37, 2023 it was $50, now in 2024 they want $130!!! I have all of my memories from my kids growing up in here and I'm scrambling to get it out before I'm charged a ridiculous price! It's more than tripled in price in two years! Absolutely insane!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app since 2014, loved it for many years, and then in the past year the pop ups have gotten out of control! I have to click out of 3 pop up messages every time I access my notes. This is the most unbearable UI I've ever seen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The original spirit of this app developers which is its core value now turns to rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed will be it's downfall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been with Evernote for 10+ years, and sadly recently Im thinking about switching to other note taking apps. They limited the amount notes for free plan, which its kinda ridiculous. It's just a note taking app, its not netflix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Not happy with forced update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have recommended this app for many people. I hope you get good rewards. You helped many people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years but won't be any more due to it now requiring a subscription for more than 50 notes. Over the years they've kept adding to their money grab and now it's just gone too far and is ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best place for storing and sorting notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Insane amount of pop-ups about upgrading. I don't know what they changed but the old Evernote was way better. RIP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be great, now becoming pop up simulator. Pricing are ridiculously expensive. i might buy this for one time purchase but not subscription. very infuriating app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I didn't find my notes when I re-login the app in my new phone with the same I'd, what to do"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything became a mess, notes all got mixed up by system"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be one of the best note taking app out there. Now with being commercialized it has gotten worse- random pop-ups, lagging in opening files, files not saving and risk of losing the content. This is for the students, don't charge such high amount needlessly when they can just switch to word or some other note taker apk. I request developers to please consider this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless...looting money only"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it spams you with upgrade popups and sometimes stops you from getting to old notes, let alone create new ones. Switching to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Still pretty good but not as good as it used to be. Always wants me to buy the upgraded version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for a few years now and I've recently started having issues trying to make & edit notes on my phone for the past month. I've been hoping they'll fix it but they haven't yet. Web works fine!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Try-hard sellouts. This app used to be good YEARS ago, before turning into a constant, obnoxious subscription begging pile of hot garbage. They diminished the _*number of notes*_ you can have in-app, so that when I returned after years, it says ""remember all those notes you have? You already exceeded the amount. You should pay"". They don't even allow you to export your body of notes for a migration to other apps, since you gotta be stuck with them. Because.. would a moneygrabber ever allow you?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quite terrible. Ads after every tap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Much better now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*Too expensive *In app navigation too slow, causing some unresponsive interface. *Can't remove url link in the note? *Have you tested your app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but now it has decided it only needs paid users and have made it a bloated mess! I have very limited usage, still they impose restrictions after restrictions so I can't even create 1 note a month! Moving to notion"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update on 6/29/24: Downgraded from 5 to 2 stars for price gouging. 3 years ago I paid $34; last year $49, now next month $129!!!! I am now researching a replacement for this app. Too bad Evernote. This is how you treat a long-time, loyal customer. My previous review from years ago:Outstanding. This program was recommended by a Technician at a Sprint store after I lost all my notes on another Notes app when Sprint reset my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Edit: YOU BROKE IT WITH YOUR LATEST UPDATE! PLEASE FIX IT IMMEDIATELY! Consistency matters... Totally love how this App saves your info/data on the cloud & can be used cross platform. PC Desktop, Android phone, iPhone, MacBook Pro... it works on all of my devices & syncs up perfectly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worthy of a class action suit. No notification came to my email or msgs of being completely unable to access my notes after 3/23/24 (actually was 6/29/24) TERRIBLE management of an app. I am sick, and furious."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sign in. Can't find a real contact area. I've had this for years!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of advertisements for upgrading to a subscription every time I open the app or access a note is absurd! Have to go through many screens just to get to a note. Makes this app so annoying to us. Slowly migrating notes to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I created an account as a teams user, as soon as I created can't login to it. They will keep charging me for something they don't give me access to. Getting this error: Sorry, we’re having some trouble loading Evernote Web. Try reloading the page. Tried on 6 different computers 2 different t networks and 4 different support tickets. No answer at all, I'll file FRAUD with an attorney I know where their office, if they don't fix this issue. Can't cancel since I can't enter. Horrible programming."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This service/app is awesome and I no longer live without it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashes. Fails to load. Doesn't save notes. Every update adds more bloat and bugs. Every year it gets worse and more expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"had it for years, my life line"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is no free feature now. There now is a pay wall where you can't can't even look at any of your notes. Plenty of better options. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"suddenly it's limited . and with bugs . can't open most of my old notes. when i try to add new note the app crashes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Awesome UPDATE: Used to be awesome. Is terrible now. Super expensive and the free version doesn't even work right."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, but since the recent update it's become super annoying to use with the constant pop-ups wanting you to swap to the paid subscription. I would gladly pay a one-time fee for this app, but I have no use for a subscription. Especially not one that costs $130 a year! Furthermore, despite claiming that the free plan allows you to have up to 50 notes, it blocks me from being able to create a new note beyond the 25 currently in my notebook. I'm on the search for a new notetaking app"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Glossy Updates, Slow Performance : That sums up my experience with Evernote over the last year. I wish they would work on making the UI clean and intuitive or at least offer users the option to clean it up and remove elements some users might not need. e.g. I never use the tasks or the calendar, why do I have to look-at/scroll-past them? Loading of individual notes can be way snappier. I'm only sticking around because of Android & iOS interoperability. Team Evernote, pretty please?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What genious thought it was a good idea to have the text cursor jump all over the place every time you reach a check box in a check box list when you try to delete characters / lines? The devs of this app cannot stop breaking things that actually works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no pdf sharing option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"elfant"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love that with the new update I can play this game: how many times do I have to tap a note until it actually opens? Bonus: not remembering the position in a notebook gives my fingers quite the workout while scrolling and scrolling and scrolling again..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yet again basic strike thru checkbox editing functionality broken and shortcuts now buried so deep in menus it's hard to think of it as a shortcut. I think the people supporting(?) this app sit around and brainstorm ways they can break things and/or make them as difficult as possible. It's hard to give this app even 1 star these days."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant log in. Continue button doesnt work to sign in manually. Shouldn't have kicked me out in the first place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be great. Recently evernote is a piece of junk now. I can't even open a note. The search can't find any of my notes. The notes take forever to load. It's unusable. It's. Bloated. Please revert back to a year agos version. What good is an app if you add 100s of features but the most basic functionally sucks?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been a loyal Evernote user since 8 years, and I love it.. You can access it anywhere anytime and always synced Specially you can add pics too and comments. I save cooking recipes, journals, work notes, financial planning, to do list, it's basically my Digital notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute Trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Needs to stop with the excessive paid service prompts that have gotten so stupidly worse over the years that this app has gotten unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been trying to cancel Evernote due to the significant price increase. It won't let me cancel. Almost impossible. I paid 74.00 last year 2023. 2024 is going up to 119.00. I want this canceled by 7/17/24 on my renewal date. Ridiculous increase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app is amazing. Ive tried lots of notes apps and never found one with as many features as Evernote. Plus it's reminders and calendar attachments are amazing for my ADHD"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become even more unreliable and dealing with the constant solicitation to upgrade is something I no longer agree to do."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"4 stars. Not as snappy as I'd like it to be when opening up a new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why fix it if it's not broken? If you fix something that is not broken it will get ruined like Evernote is now. I don't mind paying for something that is useful to me and Evernote's subscription fee is absurd."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too slow and big"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be convenient apps. But now it force you to pay and as subscription based payment. Stupid idea, sorry but ain't nobody got spare money to spend for a mere note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"fair enough"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New updated version is full of glitches. You are typing and nothing gets populated you either need to erase and restart typing or get out and back in. I have been using this app for years and worked great before but now it is horrible. You edit notes and loose the changes. App is not worth a dime."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very well organized notebook really good at saving your thoughts and putting them on the cloud"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is complete piece of junk. One cannot access own account info: it just fails and tells there are too many redirects. The same applies to application web page. I really would like to terminate my account, but cannot do that due to completely broken system"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*Just got a predatory price increase notification - doubling my yearly cost. Looks like I will be parting ways with Evernote.* I've used this app happily for 9 years. Lately, it freezes a lot, and the search barely works. Horrible lag time. Please stop ruining this app I used to love."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It erased all of my notes this past update. It's a bad app. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps on pushing to pay aggressively lately"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im trying to transfer the evenote licence from one device to another, but the app wont allow. It assumes both have the app installed and will allow usage in neither unless there is a multi devuce subscription payment. Super restrictive trade practice . Super dusappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to like it...but they started restricting the amount of notes you have unless you pay. Now I use another app, but I can still refer to my old Evernote documents if I need too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good, now it's constantly crashing and asking me to pay every three minutes. I can't even get to the login page. It just hangs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great until now. Can't log on to account. Fix this asap!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app... And extremely expensive...Zoho notebook is a much better alternative in my opinion"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great product, BUT, Cost per value is hard to justify. Especially since it does not allow you to store to SD card."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years to take notes and journal. Not too long ago, they restricted the service to 50 notes total. I'm very disappointed in this change and have since switched to a different free notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for 10 years. Now nothing but pop-ups and you can't even type a word without it freezing until you back out of it, then repeat. Uninstalling!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the subscription fee is too pricey... i just take about 3 notes per month, it's doesn't suitable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost its quality, shody company. App says it limits you to 50 notes unless you upgrade but will not let me have more than 48. Officially looking for a better notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Стабильные отвратительные обновления на протяжении последних лет, не советую сюда соваться"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too bad. Now note taking only if you are taking premium otherwise you are not eligible for simple note. And pop-ups are everywhere. Makes app slower and cringy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pricey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote Seriously Improved Now ! ... Enjoy It !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This had been a fantastic app, but it has been ruined by greed. At one time, the free version was adequate for most users, & one had to deal with pleas for $ only on occasion. Now the harassment to fork over dough is truly obnoxious. They also changed the rules on what one can do with a free account, & even though I took the time to pare down to in order to meet the requirements, I'm still barred from creating a new note - their quoted limit is a lie. And the cost of subscription? Astronomical!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is this app not opening in the last 24-36 hours? It has cost me a lot because I have something important I need access to on it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"TOOK MY MONEY, DIDN'T UPGRADE MY ACCOUNT"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy dev's, always annoying u with subscription plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience, horrible..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been an Evernote user since around 2010, it was once my go-to note app for very basic notes. Shopping lists, notes about places I've visited etc. I loved the ability to format text for headings, dot points, check lists etc. This app slowly became unusable as features were stripped from the free version. I don't need the majority of the features of the pro version so cannot justify the cost. The free version is now filled with pop ups and has a very low note limit. I now use Amplenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had not used this app in months. Only ever used free version and then suddenly I have a $129.99 charge from it?!?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Why I can't log in my account. It is showing error"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A popup every time I open the app. ""Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade!"" I've never seen an app try this hard for people to pay. I've been using Evernote for years but in the last 8-12 months the popups are getting worse. I'm now unable to create new notes on the free plan. The popup states I only get 50 free notes, but the app details my exact number of notes, which is 30. This app is a dumpster fire. I recommend Notion or any other app that doesn't limit basic functionality on the free plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for over 10 years. I've created many notebooks and accumulated 100's of notes. Now all of the sudden I can't use the app because I'm over the 1 notebook, 50 note limit. Awful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Due to its slow performance and cumbersome interface, I've decided to discontinue using this product. It simply didn't meet my expectations for a quick and efficient note-taking tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app, helps me organise my book and the tours of London I created"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely insane subscription cost ($130/year) just to keep a bunch of text files in the cloud. For personal note taking, good alternatives are text files sync'd with your cloud of choice, Notion, or Apple Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the latest update, I can no longer sort by date. Why was this functionality taken away? After more than 8 years of using Evernote, I may be moving on. It's sad because it used to be an amazing app. To the developers, remember if it ain't broke don't fix it. It seems that you ""upgrading"" for the sake of ""upgrading"" not functionality. SAD!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous number of popups to click through every time you open the app trying to trick you into paying (find the tiny X, remind me later, no I don't want this deal, yeah I'm sure). It's a note pad. I'm not paying $15 a month for this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The most expensive app. Not worth downloading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Keyboard function stops working intermittently Tried recommendations nothing stops the problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to be a great note taking app, but then they have limited it so that I can no longer use it for free. I used this app for 8 years, but it has come to a point where I have to look for a different free app. I used to recommend this app to friends, but no more can I recommend it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A loyal ex-customer since 2015. I used to organize my whole life using Evernote. It was simple, clean, and cost efficient. Now I am switching because of all the extra unnecessary gimmicks, updates, and the unreasonable price increase. The difference between the free and paid subscription is ridiculous. Either 50 notes or 150,000 notes! Either 1 notebook or 2,000 notebooks! Either 60 MB or 10,000 MB per month. You should really consider adding a lite package in between with reasonable price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very difficult now to access notes quickly. Having to fight through a wall of ads. Time for a change."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I liked this app but it has become so costly and the free version is virtually useless. I've since moved to a different app. Microsoft OneNote is pretty good for simple stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app, but after they switched to being a subscription based app i am way over the limit of available notes i can make so i can no longer make any new notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good riddance Evernote. If I can't create a new note even after deleting 50/50 notes and having zero notes left, you're useless. User since 2010, and I deleted my account tonight. You've got to really make me angry to make me actually delete an account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since I updated Evernote on my Chromebook, It's not even get me logged in.I have a paid subscription and this App doesn't work on my chromebook.Please resolve the issue as early as possible. This is terrible.Bending Spoons is ruining everything I guess.App is getting crashed everytime, and ask for reload and then crash again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"In the Android version, in the notes tab suddenly the reminders disapeared. How can I bring back the previous appearance?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads for subscriptions, even for basic note-taking. Idon't recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has become paid only. This is end of evernote. I have moved from evernote and uninstalled it. Good bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have 5 notes that I access 2-3 times a month. Lately it became insupportable. It askes me to upgrade at ANY click I make in the app. Once I enter the app I usually stay in it for couple of minutes, under 5. I see the upgrade notification at least 10 times. I say no thanks. It appears again. It is almost impossible to use the app. If it continues I will take my notes and move somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The simple design of the app was the reason that made me like it so much. With the recent update, the app has become difficult to navigate and not to mention the ANNOYING POPUPS EVERYTIME I CLICK ANYWHERE. I just want an app to keep my notes! No, I do not want to spend hundreds and thousands of rupees to write down my grocery lists. If someone wants to buy the premium version, they will buy it. Throwing the popup in peoples faces will only annoy them into uninstalling the application. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a good app but now forces you to pay a subscription of £2.50 per week after you've used it for a bit which is an insane subscription for a task management app. Greedy owners. Avoid these leeches"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote for the last few years and love it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to be the best but it is not"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My laptop was getting hacked by this app. It was late at night but luckily I was awake. Suddenly my mouse started moving, which went unnoticed by me, but by mistake the hacker made a click which triggered brain.fm sound from my browser. I immediately started looking and disconnected internet. Upon further investigation I concluded that this app was accessing internet. In past I also got login notifications from Vietnam for my account. I request everyone to be v cautious with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WORST APP. > It was a great app 5 yrs ago. It is riddled now with ads and borderline fraudulently persistent pop-ups demanding you pay to use its minimal feautures. There are dozens of apps that do the same for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dear ""Bending Spoons"", with last update, reminders section on Android app has disappeared, making the app completely useless. 100€ and more of yearly subscription, to have a removed feature? Come on..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm not happy with the new update. I've been using Evernote for at least 10 years, loved it, now all of a sudden I can't sort by date and my reminders don't pop up anymore...Evernote was my life. Yesterday it was fine , today its not . Useless if I can't sort by reminder due date. Everytime I email support I get a generic response that its not the right contact- its like a loop. And I do have a paying account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Whenever i Write something in a note. And then save it. It just disappears. I dont know why. But please fix"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst user experience in years, felt like a hostage to this stupid app, don't ever come near"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Top app, recently has started improving again with simple useful updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good, apparently several years and versions ago. I recently had to upgrade to a new phone and with it was finally forced to update to this release: oh my god, how does anyone tolerate this? Constant, obnoxious popups to pay their subscription fee, any time you open it or navigate between pages. Formerly basic features like being able to access your notes on a browser costs 15$ now. It doesn't even open to the screen with your notes on it. Everything venture capital touches."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app with unlimited utility"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It seems Evernote is playing a game of hunt the widgets or shortcuts! Why can't we have the option of the original home page of widgets that we were able to customise for our own use? I use Evernote constantly but am beginning to get frustrated with the lack of ease of use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a decade. Now it wants to charge me $100+ PER YEAR to use it? Absolutely ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app started out with promise, and actually showed some improvements for a time. Then, apparently a decision was made to change the entire scope of the application. It was first gutted of choices in the settings, then features and functions I had come to rely upon vanished. The software then became more work than benefit. After closing my account and stopping the PayPal authorization, they still attempted to take payment! The last time triggered a fraud investigation. Good Riddance!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Just installed the app and I lost the datas I've stored for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So much good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a mess. I 'upgraded'. Now it doesn't work at all and I've lost all of my notes. Thanks a lot. Time to move to a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"indispensable tool for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"If I decline the subscription then leave it at that and STOP asking me to upgrade! GREED! That's all it is. Going to find another note taking app. Too bad as I've used Evernote for a very long time. All good things must come to an end I guess."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"One major problem. I have been using Evernote for years and often got annoyed because pdf attachment won't load in the app. AT LEAST one a week I have to wipe data from the app for my attached files to load. This is a very big problem when I need a file NOW. Other than that it's great but sadly I am done getting frustrated by this. I still have it installed because I paid for a yearly subscription but I am slowly transferring all my files to a other service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Come rovinare qualcosa che funzionava bene.. Utilizzata per anni, ho visto ogni aggiornamento peggiorarla di volta in volta. Comprendo che il free tutta la vita non esiste, ma la ridondanza di pop up e richiesta di abbonamento hanno completato un quadro che sicuramente riusciranno a peggiorare ancora .. visto il pregresso... Peccato l'idea e l'App erano davvero buone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Big Improvements The changes in Evernote since the were acquired have been brilliant. Simple things like numbering in notes, the way tasks now collect from notes to a general tasks tab. Very impressed with the speed of improvements! Well done 👍🏽"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app got worst. Can't even sign-in. First it logged me out without my consent. Then when I try to log in it doesn't work. I cleared Cache, Data and even updated the app and still doesn't properly give me the page to log in. Useless!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for a while now, over the past year the app has become utter garbage, extremely buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Phuk this company and their app. They just charged us $79 without notice, and it started with a 0.99 charge 5 days prior - no warning. I linked my account with my wife to share passwords and info such as Netflix password etc. and when we declined to pay, my husband's account completely disappeared on his phone. As of the time of writing this review, i am going thru hoops trying to block this transaction. When trying to cancel this on the app, they blocked me getting my info off the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If they aren't throwing up and ad to upgrade like 15 times every times I need to look something up, they're telling me I've reached my limit. Apparently all of a sudden my free plan now restricts me to 50 notes. I just need to be able to jot so e notes down from time to time and they want to charge me $129 a year. Screw this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it but freaking push to getting premium ads is killing it. I'll go for anything alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wrote ""The best note ever"" on May 15th, 2013 But now i revised it to ""the most stingy note ever"" today. I think no further explanation needed as we can see at their restriction and their pricing policy. I moved all my data to another note taking apps. Good bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"works great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love you guys!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Highly Useful. Thoughtfully designed. Reliable. Multi platform. Lots of clever features and functionality. Sincere kudos to the development team."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New review : the pricing is absurd for personal users like myself, and now everything I've done for years is locked. I've moved to Notion. Old review : This certainly has the potential to change my life!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"at this point just make the whole app paid, what's the point in having just one notebook and 50 individual notes before you need to pay 100€ a year for more? Not to mention it feels like every single click or change of page you make, you are reminded to buy premium. Like seriously, I enter a note and it screams in my face full-screen to buy y'all's plan. I exist a note and boom, again. Genuinely screw you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love it! Writing a book using Evernote. It empowers me to take my dreams out of my brain, order them, and create the narrative. Thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop asking me to upgrade!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to start new notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did work fine, but this morning I tried to edit an existing note that had a bunch of lines with checkboxes. Tried to add another, and couldn't find the way to do it. As I tapped various things looking, I inadvertently ""selected"" the whole body. Tried to back out of that and the whole text was deleted, with no ""save changes?"" question."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying as hell constant pop-ups, and a limit of only 50 notes, used to be good, but not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"After years of ineptitude, finally, a quality app, with efficient UI. Cudos to what appears to be a new team. A great relief, bordering on happiness"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing when opening links in notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"how the mighty have fallen, this was the king at one point, now with the price increases and Bending Spoons trying to make it a note/calendar/todo list app they have forgotten what made evernote great, the whole note part. I'm just using the app to archieve my notes and then it's uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app, can't use without account. hate this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was good , now disaster with advertisements and limitations for free option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too many ads for purchasing and buying the software... Unfortunately this app is no longer free it seems"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"sync too slowly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years. It used to be the go-to app for notes. I loved it and recommended it to everyone. Now, it is unusable without very unreasonable fees for a note taking app. As a free user I could no longer take any more notes at all, period. So essentially worthless. They dropped the ball in every aspect with this app. The functionality, the stability, the user friendliness. This app is not good, it should be avoided. Any other app is a better choice for your note taking needs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very portable!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There should be an case study on Evernote and how to ruin a user experience. I have been using Evernote Legacy for the last several years (years!) due to how slow and terrible the 'updated' app has become. Recently, I was forced onto the new version. Editing notes on mobile glitches and the keyboard disappears every time I hit the return key. Note loading is incredibly tedious. Who on earth wants this awful landing page rather than just a notes /notebook view? Fomerly great, now unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All new colourful turds on screen, but unable to log in to on my computer, stuck on the ""Signing In"" window, despite successfully ""Signed In."" Once a great app, now deserves to be forgotten, cancelled and left forever by everybody at least half sane. Never again anything from these ""developers"" who are unable to manage basic functions and just spamming you with rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Varied performance with notable glitches causing the need to transfer some notebooks/items into alternate apps to work on and then back into Evernote for storage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using this app for years. Last update has screwed with me again. PLEASE add WIDGETS as a choice in your ""Navigation"" >> ""Default Landing Page"" options! This would solve lots of problems for lots of people!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Mostly notes are normal except Evernote it has unique or advance features I like and love it You can install it 🤝"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Doesn't even let me open my notes, without a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I can sync mis notes between my HTC and mi ultrabook in real time... That's one problem less to worry about."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can not open pdf to drive anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great app. Used for years. Now it is just super anoying. Too many upgrade plan promptions. I have to spend half minute to close every prompt just to check small note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I feel cheated. I had an infinite ""confirm your email"" pop-up in app even though I approved it a million times. Eventually I understood it was all for me to update the app and get the terrible news with all the changed. Oh, and also with the ""upgrade"" some of my important notes updates from the last months has been deleted! Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The log in process is slow and clumsy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thumbs up!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was once brilliant. About a year ago, the numbskulls who bought it made it their life's mission to wreck it. The intrusive and aggressive pop-ups encouraging you to sign up to their overpriced premium plans accelerated this ""goal"". I had many notes from 10+ yrs worth of use, but I only really used the text functionality - now rendered unusable because of the limit. It is not worth my while to spend that much on a mobile notebook app. I have jumped ship, notes and all, to one-note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DON'T USE IT!! They will prompt you with subscription offers after EVERY screen transition.. ANNOUYING AND UNUSABLE!! Definitely moving away from it because it seems like they only want paid users.. Been using it for many years and still no support for right to left text.. Only getting greedier.. After writing down all my tasks, I'm prompted with an annoying subscription fee that cannot be dismissed to view what I worte! Wasted my time!! Disappointed..!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Has become a very slow to load site, on 'device' or my v fast home computers... Still no way or option to alphabetize within a folder; 2002?! lol 'More featues' that no one asked for, imo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Developers continually updating the app and dumping it on their users to find the new faults. There is no indication if the bugs that have been reported are recorded or recognised by the company because there is no direct contact/support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thr new user interface makes the app much harder to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New updates says without paying you can't make new notes or notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since the last update it is SLOW REALLY SLOW! I've used it for years and now need to consider a different app due to this. 2024 now can't use without paying for it. Deleted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"PLEASE BRING BACK LEGACY I DON'T ANY TO LEAVE YOUR SITE AFTER OVER A DECADE. THE NEW APPS ON PC AND ANDROID ARE BOTH AWFUL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why you became so greedy?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for at least 8 years. Super disappointed with the updated note limits. Not worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHY DID YOU ADD A STUPID MARGIN!!! There is absolutely no point in adding this margin, it ruins everything. I use this app for making numbered lists and this margin completely butchers my lists destroys it. PLEASE remove the margin PLEASE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Cada día más pesada, con características que nadie pidió. Lo que al principio era una app simple para tomar notas, la convertieron en algo lento, sobrecargado e inútil"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It used to be my favourite note app but I wish it'd stop trying to get me to join a plan every time I open the app and every time I press something, it's infuriating. At least do it every 5th time I use the app or something, I'm not going to change my mind in the 5 seconds between opening the app and creating a new note. I now use keep notes as my main note taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's sad to see Evernote is becoming that bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app actually really usefull for me who likes writing, and I like the features a lot. But unfortunetaly, when I comeback from a break, and about to write again, it become paid platform. Sadly, I have to uninstall it and find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to make this app on top list... Now it's the worst app to use, and now I'm lookin for alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Works well and have been using it for a long time. However it's riddled with ads and trying to sell membership that it's frustrating to use. Looking for a new notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been like 10 years, I guess, leaving the app due to new cap on notes. I have over the new limit and really need a notetaking app for short note taking"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a user of this app for years and WAS overall satisfied. It WAS fast, convenient and allowed me to write down literally everything: to do lists or shopping lists, notes during the lessons, just my thoughts or ideas, things I need to remember. Now I hate the app and I'm searching for a new one. It is slow. I need to log in after each update and it always glitches before I finally can do it. It restricted the amount of notes for a free plan and I already had more. It annoys me to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Add themwd icon finally. Also fix the app and add export feature so i can get rid of it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is horrible. I am spending 30 minutes to delete my account! And you guys have audacity to ask for money?! Product is so bad, you cannot input the confirmation code?!?! Leaving and never coming back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go-to. I was having issues recently (it became very buggy) so reinstalled and now all my notes have been wiped. Google Keep is much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even letting me change password. Also showing logged in other countries frequently. Concerned for security"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The feature to copy internal links from one note to another doesn't work properly in the mobile app. when you copy an internal link it pastes as a web link. it's been like this for ages."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"repeatedly forces upsell every time you use app. Every time I open it, I get 3-5 full screen popup boxes to get me to pay for premium. it's so annoying and invasive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a loyal user for 9 years, I’ve seen Evernote evolve. Recent price hikes ($100 more than 2 years ago) and underused features disappoint. Performance issues persist. Consider alternatives like OneNote or Joplin. Nostalgia keeps me, but I’m eyeing the exit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent app update is terrible. App used to launch with my shortcuts by default now it takes several clicks to get to my shortcuts, with no way to fix this. What's the point of creating shortcuts then? Please revert back to the old version where the shortcuts show upon launch."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My normal phone died. Tried to get to my notes and they say can't without info from my phone which does not work🤔. No alternative system setup if you need to get to your data. Shall start again with alternative software. 👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Stop messing with something that already worked, now it sucks, muscle memory is gone and have to find everything all over again, it takes more steps to make a note and place it in the proper notebook... Plus it seems like every other time I open the app on my computer it has to update and I'm stuck waiting again ... Leave it alone.... It wasn't broken...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Going more usable with new updates, those last years have been painful and still not as good as it was. Still too expensive. By the way I found another app but changing is time consuming so I am still here..hoping better times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously 5* glad with the free plan. Starting 2024, we (I & my family) are MOVING TO ONENOTE, due to ridiculous force to paid plan (otherwise CANNOT ADD NOTE). Why, because there are so many opt notes apps out-there. And, once we move, cannot go back, because, in fact, there are many better notes apps that we never explore. Since we trust Evernote, before the ridiculous force to paid plan was told."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"2024 Update: I don't know what they've been eating at Evernote HQ. But they have really stepped up their game. Common issues that plagued it for years are now gone and the app runs a lot smoother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is my 1st online note app years back. After Evernote limit 50 noted on free version, even my note less than 50, app still not allowed me to create new notes unless I upgrade my account. This is freaking SCAM Evernote. Good luck Evernote on your desperately making money out of your app users. I'm off for other alternative like many shared. Actually, you don't even deserved a ⭐."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even with the new updates it's still not working... The body of notes still not loading on tablet (but thanks for adding ability to put links to individual notes on homescreen of tablet.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 notebook, 50 notes? most phones have free note option, why would I pay 15$ a month for this??? I'm baffled. No thank you. I will use zoho notes for free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for a long time, but now I find it impossible to work with. Constant pop ups to buy a plan, very limited notes and one notebook for free version... It's the end for me, not spending money in this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Basically unusable if you don't pay. Was a good service now it's worthless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App was decent, had problems. Now it's unforgiveable bad. I'll just use Google Drive. No thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm paying $130/yr for personal and haven't been able to create a note for days! Cancel subscription button looking pretty good!!b"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote user from before 2012. Gets one star, only because I can't give it none. Price goes up and features disappear. Last straw... you can't search your notes when you are offline. So I'm going to scroll through thousands of notes to find my info. Dream on. Migrated my personal notes to Obsidian, work notes soon to follow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Back in ""legacy evernote"" days this used to be 5 star app and I was a loyal customer. But now - nope. Double no. 200% price increase in 2 years while the app has become slow and bloated. They apparently try so hard to become a ""business suite"" instead of ""notes organizer"" that they don't care about basic customers or basic notekeeping use cases. Moving on to other solutions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From 5 to to 1 star. Can't access any of my old notes since the update, seems like I'm being forced to pay now or I have to forfeit everything I worked on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app but recently has changed ownership and things have gone downhill. This app doesn't even include the most basic feature allowing you to print a note from your phone. I.have complained about this for a year. The development team should be embarrassed that they don't even have the skill level know how to program in a print function which is the most basic of features. Moving on to another note app with a competent development staff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forever error 500"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Many bugs with low customer satisfaction. Yall need to find better way to make profit. Apparently, turning a free note app into a paid one is not the right way forward :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lemot, ribet, disuruh bayar pula"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used to be a fantastic daily use tool. now sn expensive, barely functional note pad. I'll find a more user-friendly and intuitive solution when my current subscription comes to an end."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The new version works much better. It's sleek and fast and syncs much faster as well. Kudos bending spoons upgrading my former 2015 review from 4 to 5 stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost all my notes and now they want to charge me for a free account. Deleting it!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"2024: Nope. I can't take it any longer. I've migrated to UpNote. 2023: I keep coming back to Evernote, because half my brain is here. But my god, this Android app is nearly unusable. UX is just so. bad. I guess bugs are getting fixed, and features get added, but usability hasn't improved in years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Giving it a thumbs down for now because ""I can't capture a youtube clip"" issue is still present from 2021 and my workflow misses it severly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless at this point considering the better offering and features from competitor apps (i.e. OneNote, Notion). Also this paywall on the amount of notes and notebooks is a total killer!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Prompting me to sign up for a paid subscription every time I open a note. Garbage tier marketing and immediate uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ask me to go on a pay plan every single time I open the app. Sorry, you used to be the best, but now after 10 years I am leaving you because I don't need those other fancy functions on a pay plan or a pay reminder screen pops up and hard to close every time I open you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Productivity no-no. What's happened to my widgets? Opening page now full of what evernote wants me to do. Facetiously called ""your evernote"" Now constant nags about calendar: ""Try it now"" I don't use Outlook calendar, so really don't care. But can't turn off these nags. More productivity blocking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I'm not sure why this app has so many bad reviews. I have tried out about 12 different note apps and this is the only one that actually works well with the features I want. Only 4 stars though because premium is pricey (I haven't decided if I'm going to pay it yet) and after I put my payment info in for the trial, the limit was still enforced for a while."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A lot of advertisements and limiting functions from year to year"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One thing it is better than Notion... Evernote supports offline storage!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Can't long in from phone It wants me to get a verification code from email but when I switch apps it clears Evernote login progress and boots me back to main login screen. Have to login from computer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Back in August 2022, I gave Evernote a bad review with one star only. I had repetitively lost several notes due to a malfunctioning software. Yet... here I am, with Evernote still. Happy with the widget interface before, content with the current interface and overall functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have lost all my notes that were not sync during app update. Also app became really slow. I should look for an alternative. I am really pissed off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have a valid plan till Dec 2024 and now I can't use premium features. This happend after I resubscribed. I tried reinstalling and logging into."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Easy for use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great application 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using more than 5 years but now they asking charges for using this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went downhill with constant ads and limited free notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote. I've used this app for over ten years now, possibly as long as 15 years. I depend on it, with notes on various aspects of my life. Daily. But I can't rate it more than 3 Stars. Why? Because its developers annoyingly, tediously and relentlessly insist on trying to upsell me to buy their paid version. A decade-plus along, can't they tell that I'm okay, and just quit harassing me? You'd think… but NOPE. I wish they'd just let a guy live his life! Maintain the app and LAY OFF."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop shoving promotions in my face! Used to be my go to note app when I first got an android phone over 10 years ago. 1 notebook and 50 free notes is a joke really. Paid subscription is too much. Pops up every time I open the app trying to force me to pay to upgrade. Time for a new note app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's so sad that what used to be the best notes app has fall so low to the bottom because of their greediness."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Since the update its working better. Bit slow sometimes and I sometime have to click on objects more than once to get it to react"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Became too troublesome to use. The constant nagging to upgrade sealed the deal. Found another app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This went from one of best apps, to one of the most annoying. Have 3 ads to buy the dumb service every time you open the app is ridiculous. In the process of copying out my notes and deleting this junk app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app, and used for a long time for all my note taking needs. I liked that it had written and audio options, as well that it was backed up. However, they've updated to a subscription based platform and I'm well over the ""limit"" of notes for the free plan I guess - what. Not to mention the subscription is very pricey. I'm just trying to take random notes! So I'll have to go find another app to use, too bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I believe the free version allows up to 50 notes. I have only 29 notes, and I am unable to add any new notes. I would like to ask why that is?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The end of Evernote. Excessive monetization killed the app for me. Unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is now trying to force me to pay for a plan in order to create new notes. I even tried deleting older notes. After many years of usage, I guess I will be switching to another note app. Bye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too heavy, laggy, slow or whatever on Android (Poco X6 - Snapdragon 7s Gen 2)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would never recommend Evernote. It has become completely unusable without a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The new UI changes have been an improvement. The last major change made the app sluggish for me, and I rated it 2/5. I'm a little annoyed when they make big changes, but this one was worth it. However, they have priced me out recently, so I am leaving after over a decade of using Evernote, 7 years of which I was a paid user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even log in through my phone. Sign in through google sends you through the 2-step process and doesn't even sign-in to the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"have been using Evernote for over a decade, but will not be renewing my subscription this time. It was a great app but for some reason they have to keep changing it and making it worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Never developed print capability for Android users. Went up on price while failing to continue to sync to my Fire tablets. Major fail as an app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"dependable note app. worth paying for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Does exactly what it says on the tin: fast uploading too,although that may have more to do with my phone (Samsung Galaxy A8+)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is done 😂 Only thing left to do is export the notes to another app. So long Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Exceptional"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand this is a free version but it's very annoying having every time Popups appearing asking for paying for the upgraded version. Doesn't make me feel I want to but the paid version. I'll pass to something else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sync limitations"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too aggressive with their push to upgrade to a paid plan affecting user experience. Now no new notes are allowed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it has logged me out without any reason and now unable to login."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"your new policy limiting notes is absurd for user, good luck"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What did you guys do to the app? It takes forever to load notes. the notes are blank and don't load if I switch between apps. There's some weird glitch with going back and you can't see I'm over this. Besides limiting my notes over the years and the constant barrage of paid promotions to upgrade. I'm fed up and switching to OneNote after using you for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I don't really use it frequently but still i will give it a 4 star for it's work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's a useful app, but limits your access with the free version and filled to the brim with spam notifications. Every time you open the app there's at least three or four advertisements you have to click through asking you to purchase the premium version before you can access your notes. The app used to be better, but their new marketing strategy is aggressive and annoying. Will be transitioning away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New policy 👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use it to keep track of a very detailed and large Dungeons and dragons game, the various notes, notebooks and notebook sets make organizing an absolute dream!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great application, but in free version is hardly pushing you to buy it. Before you can start using it, it's necessary to close plenty of offers and adds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thank you for responding to users' feedback, the latest version has stabilised the issues that I was having with the app. I love this app and use it all the time for notes that I can access across devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Updates are done daily. Update must be collected throughout the month or at least weekly. And simplify the application as much as possible. That's how it would be better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Came back after a few years and it's gotten so much worse. It feels useless now with constant attempts to either have you buy something or forcing you to go through tutorials on how to use this useless app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I really loved this app. Then without warning it stopped working because I had reached the limit of the notes I could make (free version). I didn't even know it was limited."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good until it was behind a paywall. Now it's useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing the pay structure and locking users out is a terrible business model. Goodbye Evernote and hello Notion!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't log into my account! I tried even in another mobile device, and it gave the same results..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updates ruined my macbook!! Use another note taking app that doesnt brick so many devices with useless updates!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't even log in anymore? when it lets me verify it just asks me to log in all over again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It took a while to get used to the new layout but everything is snappier and more reliable. Well done Bending Spoons."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was once a great app but now it's awful. It's lagging, slow and the new layout is pointless. What the hell guys. Who approves this? Sack them, please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to app. Now forces an upwell everytime I open it and is buggy and unusable even after declining the purchase. Time to move on to a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the latest Android and Win versions, the data input is slow to synchronize with the device, and the image is often not displayed, which is worse than the 6.xx version. The new version, although the operation interface looks good, the experience is not satisfactory. 🥱🥱🥱"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will bombard you with pay subscriptions. App works great but not worth the grubbiness. It's just a notepad at the end of the day"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've paid for this app for so many months specifically to be able to use across multiple devices and I've never been able to add it to additional devices even though I've been paying for it :( Haven't been able to find how you can reach an actual PERSON for help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was my favorite note-taking app for MANY YEARS. Sucks now that they limited free notebooks to ONLY ONE?? When I have 20 over notebooks for so many years. This is a ripoff. They should expand the free notebooks to 8-10 at the very least to let ppl fully experience the app before paying. Now I have to face the annoyance of premium msg popping up EVERY SINGLE TIME I go into the app. Been tolerating this for many months. Time to find a new notebook app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really like this app for its ability to organize my life and keep it in sync between two devices. However, after changed the pricing, it become out of reach for me. While I love the app, I can't justify the cost. A monthly fee of $5-$8 would be reasonable, but at over $200 a year, it feels more suited to a CRM for businesses rather then just taken notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but it seems like everytime I open it now my amount of notes I can have is diminished. On top of that I get the pop-up to start a subscription before I can even go to my notes. I just downloaded a new app and transferred my notes over. I will be promptly deleting this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please don't use this app. Im using this from past 5 years.. Now or is been blocked my important data is saved in it.. They are asking me to pay 500/- now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can't use it anymore without at least 5 pop-ups asking me to subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No way this app to be useful for Free and you cant export notes to another app. This is so commercial centric way to push customers to subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ich schreibe auch gerne ""freundlich"". Diese App ist unbenutzbar geworden. Ich war über Jahrzehnte zahlender Kunde, bin es immer noch, aber das neue interface, die Bedienbarkeit sind unglaublich. Unglaublich schlecht und unbrauchbar. Ich bin schlichtweg wütend und enttäuscht. Finger weg, mehr kann ich nicht sagen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm having trouble adding Tumblr posts to Evernote, in that such operations take days to stick. This has been going on since 31-OCT-2019."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved Evernote UNTIL I saw the $129/year paywall??? I haven't needed EN in a while. I went to add info, and there is a paywall limit of 30 notes and 1 notebook. I have 139 notes now. EN was useful to organize my information. I don't need cloud services, cross device access, etc. Evernote duplicates many functions found in other apps. Sorry EN, I like your UI more, but for $129/year, I'll deal with it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A very powerful application for creating and organising notes. However, the free trial of 1 notebook and 50 notes is WAY too limited. For an application that prides itself on being able to freely organise notes, the fact that you cannot move notes from one notebook to another in the free trial means that prospective customers would not be able to experience the true power of Evernote. How can you expect them to want more of a feature if they don't realise that they need it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep forcing us to upgrade everytime we click on a note. it's not free anymore. it's not productive anymore. gonna change to other apps. Thnx BYE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They update it pretty much everyday, which sounds great... It however, makes downloaded notes not load. Big flaw when the app is used for lyrics at gigs. Makes me sad that I paid for it and interested in finding alternative options and ditching this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is the most money-hungry company of 2024, since they are the only ones that stille wants money for therir software.........a software, that STILL works like in the 80´s and nothing new has happened since.......they are miles behind every other app or software doing the same....and centuries behind microsoft. Shot your company down.....no one needs it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I open it, it wants me to upgrade. The number of notes I can use without paying a monthly fee seems to be dwindling. It's a note app...it's not worth a monthly subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their new policy restricting notes is absurd. Its a notepad. I bet I could write a basic one in a day. Also now the warning when opening the app conveniently doesn't respond when clicking 'ask me later' or 'use free trial'. So the only option is to activate a paid account. 8m not even sure what notes I had in the dang thing, but it'll be worth losing them to get rid of this piece of junk. My needs are like Windows 3.1 notepad. I'm not paying for that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be a five-star app. I used to love this app for organizing thoughts and to-do lists and the sync to desktop. Over last year or year and a half, popups and ads encouraging an upgrade to paid version have steadily increased. Today, I had three popups before I was able to open & edit a note. With the annoying popups and the weird wider line spacing inside notes, I'm done. Uninstalling and trying something new--or Samsung's basic note feature installed on phones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I only use the basic featues. Have been nice for many years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like the layout. But I can't sketch. When i want to draw a line, it only dot. Please fix the issue. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Holy price hike! Not worth it for me. Great app, but doubling the annual subscription price is just too much for what I use it for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All data lost after 8 years of use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"version 10.91.0 - Home screen is utterly useless. Just give me the list of Notebooks, and favorite links, when I open the App. This is a note taking system, please go back to simple GUI, or at leat give the option to deselect homescreen, widgets etc. Opening the App sometime takes forever, and sometimes it does not open at all. have used Evernote for a very long time, and still love the note taking functionality, and also love the Task functionality with tasks within a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this for years, but a recent update was forced and now I have lost my unsynced notes. They should have an option to make sure you sync all notes before forcing an update on you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"started when it was free and got trapped paying annual fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for over a decade, 2k+ notes. I don't care that it costs money now, I actually decided to pay for it long ago, didn't effect me. It just gets worse is my problem. I used to be able to easily add/delete/move audio recordings within a note, it used to record in a different format that i could export easily and WHY IS TEXT LOCKED TO 1.5 SPACING NOW? UI is getting clunkier and more cumbersome, service won't allow older versions to sync. Whatever, I'm out. FEATURE BLOAT."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote app on S23 ultra sketch note doesn't work. Full of bugs and unusable. But overall, I have been a user for many years, and I am grateful for reliable service. Thank you. / Got s24u, and finally, the app works fine with latest updates. I am increasing rating from 3 stars to 4. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update on 5june 2024- The app is just become worse. - I am using high end phone but it still work slow - I need to close a ton of pop ups whenever I open it & everytime I accidentally end up clicking on one of the popup which open its subscription plan page, which is very very IRRITATING & I can't get to my notes quickly. - There is no way I can turn off its rotation. It doesn't use default phone orientation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please update new version This new version very bad please update new version this version app start very slow and searching very slow please update new version i use 5-6 years but this version very bad please fix this problem and my duplicate note made problem this version please fix this problem and update new version please fix this issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Security breached everytime. This app was great at the time but now it's like a trash. Especially with the security and pop up. Do you need money so badly?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"i love evernote. A page for everything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Among the best for journaling and writing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Sketching is not working!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last time, you made part of my information unavailable, this time you destroyed my entire account! You are awful, awful >:("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They must be trying to run off their users. This app is a joke"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"what happened to this app. it's slow. unlike before. to many extras. all i want is a simple place to store my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be such a great app. Now it shows its greediness for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Listen to your user base. You screwed up. Fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I tried this app I saw many people giving this 1 rating I was like this is looking good app why are they giving 1 rating and bad review then I installed that app and after installing I know that why are they hating that app because when I open this app it has a option of sign in I click that option then the website opened on browser and my account was not log in and without log in you cannot use that app that's why I hate that app DO NOT DOWNLOAD 😡😡😡😡😡❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since update, app freezes on open, keeps suggesting payed subscription but isnt workable *at all*. No access to any note since app just doesn't work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a paid subscriber for over a decade and a half. The app keeps getting worse with the developers becoming more tone deaf while the service gets more expensive. I've given them so many tries. I was optimistic after their acquisition, and I've liked some of the tweaks recently. But the recent update, while aesthetically nice, is functionally terrible, esp the new un-customizable Home Page (e.g. ""Shortcuts"" which used to be present in the home screen, now take three taps just to get to!)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Charges me 20$ a mth for the past 8 years even after cancelling it. Refuses to reimburse or stop the payments. I even tried deleting the app. They still charge me 20$ per mth. Over $1,700.00 CAN dollars they have stolen. They are criminals. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fails to login on my Android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but the last month or so it has quit opening an attached file. Instead of working on a resolution like they said they made all my notes disappear until I paid. I had deleted most of my notes only leaving the most important because they said the free version would be limited. After 10 years of use you have lost all my business. I will tell those I have recommended you to to change apps asap. So disappointed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good app but the offer to become a paid user is coming too often, don't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best note app ever! 😁"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crushes all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The program is missing a crucial feature for me—the ability to crop images in non-rectangular shapes. Often, documents aren’t captured straight on; they’re rotated or skewed. Microsoft OneNote and OneDrive excel in this regard, handling document scans perfectly. This limitation is the primary reason I cannot use Evernote and must instead rely on OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer has a reasonable lite/free option as a note taking app. $129 a year? Get Lost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost my all notes. Dont download it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this was a very useful toll for my Sakura school simulator videos!for scrips❤️ that's it for my 5 star explained"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for 10 years and I'm deleting it. All they want is your money. I can no longer crate new notes with out paying, the basic function of a note app. Save yourself the trouble and just use Google docs for your notes. TRASH COMPANY. TRASH ETHOS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad app after recovery email sent it was not able to sent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good app. Helpful, clean interface and accessible. However, app does lag and crash and £7/month is a ridiculous price point for personal use. Update: they've reduced the allowable storage. Initial complaints still stand."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please don’t use it... They sell your data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Over time the app has gotten worse, it no longer updates between my phone and the server, can't make new notes, and is glitchy as all hell. The updates make things worse instead of better in regards to housing the actual note app, like they added a ""/"" function as a shortcut but now you can't type / in text and keep going without the app thinking you're going for a shortcut. Really frustrating and as the quality worsens, they push more ads for you to get premium on a failing product..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"High price for adding notes, it ain't worth the money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"way to make pop-ups and alerts, just let me see my data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Now free version is an absolute pain. Also the ui degraded over time. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be one of the best app for note making, using it over many years now. But it has become painful to use since they have moved to offering premium. The ads are painful, the changes in UI are also too frequent. I understand they need to make money through ads and premium buy when most notes apps are for free, why would someone pay this much. But the pricing should have been more reasonable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using the app for more than a decade, I see I'm obligated to pay an yearly fee if I want to create more than 50 notes. I'll quickly look for an alternative and uninstall this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has become freaking useless and it has broken every promises they made for the free version basically for more money. Goodbye finding another app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was best earlier but now it is worst. Looking for alternative and how to export it's data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app deserves negative rating. You just can't see pics uploaded in notes in landscape mode. Pathetic UI. Poor navigation. No control."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable without a paid subscription. Keeps nagging about paying for subscription almost every time the app is opened, which get in the way of actual note taking. I've been a long time user and suddenly there's strict limits enforced on how many notes can be created and how big a note can be. That mean that I can no longer create new notes without clearing up hundreds of old ones, or paying for a subscription. Evernote used to be the gold standard of note taking, now it's just sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update, while visually appealing, is slower than what was already quite a laggy app - and has also removed the notes widget I've been using for years... Edit 3 years later: wow it got even worse. I for a while had installed an old apk but recently got blocked that it wouldn't let me use it anymore..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The discount offering is always popping up. it is very annoying that it doesn't have a ""don't show this again"" button. was forced to switch to other apps because of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dropping review until functionality is restored. Going from a customisable home page of widgets, to a forced page (without a notebooks link) was a poor choice. Now my widget screen is still available with a few clicks, yet no option to make it my default screen. Frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy. The fact that I'm constantly barraged by paywalls or having to choose a device to unsync login usage is depressing. Please avoid using at all costs, and this is from someone who's been using this for 5 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I rarely use this anymore - it's just become far too complicated and annoying to use when all I want to do is save notes and scan documents with my phone. I used to love Evernote too..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app just gets worse with every upgrade and the number of nag screens are unbelievable. Every time you start the app you have to jump through hoops to dodge the nag screens. I would suggest looking for alternatives - I finally moved to Google keep notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for almost everything, all my recording and writing projects, sensitive documents and audio files for my kids' custody case, pictures, notes, receipts, website captures, EVERYTHING. I log in today to find an old story I wrote, and *every single thing* has been wiped. My password was FINE. Before they erased YEARS worth of WORK, I would have given it 5 stars, but I know I'll never get it back because these companies are greedy and don't care. Stay away from them. Zero stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Bloated and sluggish. I've used Evernote since 2011 and it has grown increasingly heavy and unwieldy over the years. I often find myself at a standstill waiting for notes to load. Unreliable syncing between devices. Really disappointing that Evernote can't l seem to keep up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They made compulsory pay to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great AND FREE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit OR $130 per year? Joke is on me for even downloading this app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used for years. Used to absolutely adore it and it's ease of use. Now it is completely unusable, unorganized, and wants you to pay to have notes. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Verybad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App stopped working, upgraded and all notes gone...you can procreate with yourself if you think I am paying now you COST ME MONEY Mellon Farmer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To much annoying ads to make you purchase premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely broken in 2024. Unable to login from Android at all. Support is provided by unresponsive bot. Do not even think to spend money on this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too hard to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless. Can't login to access my old notes 👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this App for eight years but unfortunately this is it. The latest update & UI change has made this app glitchy, slow, and full of bugs. The simple text notes won't even open, can't do anything, and on top of that it keeps on showing pop ups for paid version. Good-bye, uninstalling it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good, but overpriced. You get fifty free files, but after that, it is over 100 dollars yearly. I don't use it enough to justify paying that much, but it's less about the price and more about how the app asks you to subscribe every time you open it. There is no opportunity to decline, so you have to go through the subscription process only to decline at the end in order to actually use the app. It has gotten so frustrating that I've been thinking about moving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"[Edit] I downloaded this app a long time ago, and it was excellent. Unlimited notes, unlimited notebooks, a pleasure to use. This ridiculous subscribe garbage has me looking for a new notebook app for my phone. 5☆ down to 1☆ [/edit] This app has made my writing so much easier while I am on the go or just sitting at home. I don't think I would be half as far with my book without it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Could you guys make this app any worse? My password is too weak? So I need an email, even though the password is CORRECT you send an email to a dead email address because I've been using this for 10+ years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly reminding me of the premium option, not to mention the issues with synchronization across devices. Sadly switching to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Recent update fixed most of the problems I was experiencing. Thank you;"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This application same like logo eliphent working too much slow I try to find another application 😕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a great app for both making notes and sharing notes between people via the app if needed. However, they've just decided to throw everything out the window and not only make paying for notes an option (more like mandatory), but capped you note limits for the amount of notes made in totality to force you to pay. Also, every other click you make on your notes has an ad show up, so they must be down horrendous for some money. Do better, EverNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep making changes and breaking other parts of the app, it's crazy how an app that's been around this long and has this many users can be this badly designed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Imposible to use, they push about 4 notification sfor subscriptions and other junk every time you want to open a damn note. Will switch to another free app. Last thing will do is pay for a basic notes app that should be free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once great, but has now become totally inundated with ads. Find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been unable to sign in - when I put my email it just does nothing. The log in page doesn't move beyond the email bit. I paid for premium and I can't even get to my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Almost no free features. Too expensive subscription for what it is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost years of notes. I pay for it, but it just started giving me an error message across all devices. The trouble code they give is useless, there's zero tech support by phone, mail, or email. The FAQs are useless. It's basically a scam at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a member since 2013. They've recently limited free users to the # of notes. The paid version is VERY expensive & as an existing user I had lots of notes. It froze me out until I brought down the # of notes to their new limit. As frustrating as it was to downsize, I realize they need to make money, however, I am now being inundated with ads promoting paid plans. I feel I have 2-3 ads every time I log in now. This is the first time since 2013 that I've considered looking elsewhere :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"App becomes more easy to use, esp picture save mode. Picture of object cannot be taken shapely if the contrast environment of the object is more expose than object itself."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used this app for over 5 years and after some times I got back to check some old notes and everything has been wiped... like my evernote was empty like I didn't write anything lol. W update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I was finally getting used to v.10. It doesn't sync reliably but still basically works. And then the new version appeared with a new UI. The home page no longer has widgets and thus serves no purpose. It's just more clicks between me and my notes. Worst of all though is the new permanent Browse menu at the top of the note list. Now I can see 3 notes without scrolling when I used to be able to see 10, and there's a huge,intrusive, unnecessary, uncollapsible menu at the top of my notes. WHY?????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Колись це була гарна програма для збереження нотаток, але зараз вона перетворилась у суцільний рекламний потік із вимоганнями платні за невідомо що. Нахіба ця програма потрібні за гроші я ніяк не можу знайти для себе відповідь. Зараз в інеті достатньо схожих програм безкоштовно."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app got renewed. It is terrible. The focus is in tasks and calender instead of notes. Evernote is notebook, not a freaking calendar!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice app, very nice 👍."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot login for Android. The multifactor screen redirects back to the login page when I try to get my authenticator code. Support said I should try turning off multifactor. They should have just suggested that I should try a better note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new changes to Evernote seen to be trying to change the point of the app and the price increases to match. I've used Evernote almost since it first came out for note-taking, journaling, and writing. It now seems to want to be a different kind of app that I don't need and don't want to pay over twice as much for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love the app. Everything is clear and well structure"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"evernote.....thuuuiii....creating only for money...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please help this company go bankrupt by switching to notion or ms notes. Stupid UI change that made it unusable. Unstable and keeps crashing. Absolutely horrible charging your loyal users for just adding an additional note? There are so many alternatives in 2024 why should anyone stick with this POS app? Who made this idiotic decisions when there are so many options to monetize on loyal customers? Let's help this company sink faster by switching out and closing accounts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Didn't think this is even possible but this app is getting even worse than it was. Unusable on phone or tablet. They add some dumb stuff nobody asked for like tasks or calendar instead of fixing that what this app should be mainly used for - Notes! If you don't remember, it's called EverNOTE! I'm moving to something else because I honestly don't know what I'm paying for. I wouldn't use it now even for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was hoping for an app that would allow me to take pictures of a whiteboard and compile them in a notebook. This app should be able to do that... It's a simple thing to ask. However, doing any editing like cropping, deleting images, or adding text below images is totally unmanageable with this app. It's a nightmare"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash since it's subscription based now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updates have led to notes turning themselves unavailable while I'm in the middle of editing them and a lot of my recently added content being deleted. I otherwise love the core functionality of the app when it's functioning appropriately. But this is an unforgivable bug. I've also got a problem with the new home page and UI. I frequently reuse the same set of notes and it now takes more interactions to get to thesenotes. I'm paying a substantial subscription for the service to be this poor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just logged in after a while and apparently now I can only access one notebook with 50 notes unless I pay. When I have time I will use the free trial to copy and paste each of my notes into Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to log into new version with 2fa enabled. Unusable now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have a problem with evernote, it suddenly closed and i cant see my notes any more!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything was gone and all the saved data terminated"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled since I could not open it . I used to love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"good product but just pricey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Should have deleted this app forever ago. When I first installed it, there was a decent amount of free notes that could be created. They eventually changed where you can only make a very limited amount of notes. The most annoying part is they would ask every single time you would open the app to upgrade. Somehow, hackers were able to add their devices to my account. It was very frustrating trying to remove their devices. I'm concerned about security risks, so I deleted my account. Feels good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed and frustrated after reading other people's comments I can't join"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New home screen dramatically reduces usability"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In last update the app became unbelievably slow, I need to wait 10+ seconds to open any note or change menu, it's ridiculous. And all that after awful update where the great main page with widgets was replaced by useless menu where you need a lot more effort to find and open the note you need, and it was explained as to ""reduce loading times"". I have yearly subscription and was using Evernote for years. And now it became unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!! It USED to to be wonderful but not anymore. If I could give this app less than 1 start I would! So frustrated they have changed. Pop ups, wanting to charge me for what used to be free. No longer add notes, half of what I had doesn't work anymore. I'm moving my notes over to another app, which will take days to do. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote after 15 years. Its became a UI hell for now. I need to push ""cancel"" in adv screens about 4-6 times before i can edit my notes. I didn't think this was an app for hand-finger coordination training."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Please give at least 3 device (desktop, laptop, mobile) sync for free account? 🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. After most recent update, none of my information is there. Seems to ""load"" upon each open. Time to Uninstaller and find a good app. Not sure how bad you have to be to mess up a simple list app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using it for 10 years, I'll have to find another app. Finally with the last edition, that they said was ""made with S2"", the app is basically unusable, give the bugs, glitches, screen closing out of the blue, app shutting down, even a notebook I use the most disappearing from the ""move to"" option... not to mention that the last layout is bad. So sad. I always used the premium version and used a lot, for over 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time user, and with the recent conversion to a paid model, the app has become completely unusable with continuous ads asking for your money. I've removed all info and deleted my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been a long time user of Evernote and I'm pleased to see the evolution, changes and progress with the new management team. keep it up and I'll stay for a long time. thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Has really gone down hill under bending spoons. UX is high friction for people who want to take and manage notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you have made this very difficult to use. why must I be required to sign in each time I use this s app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to prefer this app. Now, they have gone pathetic with their greed! Notion is far better option now!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Recent updates have improved the app a lot, thanks! Still needs the sync button back, but overall much more stable performance and intuitive interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have you people lost your minds? 129 a year for a note taking app. It was so nice when free and you must not have any brains to figure out a way to make money and keep it free. I'm gone forever. You would make a ton more if it worked properly and had a one time purchase of like $10. 129 per year with a 3 start rating. Get real"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop telling me to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Same as many other people. I'd used the free version for years and it did everything I needed it to do. Recently it logged me out and wanted me to subscribe. I had info that I really needed in those notes. I did a free trial so I could get my notes and transfer them to another app. I got an email saying that I'd be charged in a few days if I didn't cancel. I followed the link and canceled. Now I see that I'm being charged anyway. Trying to get a refund now. We'll see."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app give you the semblance of having a free plan, but everything is limited. 50 notes and 1 notebook limit, only 2 devices can be synced. Less than 5 minutes into using the App, and I'm prompted to subscribe because of 1 limitation or the other. How am I able to make a decision to subscribe if you do not let me breathe for the first five minutes of using your app. I believe the only people willing to use this app are those who got this on strong recommendations - but not me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app got progressively worse over the last several years, and then recently they gutted the free plan. Which wouldn't be so bad, except there are constant pop-ups asking you to switch to the premium plan. The app is less usable now because it's basically a big advertisement. If they wanted everyone to pay to use the app, they could have just communicated that? Instead of offering a free plan that constantly bothers you to upgrade? Evernote leadership making some baaad decisions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was the best. Now you can't go 30 seconds without getting a modal popup asking you if you want to buy the new garbage they've made. As a user for >10 years all of a sudden not being able to create new notes is garbage. Great retention play there. Avoid at all costs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They force you to make a subscription and they don't let you take your notes and move to another provider without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be really great until it forces for an upgrade to create new note, even though I don't have 50 notes yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"No complaints, love the app have done for years can be used for so much more than notes, however we've got calendar access now and I was wondering if that being the case we could get a calendar widget too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App always starts at the top of the file. That makes it useless to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using Evernote for almost ten years. It used to be a great app that bacame bloated and virtually useless in the free version. Constant bombardments with overpriced upgrade ""offers"" are the last nail in the coffin. Switching to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This my daily go-to app across all my devices. Easy to organize in Notebooks but too difficult to print or transfer contents."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recently resubscribed and it was a mistake. This app used to be efficient, now it's somehow simplified and more cluttered at the same time. Very few customizable settings for the actual app. So poorly optimized for tablets. Limited pen support and no options with how it interacts with the app, it's reduced to handwriting-to-text in every instance aside from the non expandable sticky notes widget. I paid $100 for my stylus, do you think I'm going to waste my time on an app I can't use it in?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unacceptable Price Increase. Used to pay $40 a year and they now want $170 at the next renewal. Time to cancel and move to something better. If this is how you treat long time subsribers I hope your business model fails miserably."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have hundreds of notes on here. Easily organized and retrievable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has turned to trash. It feels like spamware and is even less useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"FIX MY SUBSCRIPTION BUG GUYS. IT IS PAID FOR."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I could no longer login to my account using the app. Please help. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App not working right anymore. While trying to open a note, I get either spinning or a popup for a new feature that can't be closed. Please fix. There are so many similar apps to pick instead of Evernote. Take away ease of use, and I am out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've used Evernote for maybe a decade and have found it to be great. However this aggressive move to make a profit has made it largely unusable unless you agree to pay their subscription model, which is expensive for what it is. Therefore sadly I find myself looking for an alternative for the first time ever. There are lots around - you do not have to pay this much for what is ostensibly a mobile notepad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to use evernote at all. Plz help. Widgets don't work. Will hang"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Android app keeps crashing as of last few months, repeated prompts to pay a subscription fee. Shame as I've used the app for nearly 10years, have just moved to a different platform"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now dreadful. Constant nagging to pay an extortionate subscription. Irritating new interface that keeps making suggestions and getting in the way. Not intuitive. Really annoying. Uninstalling and going to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is one of the worst applications ever to store your notes. I lost my account for no reason and I couldn't access it after not accessing it for years. It became dormant and for reason I couldn't log into it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best productivity tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user, the new free version of this app is completely unusable. Every time you open a note it hits you with two advertisment screens you have click through to get to your content. This app use to be so much better. Now it's useless for the nonsubscriber. RPG Notes is a much better platform, automatically creates hyperlinks to other notes with the same title, is free to use as much as you like and a modest donation gets rid of adds forever. Evernote, take note on how a great app works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing for writing, now it's 99 dollars for a yearly subscription. Don't use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another case where an app pretends to be free. After getting all comfortable you will be greeted with a message after a few days of use stating that you may only have 50 notes and 1 notebook. After this point you can't create more notes, rendering the notebook app useless. Frustrating, if you spent a few hours tidying everything. Wasted my time, don't waste yours."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is wrong with you, new owners?! Have you seen reviews for the last couple of months? I would understand if this was some trivial wallpaper app or something like that. SOME PEOPLE'S WORK DEPENDS ON EVERNOTE. Horrible new layout. Just horrible. I've been paying for this app for so long. Edit: app is now completely broken, can't open stacks, can't open notebooks. Unbelievable. This was my daily driver for like 10 years now. FIX THIS ASAP, and BRING BACK the previuos user interface!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Best. Note. App. Ever. UPDATED: since the huge overhaul that happened several years ago Evernote has been struggling to even be functional. They seem to be trying to improve with bug fixes and updates but it's still not quite there yet. Still buggy and not up to par the way it used to be. I hope they continue to improve."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"says my current plan allows me 50 notes and a notebook. I only have 6 notes after deleting a few old ones and it won't let me create anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"2024 updated review. The latest version has improved a lot. Kudos to the team. One question, why can't you enable pasting from the Clipboard, a very basic feature? Copy and paste only from the last action is counter intuitive, and that cost you 2 stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a scam, do not install or your data is lost and go for simple apps that do your basic needs, this will keep interfering with unnecessary data changes and ended up losing my data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is fine if you ask me for subscription when I first open the app. But it is not okay if you ask me to get subscription on every note I click! That's very annoying!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive. Free version too restrictive. Backed up everything and deactivated the account I had since 2014. So disappointing the way these apps gouge everyone. If I could rate ""no stars"" I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free tier only 50 notes! And if you want to pay, you gotta dish out 150 a year for a damn note taking app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for over 10 years. It's only gotten worse over time. The recent releases are Incredibly buggy and unstable on Samsung tablets and recent android versions. Crashes constantly and is slow when it does work. I'm probably going to have to switch apps."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my go to notes app for a long time, I use to be able to write a note on my phone and open it on my computer. Now I have to pay to do that, and I have to pay if I want to have more than 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"subscription is too costly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access Evernote through the app or web on my iPad or my Android phone. I'm using a supported browser & OS. I get an error message when I try to log in, saying it's having trouble loading Evernote (on the web) & won't even let me enter a password on the app. I'm a PAID subscriber and can't even get into it from any device using app or website.

You close the AD, because you just want to write it down: Another AD! You close the second ad, try to open another notebook: Nope! You're over the limit: AD!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor security"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The downfall to hell of a once such great app... Very slow, very buggy, organized sooo poorly, lots of options that I don't need, and the ones I need are difficult to access. I have an account with the free version, and each time before opening a note I get a popup forcing me to re-select the free version or paid one. I also have a paid account for my company, and after years of Evernote, I am now looking for an alternative to move both of my accounts. Using this app now makes me sick."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"App is fine but there is a problem with shortcut. It's not showing the tasks I created on home screen shortcut. Please support me to solve this problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The recent update have vanished the smoothness. It is now taking long response time, search are not proper and comes back to top of notebook everytime whenever I exit any the note (so have to scroll back downwards everytime). I hope these problems would be resolved in new update. Thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can someone tell me why the F this app closes my note every time I look away for a minute? Say I go to look something up on my browser & come back a min later...my note is closed?? Then it takes nearly a minute to get back to where I was! NOT VERY EFFICIENT AT ALL! IN FACT, VERY FRUSTRATING! How is it that the paid app in 2024 is WORSE than the free app I was using 10 years ago? So very sorry that I paid for this app!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"13 Years of use and now the android interface is terrible. Why would Evernote change this. I'm sure we will see change or even an option to revert back to the old interface. This app went from an inexpensive, highest rated app to an expensive app with mediocre reviews which are dropping fast. Please see these reviews as constructive because you had something good here for many years and now, not so much. I'll be backing up and roaming for the next best thing unless I see change like others."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"don't like the new updated version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Got too expensive for me. I'm going to use free version for now and the change to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"with the new update it takes a long time to load. once loaded it takes about 10-15 seconds for a note to open once I click on it. this app used to be much faster and more pleasant to use. weirdly, when I click on the trash icon I find all of my notes there, not just the ones I disposed of."

I loved this app. Now however, they are trying to charge me $129.99 a year for something that has been free for years. Screw this.

I'm using a Galaxy S9 and I am using the most updated version of Microsoft edge for my internet. In the description for the app it does say that my phone is compatible with the app. I am still able to use the web version on my regular home computer. But the whole reason I started using Evernote was for my cell phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was the best free note taker before. Now it takes a minute to load and shows 2 ""buy our plan"" ads every start. Disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update ruined the app. Unusable on Android. Does not retain the login session at MFA challenge when switching apps to retrieve MFA code.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I did love this app till the following happened , I'm a paid user, the app has become super slow absolutely disgusting and also the latest update had done away with the home screen and added a useless user interface.

App in decline for years. Crashes often. Dev slow. Now new acquirer charging exorbitant fee for basic functions. Willing to pay around $12/year for basic with recovery- but Personal NOT worth $130/year! Now has nothing I can't get from MS OneNote ""free"". So started migrating MANY years of notes. Goodbye Evernote. It was fun while it lasted."

Every time I enter my password and go through the 2-stage Google authentication screen it sends me back to the login screen as if I never entered anything. I've had Evernote on at least four devices and never had this problem before. Website login doesn't work either, even through a recently updated Chrome browser it says it's a browser issue. Infuriating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Impossible to login with 2fa because app asks to login from scratch once I switch to my 2fa code generator and back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app. It was the best note taking app and was so useful. But some new update changed the layout which sucks and now it's glitching all the time.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I, like other users described, lost all my notes in the most recent app update. The app would not let me log in, and I had to uninstall and reinstall. When I opened the app, all of the notes on all my accounts were gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't let me login. It asks me to select a profile (Google) but never get past the login screen. I've tried reinstalling & restarting my Chromebook without success. The website works but if I don't have an internet connection, I'd like a freestanding app, too. Any assistance would be appreciated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't access my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely awful. Bending spoons broke this app. When bending spoons bought Evernote they fired the entire Evernote team. They do not have customer support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a customer over a decade. Product and service just continues to get worse and worse. I think I'm just about done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent redesign means the app is slow to start and buggy. Why do links not open in an external browser anymore. Most of the time they do not open. Pushing of premium 'sale price' happens to oftern and is very annoying. Update - it got worse. I now can't edit notes immediately when opening them. They require opening and closing multiple times before being able to edit. Edit: May 24. It's now even worse. Slow. Hard to find what you need. Sorting doesn't work. Avoid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"really like the app. very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved evernote but the new update is just whack.! I mean if youre gonna shove an update in the face of the user, why not make it worth updating for. Search results wont load and the design is another one obstacle in the way. Like i just want to write a note and be able to find it when i want it, that's it, why is it cluttered with so many options.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years. Recently Evernote changed almost everything. I absolutely hate Evernote now. I have been exploring other options and was surprised by how many others are actually out there. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to have a home, now I have kage, useless Icons pointing to nothing I need. what gives?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"USED to be a great app, which is why I paid for it for many years now. I don't understand why we lost the ability to easily do what we need to do. Everything is so convoluted now and you have to go through more steps. If we have to keep this mess I seriously doubt I will be paying for it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Look at everything, everything is paid and if you use the free one, it constantly offers to switch to a paid plan. It's terribly infuriating. There are a lot of analogues, I’m deleting them and don’t intend to use them anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app since 2017. Yesterday it says log again. I logged with my email that i already used to evernote. Then i loghed in after that every my notes are gone. Nots that i kept for 7 years. All gone. Really disappointed. Dont trust this app. Not recommended 👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful latest interface. Slow while scrolling the notes and after opening one note, the scroller went back to the top. Who design this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app has improved greatly since its terrible state after the rewrite. It now feels professional & useable again, instead of being a constant battle, & the recent UI improvements are a plus. Kudos to dev for this commendable rescue from whatever that was before. Changing 1 star to 4, & cautiously recommending again. Please add a setting to Android web clipping function to allow the option to default to ""simplified"" rather than web clip format, so we don't have to manually ""simplify"" each one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor support for paying customers, search functionality is not intuitive and not handy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version of this app used to great - the features I needed and easy to use. However, the recent change to constantly push for upgrading to a paid tier is extremely off-putting because it severely impacts my productivity when using this app. I would not mind paying a modest amount for usage, however, the paid version is much too expensive for the very few features I need in a note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used the app for years. A real shame that features are removed, made worse, shifted over to the premium version or just made unstable seemingly every other update. Just try out the alternatives, I haven't looked back since I uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly hassles now to pay and has deleted hundreds of notes luckily they weren't essential. Use you phones note book! It's free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Girish Nath Trivedi's"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bloated!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update is not userfriendly and not suitong the need. Worst Priduct thinking and unnecessary update instead focus on bug fixing and making it more lightweight. Thinking of cancelling the subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need previous version back. Worst update. Need quick access to recent notes and notebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this app for many years. Recently try to use the task widget. It works for 2 days and now not able to load the task list cited connection issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NEVERNOTE. I was an OG since before 2010 and when they changed their products literally overnight, they offered me nothing but spam. Now with years of notes, i was forced to upgrade. After months of trying to migrate using Google keep, I was finally able to Import everything to notion quickly and easily. deleted my account and uninstalled with utter joy. I'm clearly not your customer. It's like they are trying to burn Evernote to the ground and clearly purge all the deadwood customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for over a decade and as a full subscriber. The latest update has made it impossible to navigate to my to do list and looking at my options. In its new format it not usable for everday use. Please fix it. It's now infuriating. I have had to change my To Do list to 1Todo to search for it easier. But as there are no longer shortcuts it's infuriating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"pricey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My password protection has disappeared. How do I reset it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bloatware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and have loved it but i hate this new interface of the app as it actually makes it much more difficult to sort through my notes. To make matters worse now i can no longer save articles from websites. When i try to save anything it just attempts to load and the screen dims like its going to do something but then nothing ever happens to save anything to my evernote account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Probably the best note-taking app and they still are relevant and useful and continue to add new features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love the app, but recently the stability has decreased. In addition the billing system is not reliable, I was supposed to pay 59€ a year but realised they were still taking me 12€ a month. Opened a ticket to the support with proofs and activity logs showing it is a bug on their side. They haved denyied and now are ignoring my request. That's too bad, I don't want to leave but I might."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have had Evernote since High School. It has been my favourite note organizer but everything about the current update is horrible. I'm giving it two stars because you can stack notebooks that maybe you currently don't need, the scratch pad and the date thingie too is amazing. But it's no longer as functional as it used to be. I used to be able to access my notes even when I was offline now I can't, I have to wait for endless loading, and that it is useless when in a area with bad signal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest version seem to have broken the task widget?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's great even if I now have to pay for it. It's got all the nifty stuff one needs to keep their life in check."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for about 15 years. It used to be my favorite now things have changed. I've always used it for free now every single time I use it I'm prompted multiple times to pay for a plan. Another issue is I can no longer add a new note. I will have to pay to add any new notes. It says I have 50 notes. Prompting to upgrade to Premium. I deleted a bunch of notes now I have 45 notes but it won't recognize this and no matter what I do it says I have 50. To get around this I recycle notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today I change my rating, from 5 become 1. I payed for this licensed. I can not find my many notes. But when I opened on my Evernote on Mac, I can find it. If I want to find the note that's not appeared, I have to use ""Search"" feature. That's silly service.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dejare de ussar esta app. La he tenido por mucho tiempo ahora quieren cobrar. Y no dejan ver la.informacion que tengo guardada aqui esto ea una forma de robo. Lo siento no la usare mas. Aunque pierda mi info. 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New interface is terrible and all of my notes since last December disappeared. I use Evernote for work and just lost 6 months of mileage that I should be getting paid for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's almost laughable that they would release the software like this. Also a long time paid user. I don't mind the update an improvements, they are welcomed, but how is it that the homepage still exists yet it's not accessible anywhere on the new layout? Hope a fix is coming soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely obnoxious application that prompts for payment at every turn. This used to be the go to note organizer, but there's much better alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used it for a number of years, but I think, the company steers it in a wrong direction. The pages are being constantly refreshed, and, on fast WiFi, refreshes may take a minute or longer. Often I have to close the page and re-open it. The Android app suffers from its own ills. The web and the app used to be much better. I could use the web views offline without a problem (as long as I don't edit). No more. I am considering quitting Evernote, but still wating to see"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nonstop begging to upgrade. Now freezes whenever you open the app on top of a ""suggestion"" of different features that does not respond to tapping anywhere on screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every update gets worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's improving but still doesn't have feature parity with the desktop version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have personally used Evernote for years, i havent used it for a long time since i changed my phone. I just redownloaded the app to get the old notes, and now i cant use it unless i PAY? I just need to export my notes from my two older devices, that's all i need! What can i do in this case? Please let me know so i can give the app 5 stars instead of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Below one star, because I cannot use free apk any more they are forcing me all the time to buy purchased version, I will delete this poor apk and change to something new. Good bye."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using Evernote since 2010. This year, the home screen on Android mobile keeps changing. Now the reminder tab/view/list is gone.

I've used Evernote since 2013 & the REMINDERS function is the backbone of the system allowing me to stay on top of what needs doing and when - without it, Evernote is now essentially useless. Does ANYONE know whether this is simply a broken update (which may be fixed in the near future) or a feature that has been removed?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update moved notes to page 2 and now displays them date created even if you choose to display from date updated. It used to be such a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app happily for years but now I cannot login to my account with email only. It wants me to sign with either Google or Apple account. VERY UNHAPPY. Not to mentioned that they've been very aggressive to make me upgrade from a free account to very expensive one. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lots of bugs: 1. While writing a note the keyboard randomly closes mid-sentence 2. I cannot save new notes occasionally. I then have to restart the app and lose everything in the process. update: even 2 years later this app is a buggy mess. if anything it's gotten worse. prices also increased. time to say goodbye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stay away from Evernote. Their most recent update has made it unusable on Windows; even just typing takes forever now. This follows a long pattern of them adding bells & whistles while gutting basic functionality."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Here to downgrade my 5-star review of nearly a decade ago. Evernote used to be almost a daily part of my digital life. Recent changes disallow me from creating any new notes without absurd fees, so I'm compelled to abandon Evernote. A pity."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great application, but to throw a 71% price increase on it ludicrous. It's been $70 a year and now jumping up to $119.99/year with nothing that validates that kind of a price leap. I don't know what I will move to, but this is way too expensive for a notes app that syncs between devices. No thanks..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app in the past, but with the new updates, every time you open it, they push for a membership sale. If you opt to continue with the free version, they log you out. My advice: steer clear of this application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why do you keep moving stuff around every other month? Just leave the UI alone and work on adding useful features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"with out paid account, the application is not working. only one note is possible as femo. they do jock from us. do not recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used this app all the time because it had all the features that I wanted. Multi-Device sync, home screen widget, browser access, organizational tools. It has steadily gone downhill since they introduced AI. Before I found utility with the AI they already wanted to charge me more. And now the app is consistently broken, bad implementation of the new features. Went from fast and easy, to impossible to use. Very sad. Had to switch apps which illuminated another flaw. Data Format incompatibility"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recentemente o aplicativo tá horrível"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"5/13/24. Not any better and now app is rebranding with 3rd or 4th party logos. Not sure where this company is headed. Writing is on the wall, better start looking elsewhere. 8/1/2021 update: product updates are decreasing usable functions. Not liking you as much as I did. Took all stars away This is was the best note taking app on the market. Images not syncing and showing errors across different devices. Lost another star..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Needs help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New Interface deployed April 2024 is very Inefficient. You can find the orginial home screen hidden under ""My Widgets"" but I can't find anyway to set as default openning screen. Another issue is the constant updates & lack of folder view. Bending spoons seems appropriate name for the application designer, take something that very functional and wreck it. The update issue not only with the Android client but also the Windows client. Both client use to have snappy performance but not any more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for 2-3 years and suddenly last week it got logged out and not able to login again and all the data is gone. Pathetic experience, if i would have known this no one would have ever try to save their data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"expensive not user friendly. lacks many features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others are saying in 2024, it was great, used it for years, now it's very poor. For me the breaking point was it refusing to let me write a new note because it said I had too many. I removed many notes to another app until I got below the number it says I was allowed and still it wouldn't let write a new note. At that point it was easy to move my remaining notes and delete Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used this app primarily for offline notes and very rarely accessed them online. Lately, the app just spams me with upsells and limitations that are hard to X out of and also logged me out, offering a generally poor user experience. Unless you need all the extra features and want to pay for something you can probably get for free elsewhere, I no longer recommend Evernote. The company seems desperate to cash in on its free users. It's certainly pushing me away from using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Go elsewhere. Was a great app. They are now a paid app and the amount they want is ridiculous. If their price was reasonable I'd consider it, but they want more than an Amazon subscription. Moving all my notes to a competitor, who has reasonable rates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was, by far, my favorite notebook app. Now it's trash. Paid MONTHLY subscription or you get 50 notes total and one singular notebook. I've used this app since 2011 and I'm moving everything over to Google docs because this user experience is literally the worst."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"in the past few years has gotten less user friendly and less secure, and more expensive. would like to option to mass download pdfs of notes and turn of ai help,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The App is great, but recently it closed every time I open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer using this app. It just didn't work well on my s23 ultra. Version 10 is very flaky"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"130 bucks a year just to keep digital notes lmfao."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using Evernote for years, have saves so much of my notes there but now it keeps on crashing and can't even log in. Says I should contact support everytime I try. What has happened to such an amazing app? Kindly fix it because it is taking a toll on so many people as I can see."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New UI update is awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too expensive and new interface is bad. I will be transferring my notes to another FREE app and uninstalling Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thank"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy company. It used to be great. Now they don't care how long you've been using their app. All they care for is money. Deleted this garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yet another update that totally broke the app. When we go the notes lists, notes are sorted randomly with very old notes coming up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A once great app turned worse. Charging permium for creating notes, one of the most basic feature of a note app is scummy business practices. I understand locking other features behind a premium but the most basic feature of creating note. WoW. Another good app down the drain. Going to uninstall and will use the phone's default note app. This is sad as this was such a nice app in the past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it really help with notes really useful reasonable price 10 out of 10"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I generally like the app, but after the last update I can't get back my home page as I had it before where I had all the widgets at hand, I have to go through the settings to find my shortcuts, I am very annoyed by this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why the app is forcing to get premium I'm seeing premium ad repeatedly it's annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a new user. I would like continue using this. But the Monthly subscription price is ridiculously high. Disappointing. I'm gonna switch to Google keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a paid member since 2006, it was a good app but becoming worse and worse, not syncing, app froze, now I cannot use it with my Samsung phone .... what make me give up is when I checked the forum for solution I found that the answer are mostly unfriendly to members who raised questions .... (I didn't involve, just read), in other words, they have no intension to improve."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite note app for a very long time, even was a paid member. But their prices had become ridiculously high. And I'm blocked from using it to take notes as a FREE user because I exceeded the notes I can create. So stupid, going to an ultinative and deleting. I don't mind paying for GREAT service. But when you show me you just being greedy, I don't want nothing to do with your services any more. Especially when there are a plenty of GREAT ultinative..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow AF, why bother?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Captures all my notes, including text, audio, video, and links. Easy searching and browser add ons make saving info a breeze."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote suddenly logged me out, and every time I tried to log in, it said there was an error. I uninstalled it to try to get past the glitch, then it wouldn't let me log in because I already had synced the max. number of devices unless I gave them money subscribing or having a ""free trial"" followed by cc charges. Removed both devices currently synced.. Didn't work. Uninstalled and installed again.. Still didn't work. My personal info, journals, etc are being held hostage. Sooooo not cool grrrrr"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has made it impossible to sign in to my account. After inputting my email & password, it asks me to check my email for a verification code, which I do. However, every time I do so, the Evernote sign-in screen completely resets to the initial blank login page and I have to start the process over again, only to have to go through the same verification & Evernote resetting of the login screen in an endless loop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2012 for free with the option to upgrade to a paid plan for extra features. I have thousands of notes. All of a sudden, I open the app to see that with the new update, theres a ""50 note cap for my current plan"". They've now gone from constantly trying to get me to upgrade to trying 2 force me into upgrading into a paid subscription. Evernote, you're not the only note taking app that exists. I've put many onto this app. Unless this changes, you've lost a user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Please stop the constant updates. Once a month would be fine. It's very annoying now. And please get rid of those notifications of these updates. Some people want to just use the thing, not read all your notifications. Making them optional might be a solution, but please get rid of the red number top left on my desktop version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The absolute worst app designed. Adds constant, flips orient, crashes, oh wait more adds. I would rather use Paper. Who's paying for the membership on a Note app???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been using this app for 10 years. At the beginning it was great... Till they started making you pay for absolutely everything. I have more than 1000 notes that I can't access. So I guess I'll save the data and uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They increased the subscription fee by more than double previous rate, and in return the latest version is less user friendly, slow and glitchy. Now it takes several steps to get to my notebooks, when it should be first option. Instead front page is pushing options I don't need and never subscribed for. And it is now slow and unable to load when it was instantaneous before. This combined with same month of applying an unreasonably large price hike on me, is a joke. No respect for customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I would like Evernote to explain to me and the public Evernote Security breach and how I was billed last year 129.99 then $40 and billed twice now this year, My bank statement shows Evernote attempted to withdraw $185.08 and $76.00 in addition to not honoring my 10 redeem points for one month free Evernote. Evernote was supposed to be $ 10.83 a month for personal and $ 14.17 for professional. Evernote continues to overbill and take excessive money in overbilling"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has spoiled itself. Today I found it inaccessible. Some people still keep back up on pen and paper or on other apps. I'm among them but many would stop trusting this app altogether"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. I've been using Evernote for at least 5 years. Lately, the app only asks me to upgrade to premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had and used Evernote for decades. Recently, the app kept crashing and would not let me log in. I finally logged off, uninstalled/reinstalled it today, then had to reset password. Once I logged in, everything was gone, completely wiped clean. I had lots and lots of important information as well as journal entries from years ago. It's all gone. Getting rid of this app and gotta find a more secure one now. So disappointed and frustrated. Also, trying to Close my account, it won't let me. Wow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Booooo! Booooooo! I've lost the majority of the pictures that accompanied the entries! Getting ready to say goodbye to EverNote! In the beginning this was the greatest app EVER but now it's TRASH! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬 I WANT TO GIVE IT A ZERO RATING!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so awesome it hurts. been using for years, and they are one of the few apps that stays up with the times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Somebody should sue you for bait and switch, deleting features I paid you for. Owned by some guy in India"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just like others, new update has ruined this app. 1 Notebook with only 50 notes is practically useless. There is zero chance I will pay $130/yr to take notes. There has to be something in the middle. As it is I'll be in taking my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for a while now. But recently when I try to log in . It doesn't respond? Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"now moved to pay only"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly prompting to subscribe, every time you open the app, with hard to find decline button, some times button is not even there. Recently app started crashing too. Will need to migrate all my notes to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App used to be great. Then it limited the amount of notes i could have and started taking too long to load. Now i can't even log in. Disappointed and will delete if not fixed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app. Can't function without it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lowering my rating. App was allright some time ago, but is becoming less and less user friendly, the useful startup screen is gone in the most recent update, and replaced with a useless welcome screen that doesnt show my widgets anymore. Considering the massive price hike, it's really infuriating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app gets awful! Shame!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"painfully slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app! I'd be lost without it!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Like others, I have been a user for a very long time, and loved the versatility and ease of use, having it both on my computer for journaling and phone for common lists. But I'm extremely disappointed that its now a subscription, and not cheap, which unfortunately cannot fit into my budget. Also, the new interface is meh, and I'm already far beyond the max for free, I cant create new notes. Guess Ill have to save my stuff and find a different app. Thanks Evernote, it was good while it lasted!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Heavy n slow. Since the 10vers evernote become better and better downgrades"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really liked it at first but too many recent changes, all bad. Retroactively changed what free customers can do adding new limits to number of devices etc. Constant ads to get you to upgrade, the reason for the limits. Saved photos corrupted and lost over time apparently due to various ""updates."" Periods of time when I couldn't access my notes at all, credentials had to be reset. It has taken some time to save what was left but will be deleting Evernote as soon as I close this review."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It plays a huge rone in my life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even login in this version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Getting better!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT BOTHER– previously free features have been monetized. Rancid business practices, useless if you don't pay now. Hope your company goes under."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have relied on it for 15 years, but search continues to get slower over time, and I miss having the data locally stored"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Exceptionally Unimpressed. Bait and switch I'm out!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It was good till we were forced to upgrade to a pricey premium package and the entire interface got worse. Switched to other note apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"annoying how it constantly tries to up sell plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for years, now they only allow 10 free notes TOTAL, and that includes the notes you ALREADY have before they hide everything basic behind a paywall. 100% do not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last update interface is awful :( bring us the previous interface where the pinned notes was appears on the Home screen it makes the life easier :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The earlier home screen was better. Good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new layout is awful. Everything used to be so streamlined. All of my recently accessed notes came up first. Now I have to dig for them. The subscription pop ups are annoying. I get at least 3 before I even access one of my notes. $55-125 a year for a subscription. I understand they're a business and need to make money but how bout you lower that to $25 across the board. And roll back the updates! Fix bugs but leave the rest alone. It was working perfectly before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"My notes are no longer on the home page where I liked them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been using this app since 2011 and has been a cornerstone of my organizational world. It struggled mightily through the pandemic, but the functionality, capability and reliability have increased significantly in the past year. Keep up the good work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad each time ask for money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the update, the app crashes as soon as you log in. Now unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Forever with this note... I wish!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"When you exit a note, it goes back to the very top of the notes list. Makes it very difficult to explore your notes and ""flick through them"" in the same way you would a notebook because you're constantly scrolling to find where you left off. Also, has only 50 notes for free, whereas OneNote and other alternatives are unlimited, so I don't see the point of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Destroyed. This app is so bloated with adds and begging to purchase premium I un-installed it. So many pop-ups it became unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had Evernote almost since it's inception. So disappointed at where it's ended up. Not everything has to be a subscription service, I would have gladly given them a one-time lifetime payment but now it's like the last 10 years of my note-taking life are now locked behind a faulty glitchy paywall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Can never go wrong with Evernote"" my first comment in April 2014, 10 years later after several notes, now I'm being charged to add additional notes. That is disappointing, and there's no way to transfer notes to another application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app & have used it for years! Easy to use and always handy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to even create account. Says my pw expired but I have never even created an account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wish I could give less than 1 star. Try Upnote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst note taking app i have used. I cant log in anymore for who knows why. I used to be able to use it without a sign in.... It constantly will mot let me make a new note because it says i have hit my limit of 50.. i just counted and have 29...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Really like the new mobile update (May 2024) but the cost is too much. That's sad because this has been my go to note app since 2009."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The new update for android mobile app is not user friendly. I need to put information in 'on the fly'. I have been putting info in anywhere then later figuring out how to move to a certain notebook. Double the effort."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lame, I have a lot of notebooks and notes on here and just found out they have limited it unless you pay a yearly subscription, this sucks, I mean yeah charge for other stuff but limiting amount of notes? Wow not like it actually costs to make notes, I'd get it if it was for more fonts etc, but this was a feature that is basic, just gonna stick to notion from now on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"something happened and I think I've lost all of my saved data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Slow at syncing. You need to wait for a while for the Evernote to sync on different devices after opening it up. Otherwise good note taking tool for multiple devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update is completely broken on Pixel 8 Pro. Screen doesn't respond to any input."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"updates inconsiderate of user workflow. I've used Evernote for over a decade and luckily found a replacement app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely annoying app on Android. almost worthless. Evernote developers are morons. Several updates and still a disfunctioning app. I guarantee you that the developers are not using this app themselves."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many pop ups for subscription we don't want. Give us a one time payment option, allow us to download notes or leave us in peace with free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Now unusable due to the amount of ads & messages."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have my whole brain on Evernote and would be lost without it. Please make the widgets page the default home page again or better yet, let me choose a default page, so I can always open to my list of notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used loads of apps before to keep my notes, but now I don't have to anymore, since Evernote does more or less everything I need. Updated 2024.03: since it has pushed to have a homescreen, and especially put up an absurd paywall for quite basic or redundant functions, it's no longer preferred app. Update 2024.05 further bugs, I can't even use my notes now via mobile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go to app for note making, but ever since they made it premium, using it has been a hassle instead of a time saver. They are charging 519 from students for note making?! I'd rather use word or another software instead of paying a high amount for notes that don't load in time. It also has back-up issues, at times it does not save my notes and I lost all my data. The app has gotten so slow, it's difficult to search. Overall, extremely disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I agree that the new interface is terrible. The previous version was intuitive but now I spend far too much time just searching for a notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i like it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Originally offered free with unlimited notes then changed to a limit of 50 notes. Constantly pressuring you to purchase unlimited package for $150 per year. Shame on them!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really naggy unless you're paying a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app doesn't work correctly. Pop-up reminders don't work!!!!! I paid for a year and lost my money!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate what this app has become. Bloated, slow, limited usability and constant popups. It's a shadow of what it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New UI is unusable and antiquated. The whole look and feel is boring."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote keeps secret Secret and an easier reference"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid piece of legacy. Nothing works good Not body will support you I'm here over 10 years. No chance to migrate from this trap. Keep away"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to login... I was signing in with Google account but now whenever I try to do so... It takes me to browser rather than signing in and when I give permission it takes to login page again and again .. before this update it was working great.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Longtime user. The constant multiple nags to pay overpriced amount for premium are getting out of hand. Every single time you open it and often multiples. Forcing me to seek an alternative. The price is too high. I'd pay a reasonable amount just to kill the nags. The nag approach is some of the worst. This is backfiring on you guys. Causing a mass exodus."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App was once good but now it's horrible. Constant popups and it lies about what you can do. It says I can use 1 notebook and 50 notes but paywalls me at 24 notes. Please don't waste your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app...I've been using it for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very Functional, Very Dependable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"doesn't see any significant improvement for years. Such a lazy company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'd like to thank corporate greed for this rating, I have used this app for about 5 years and the one time I sign in on another device it screws me out of my notes until I Fork over $15 a month. An outrageous price that this service neither needs nor deserves, take your fancy 'upgrades' and $15 and shove it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years. It was not great a few last years, but still it was useable. But after Bending Spoons buy Evernote, it is awful limitation for free users, it doesn't allow u to work before you close ""Buy premium"" poo up. I have thousands bugs. There a lot of good alternative. Not recommended."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What untested releases. I cant do anything once any popup comes in the App. It simply freezes. I am not able to see any notes I have taken because every time I open the app, one or other popup comes up and thats it for the app. How do I extract the notes I had added??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The pay wall nurfed this app completely..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I ❤️ Evernote. I have been using it for years and it comes with me through different jobs, and I use it when I am researching purchases and, yes, recipes. I will pay for it from social security funds. I love it. It's integral to my life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Latest update and now I can't click on anything and can't access my pivotal notes. It feels like each update gets worse than the last."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was good for years, but can't use it anymore as now it is just a advertisemachine for very(!) hefty prized app. It is very hard to use it anymore. I so byebye after 12 years of active use.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New interface is terrible! Down from 5 stars. Interestingly, they disabled comments for video that describes their new interface, I can't help thinking it's because of the barrage of negative comments. The old interface instantly showed 10 most recently accessed notes that. Now I it take multiple taps to see only the 3 most recent. The only way to find anything else is to search! There video claims most user only want to capture notes. Ridiculous! We use it as much or more to access notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to really enjoy this app. But it seems they care more about their finances. They now restrict you to only 14 notes and constantly bombard you with upgrade notices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be pretty good. Sketch not working. Kinda worked but not since last update. Not worth yearly cost. 5/05/2024 - sketch still worthless on Z Fold 3. Really disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Hi, I would like to know how to delete Evernote app on my other 2 devices which I can't access anymore because both die suddenly many years ago. Is there any other way to delete it so that I can download the app to my new device without getting the: ""you have exceeded the free download messages."" Thank you very much, I appreciate your help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Often crashes when trying to open a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It is better to put recent notes on top for easy access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Replacing my 5* review from 2011 - what have you done?! New company owners are doing nothing to the premium services to justify the exorbitant subscription fee- just ensuring the free tier is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I want to cancel my 7 day free trial. How do we do it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App stopped working on my phone last year and nothing I did fixed it. Now the want people to pay to have more than 50 notes and 1 book."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not intuitive. Pressing and holding a note or notebook does not activate a menu. Notes and pages often fail to load. Massive reduction on what you can do with the free version with a limit of one notebook, 50 notes, and 60 mb limit per month, one device to sync."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most capitalist note app ever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Massive improvement with the new version! I have been using Evernote for years but I have been having problems with the Android app crashing 50% of the time when I would click on a note. This has been going on for over a year. The new update in May 2024 fixed all of this. I have no more crashing and the app appears to be three times faster. Kudos to the Evernote team because I was considering changing note-taking apps. The new interface design is also much better. Well done EN team!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"March 26,2024 update now we CAN'T even make a new note without subscription.. That's the end then. I'm moving out. Google Keep still free. Bye After update.. Boom.. White screen. Frozen like hell. Lol Hai developers have you ever heard wise man said ""do not fix something that isn't broken"" Go to your corner bring those cone of shame.. 🤣"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love, love, love!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become a very disappointing app, taking away basic user privileges unless you upgrade, not even letting you open the app unless you update it. Unwelcoming culture. I'm no longer willing to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They let me down. Used this app right religiously, then they told me I can't even use it anymore unless I pay $130 a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've lost all my notes. The app is now full of ads. I cannot login on the website."

Evernote does NOT have a 1800 number to talk to someone about how to fix. can someone help me fix this problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this app for my lyrics in my band. You guys can't seem to stop updating and ruining everything because I don't always have internet and I paid for premium so that I could download the the note to my tablet and not the affected by not having Internet. Get you seem to update every single day and cause me problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new UI looks trash and downgraded. Also feels like I need more steps now to reach some notes. I'm not returning to this app after my subscription ends."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been in it too long too escape and no way to port notes out, but it's always bugging"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So irritating how many times it prompts you to start paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very nice app ideal for all kinds of writing and note taking.... One feature that the publishers need to pay attention to is ""Untitled Attachment"" notice in place of the actual image..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"smooth responsive notetaking app which works well across oS and devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"PLEASE give us Android users an option to go straight to saved notes when opening the app. The new home screen's great for new users & iOS users, & they're your top priority, I get it. But as a paying power user for 10+ years, I REALLY don't need to be greeted with a setup that's just a copy of my Android Evernote widget every time—on top of 10+ seconds of waiting. It also was possible to force dark theme on Evernote widgets regardless of the overall system light/dark setting, please bring back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want to upgrade and not using app for money as well but every time notification open for upgradation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app will serve you three ads urging you to pay for the premium edition just to view a single note. Used to be great, now it is irritating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother. You can't create notes for free and the pricing model is absolutely absurd."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My own personal information gathering and sorting tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Less popups would be nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible technical support. Completely unhelpful to the point where I just gave up after several email exchanges. Also constantly pestering to pay for subscription service every time I use the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was using this application on occasion since 2012. Today I needed to check a password. When I opened the app. All my notices was gone? Then it asked me to buy a subscription to use the application? Been using it for free all this time. Why would I now buy a subscription? When there are better note taking apps available? Was able to find my old note I needed. I just copied and pasted the note another note taking application. Will delete this application from my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was fabulous and working great. A few months ago, every time I opened the app I had to click out of many screens asking me to upgrade to the paid app to be able to make multiple notebooks. It was incredibly annoying. I don't need multiple notebooks, just access and use of the notes I've had for almost 10 years since 2015. Now I've opened the app and it's frozen, no matter how many times I turn off and on my phone, close and reopen the app. You've lost a long term user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like it ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be good but is now useless trash. If you want to view a note, you have to first click through pop-ops offering you the premium version for $130/yr, and then having to confirm that you're sure you don't want that even though you may never get the chance to get that special offer again. (You will. Every. Single. Time.) Not only that but it froze me from creating new notes, saying the limit is 50 with the free plan. I deleted down to 24, but it still won't let me create new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so useful ln many ways"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a mess! It cannot be considered as a serious business tool anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All my entries have been deleted after years of use (without a warning) because they all of a sudden require you to pay for the app to use it. Extremely disrespectful. I uninstalled the app and will never ever use it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing, now asking me to sign in and isn't recognising my log in details. Was a brilliant app and now it's just not as good. I'm a premium user but probably not for much longer. Stop messing with it!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lot of push and pop ups and hoops to jump to upgrade..but I won't since many of the attachments I saved are unusable or destroyed. Bye Evernote for OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once a great app, now just something that constantly and repeatedly asks you for money. NO I DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR THE FULL FEATURES, THE BASICS ARE GOOD ENOUGH, STOP MAKING ME HAVE TO ANSWER THE SAME QUESTIONS THREE TIMES EVERY TIME I USE THE APP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it stopped working at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"don't bother"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since the improvements, the app opens slowly, and notes can't be updated. Quite frustrating as I use Evernote extensively."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sick of automatic change password prompts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE. I'm not kidding when I say this is the absolute worst note app on the app store. I'd rather use literally anything else. The amount of pop ups you get when you open the app to try and get to your notes is insane unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money for a subscription... To take notes... There's so many free note apps out there that are so much better than Evernote. Evernote didn't use to be this bad but ever since they started pushing subscriptions, it's become unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Looked much better before and was easier to use. This is a cheaper copy of Evernote mobile. Great job by ruining it for mobile devices!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The UX update has absolutely broken the app. Impossible to search (results just don't load). Hard to enter a note -- the UI is quite jarring and it's very easy to select the title field for the main text or the other way round. I'm glad I don't pay for this product, and in fact this UX update is a great reminder to not easily end up paying for *any* subscription product out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Don't get Evernote if you are looking for a simple note pad app. I tried using the free version but no matter how many times I said I wasn't interested it asked me to upgrade to the $200 dollar premium package EVERY SINGLE TIME I'd open the app. Sorry Evernote, but I'm not spending two hundred bucks to keep a grocery list. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it's bad, sales ads everytime you open the app. And now after some updates, the app doesn't even allow me to navigate after opening. I'd have changed note app long ago if not because I've been using it for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"real disaster"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible now. It was my go-to for note taking. Now it forces you to pay a premium. Sod that. Not only that but it says it will allow you 1 notebook and 50 notes. Yet I've got 42 notes and it still says I need to upgrade if I want to make anymore....rendering the thing pointless. I keep it installed in case they revert back to how it was....but I won't hold my breath."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a dead app for over 24 hours now, and support is impossible to get ahold of. I think it's time to try a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Many people have been using this app for over 10 years to store important notes. All of a sudden they changed everything and now you can only create 50 notes unless you pay for a subscription. After 10+ years I have over 200 notes and I suddenly can't create any more for free. There should be a better transition other than cutting everyone off cold turkey. And there are several pop up messages trying to get you to pay. I can't access my notes on this app without clicking through several pop ups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app bombards me with so many ads, I'm going to transfer my notes and ditch it very soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"300 num bloco de notas??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Simply the best! However, I'd love if it's possible to created a nested-notebook. There are times I wish I could arrange some notebooks of similar category as subsets one main notebook. Please!!! Try to add this functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be so good. Now every time I use it I'm hassled with multiple attempts to get me to pay for services before I can access my notes. Then met with the ""are you sure?"" Prompt to make the process even more obtrusive and annoying. I'm uninstalling and looking for a better alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant prompt to upgrade to premium renders it unusable. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With each update it beacomes worse and worse. The latest update resulted in a snail like performance. Evrything is so slooooow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to see image added to my notes in landscape. I don't want to enable orientation in my device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new interface introduced April '24 is awful. I used to be able to search other notes when in a related note. Now I have to click all the way back to the home page (there's no single click to get there), losing my current note to find another. To make things worse, they took away the recently edited notes as well. It's impossible to work with two notes anymore. Add to this that recently when opening a note, it sometimes spins and spins. Evernote, once a great app, has lost its way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I began using Evernote in 2015, it was an excellent note-taking app. It was quick, reliable, and easy to use. Files were kept locally so an internet connection was only needed when syncing. The later ""cloud-based"" versions have become bloated, buggy, and slow. Making things worse, in 2023 the price for the personal version increased 43% and now in 2024 they have more than doubled that! At twice the annual price of Microsoft's full software suite, it's not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever! They will harass you every time you open the app to use it, to get you to subscribe. Once you've actually made an investment to write down all your notes, they will tell you that you can't add anymore until you subscribe. Extortion! Never again!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm not at all happy with the latest update in this apps format. It isn't nearly as intuitive as the last."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"if you're a fan of taking notes, this is for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they charged me off of an accident and won't refund even though I contacted within 3 minutes of incident. so yeah it SUCKS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update April 2024: Ridiculous, they just locked everything behind a paywall, after using the free version for years, now suddenly it's an expensive yearly subscription or it's bricked at one notebook and 150 notes. Way to piss in the faces of long time users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I really like Evernote cuz I can put any type of file in it that I want and it's there The only problem I have is that sometimes they're not easy to locate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was the 1st update that I hated and regret allowing. The widget list moved to the top from the rearactable slider - waste of space. Where is the checkbox widget? How can I revert to previous? 2024apr27 UPDATE 1) Move all that business junk to the more expensive subscription and lower the rediculous price for normal people. 2) How do I make ""myWidgets"" my default instead of that new & useless home screen? I don't have time for that trash. 3) Does Evernote hate their subscribers?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow Software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of use, the App is now a diaster. Unless you pay, you will be bombarded with offers to purchase every time you click on something. The time has come to uninstall as there are much better apps to consider"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I DONT want the premium version! It is so annoying asking all the time. I am trying other apps to move my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super useful app to boost your productivity and organize your thoughts!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Need a mind map function, and also ability to quickly access our own created templates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is ridiculously pricey, and the web version stopped working without warning. The desktop version is slow as hell, constantly crashing, and the option of exporting notes to PDF actually doesn't work. It is the most non-user-friendly app I have ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After update it takes too much time to open the homepage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most recent update has rendered the app unusable, at least on my android phone... All touch functionality is broken"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A great writing resource for all notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Subscription policy needs significant improvement ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No RTL support, missing basic editing tools...instead of useless AI, why don't you start with the Basic!!!! fix your editor......"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"support is awful lots if bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was the best note taking App ever, I didn't even mind paying for it until I couldn't access it anymore on my phone or my computer. Now I can't access all of my songs, the books I was writing and I am out what I paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app. I use it constantly. So great if you travel and don't want to lug all your notes with you. it's all right here at the tap of your fingers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Useful and practical note taking, with access on Chromebook or via a web browser"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NOT FREE ANYMORE! Used to be an amazing app, now I'm forced to pay for a membership before I can add a note due to them changing how many you can have for free. I'm so disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app but since they raised their prices in 2023 (and in previous years as well), and since there are more apps available for lower price point that do similar things, Evernote is no longer the same great app choice as it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for to-do lists and journals"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love the more intuitive approach"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been an under utilized gem of an organizational tool. It has been my repository for ideas and documents of value since its inception."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good Application for creating notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"all good except web clips sometimes doesn't work on Android"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years. It was my go to for all kinds of notes. But recently the ads have become unbearable, I just need a reliable notes app. The last straw was how now it crashes upon startup. So that's it, I'm going back to Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Too many updates are a good thing but also a bad thing. Stop changing and let me learn how to use the new modifications."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update disasaster ,on Android have to make 5 clicks every time to open default Directory.Answer stupid questions and directed to unwanted tasks. What an intrusion on the few hours we have to spend on this earth."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ud 8th pake ini dan tiba2 di update lalu berbayar. Smua foto2 pntg ilang ga bs di donlot! Bye. Ga mau pake lg!! Kecewa"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years, now they paywalled it. Disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is garbage now. I'm just adding my one star to a huge list unhappy people that this company does not care about. Had an account for 12 years and in the last 3 it's slowly turned into junk I can no longer use. No way I would pay these prices when all of these options used to be free, I've had an account long enough to remember and there are better options now that won't hold my data hostage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using Evernote since 2008 and it used to be great, but lately has become worse since the company was bought out. The phone app is horrendous...they keep trying to ""fix"" something that isn't broken. I'd like to be able to go to Folders without having to search for them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The application is not working as it keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My FAVORITE app!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I would donate to this app but don't want to spend $15 a month for features I don't need"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The pop-up ads for upgrade are JOKES atp. They went so nuts with the ads that they're on ""hot singles in your area that want to meet you"" level. X out the first ad and think you can start your note? NOPE, here's another pop-up. Each pop-up says it's the LAST TIME I can get this deal...it's been the LAST TIME every day, multiple times per day, for months now. Evernote is acting like a spiraling, desperate friend. Like...are you okay, buddy? What's going on at home?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The note taking is good, the app is simple and intuitive to use. The only problem is that it doesn't sync unless you're using the app, so every time I open it to take a quick note about something I need to wait until it opens and sync my notes. Otherwise I've experience a glitchy interface and the app deleting what I just wrote. Also in the desktop version there's a slow update almost every day and every time it shows a annoying pop up with what's new. Definitely canceling my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Had to change my review to reflect the persistent pop up ads asking if I want to buy a subscription. Plus the app now limits how many notes you can make unless you PAY. Would pay for a license if it was a one time payment, but I won't pay for a subscription. I have since moved all my notes to email and deleted the app after using it for years. I want to support any dev that makes something I use, but I HATE subscriptions. Goodbye, old friend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm giving 2 stars instead of 5 now, because after the last update, Evernote is super glitchy, and the latest design changes feel clunky and unfamiliar. Edit* I've been with this app for years and years. While I love this app, there has never been a more impersonal app. They keep revamping the app so every few months you have no idea where things are, and just when you feel like you're used to where things are, they change it. I've reached out to them several times and never heard back once."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"sooooo slow its almost unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous! The price is absurd! It seems to get more and more expensive. No longer happy with this app anymore. I will be definitely be switching over to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Support, how do I uninstall the new mobile update? I want my home page back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Meets all my needs so far."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"takes forever to load. you often have to open and clise ut and then reopen. you cannot copy and paste outside of Evernote without some weird issues showing up or formatting problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If wil exist put 10 minus down for review I do it. After 14 years what was Evernote my book, my part life and my notes for great idea it is over, over freedom, which you not have free on the apps anymore. The apps crew which make the reason want make more money on this and is hungry for the money, of course who not be in this time, but for Evernote it will big tax, which will pay later or maybe pay now. Many people leave in better apps, but after many years it is really not be nice and easy...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the insane price increase, I've exported all my notes to Joplin. Such a stark jump in pricing is in my mind not justifiable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used this for years and can't imagine my life without it! It holds all my notes for screenplays, it holds information that I need now and later and it is indispensable to me. The fact that I can access my information from my phone as well as my laptop is so helpful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great product. Been using for years. Very disappointed in most recent doubling of price. 🤔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be like an extention of me, Evernote is on every device I own. However, with the recent INSANE price increase, and the consistent (yet undesired and not needed at all) changes to the interface, what was once a familiar part of my every day life, gets increasingly annoying, expensive, and foreign. I get it, you want to change with the times, but at least give an obvious path to an old familiar interface, and don't have some ridiculous price increase for the exact same service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled You need to fix pass code lock. I installed it three times already, or is it not intended to be used on all of the devices? Seems legit to have additional password that has to be entered if account in signed in state"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. However, now I'd rather just use plan old notes that comes with the phone. stop blasting users with membership ads and pop-ups every time you open the app. Also, no one is going to pay the same price, if not more, of a Netflix membership for some note app. you're absolutely crazy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another stupid update.. just as I learn where everything is from the last update we have another update changes everything. Now I have to try and read words that are almost impossible to see because of the stupid colours that are used. I want to create a note in a particular notebook but can't because it always goes to the default notebook. Evernote was used for 5 years ago now it's just a toy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App utile ma troppo pesante e macchinosa. L'accesso è un problema perché devi loggartti ad ogni accesso ed il processo è molto molto lento. L'autenticazione da google spesso da errore Peccato"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How this offers anything besides brazen extortion of your existing notes is beyond me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evrytime i open this app i have to navigate at least 2 ads with no clear close link to get to my notes. I used to use this for store lists and other ideas i wanted to keep track of but this is beyond unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hate the new layout. Previous everything was accessible from the first page, but now you've got to hit different icons to find things. Nowhere near as user friendly as it was. I pay for it as I used to love it, but I'm looking for a replacement as I hate the new layout so much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love having everything I need to do, or want to do in one place -"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely not happy, I only had one day and it updated over night to what it thorght I wanted new and improved but really what it did was delegate everything I had done in it the day before, not happy at all 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please, improve the performance of the app. After the UI update, it's kindy laggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Honestly I far prefer Evernote to OneNote any day of the week. The code block formatting in Evernote is such a nice feature. Great app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new home page is really awful. No way to customize it like before and just another poor design decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"slow, lots of clutter useless add ons"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really like using this app the only thing that is troublesome is converting it to a word or a PDF it takes a lot of steps to do that. the once it's done it works out. it would be nice to see a conversion link inside the app. that is a suggestion for the developers make it easier for us users to share our work. if it wasn't for that I would have waited in five stars having to convert it is time consuming an unproductive at times. however it is a great app to organize your work and thoughts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I enjoy how it's going, the UI and everything. Kudos."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"overpriced. lacks many abilities. certainly not the best option. just basic storage. no printing or anything else. they lost me when they doubled price and offered nothing, I was a good customer for YEARS!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"HIGHLY useful and convenient. Good format."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great app, use it all the time. love it's note organization features like tags, and note search, notebooks. just wish I could set and change the pic thumbnails assigned to notes. please please, that's all I ask for and it's need a suggestion on the forums I think since 2015 if not longer. Seems a simple thing to implement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the developers keep making basic free features into paid, the experience is just getting worse everytime."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'll join the Chorus saying this app used to be great, but now is nearly unusable. Pity"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I spent a lot of time designing a home page that worked for me and you took it away. Guess it's back to Notion"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 10.86: my PDF attachemets opens ONLY in the native internal reader ( wich is usless for 200 pages), without the possibility to choose my phone apps!!! This are exactly the same problems that I had reviewed for the beta app August 2020. 4 years, no improve!!!!! 1 star, hope for better ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The boot time into this app now is just rediculus."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it lags to much to be a quick note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I really like this app but I would like to see some more features (locking note, sub-tasks or tasks in multiple levels). The app could also benefit from performance modification (snaps inserted into notes are not always visible)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"10 years later and still the best note app out there!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get you hooked in, remove the ability to export all notes so it's more difficult to escape and then ramp up price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Only valid for one device in free version. Have to pay if want to use in two or more devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024 update. It's tragic how badly the money-grab from this company has tanked the app. It's literally one of the best-to-worst app experiences I've ever seen. If someone from Evernote actually reads this: fire your entire PLG team and start over. Unless you don't care that you're pissing off your paying customers who won't give you double the money per year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous! For monthly subscription the amout is ridiculous! Even makes me confused is it even a simple note taking app or not!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"perfect"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this more than 10 years. My first note in 2014 or earlier. But now you are asking money to add a simple note even I'm using this on one single device. So bye, I'm shifting to google docs. Used to be a great app. But now greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but now there's such a paywall that it's nearly unusable for free. I'm deleting this and getting something simpler. I literally just need a notepad on my phone but instead it keeps advertising other unnecessary services."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No I don't want to upgrade to Premium. Your user experience is getting worse. Why can't I see my recent notes on the landing screen?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps getting worse 😞 I've used this all for over a decade! ALL of my notes will be transferred and this app will be DELETED!! Idk what happened to the administration with this app. I'm OVER getting spammed 6 times a day about upgrading. 😡 This has turned into the WORST note app! Notion or OneNote... Here I come! So long Evernote 👋🏻✌🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I just opened Evernote and had 3 subscription pop-ups (dialogs and bottomsheet) on top of each other. By any standard this is excessive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I was using Evernote for almost a decade. But now with their 50 Notes And 1 Notebook Limit I am looking and open for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My number 1 productivity App. I would still like Bending Spoons to continue their updates to include Contact management tools, but meanwhile is used daily and would highly recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has ONE purpose: to take and save notes. I'd like to know what the purpose of this app is if I can't do either because it won't load anything AT ALL?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"C'était une super appli il y a encore quelques semaines, maintenant si tu veux plus de 20 notes je crois, tu dois payer 100€ par ans pour, il faut le rappeler, faire le taff d'un papier et d'un stylo... En plus l'appli bug et met du temps à charger, des fois elle plante et se relance en plein écriture pour aucune raison, enfin bref c'était une super appli, je passe à une autre."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote for almost a decade. It had been a great app for note keeping, simple and secure. But it's now a garbage, shows too many ads on free version. Note taking has become a daunting task, it shows pop ups ads, paid version ads and lot more. The worst case is you can't create new notes inspite of having lot of storage space available from 60 MBs quota. Have found a better alternative in the form of NoteBook from Zoho Communication. Bye bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Some people who are using the app for more than 10+ yrs. report 1*. But it deserves 6* for making an iconic app, and I add 1* because they took a risk to make the best app look modern (v10), revoke the * for usability issues, add * for making me pay once, revoke the * for wanting more and more money. Finally, I revoke 3* for ruining efforts of every own developer by making the best legacy notes app useless, revoke 1* for manipulative tactics, and add 1* (as a hope they will get better). 3 of 6*"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has the potential to be good, but SO intrusive and severely limits the number of notes you can have without paying (like 5). Maybe it's fine if you pay for premium, but I can't even read one of my notes without clicking through 3+ ads asking me to go premium and with hard-to-find buttons to close the ad. I just want to access my grocery list without clicking 10+ times.... Copy/pasting my notes into a new note-taking app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version and limitation of this app now is worst and is making me migrate to onenote and other free editions. They hav become more greedy and money minded ppl with lot of ads and just 50 notes in free edition."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for more than 5 years. I have 300 notes, and now I can't add new notes because they put a 50 notes limit unless you pay a subscription, but I'm not paying a subscription to regain something I already had for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was the best notes app out there, until the owners became too greedy. You can't even open the App nowadays before you're being greeted with multiple popups asking you to subscribe. And now they even removed the option to create notes if you're not subscribed. Copying all my notes to OneNote and deleting this app from my phones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"perfectly mediocre note taking app. nothing to offend. nothing to delight."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Be careful entrusting your precious notes and sensitive information here. Because if when their service and app become ugly for you, it will be hard to migrate out your precious data. They become like a ransomware that you still have to continue paying to be able to migrate-out your data. Its better to use Microsoft OneNote, you can use the app without limit but you just need to subscribe to OneDrive storage if 5GB is not enough. I paid a month of evernote just to download my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now asking for subscription ever time you open the note, can't create new note without subscribing. Extremely annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constantly changing makes it difficult to use, to do the simple things you could when Evernote started. And guess what? Annual fees are through the roof. For What? Additional enhancements I will NEVER use. I feel stuck with Evernote. .g"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years for taking notes. I was okay with an ad every now and then. Every time I open the app it's an advertisement for paying for something. Used to. I could hit an x and it would go away. Now you added a second pop-up asking if I'm sure. I know I'm sure going to backup all of my notes to a different app now and cease using Evernote on every device I own. And actively tell people to not use Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The ""continue"" button to sign in (rather than use Apple or Google) does not do anything, so I can't use my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely greedy app ever since they were bought out. 1 notebook and 50 notes is abysmal. U paywall the reason people used to come to this app for. The rate to which you use FOMO is disgusting. How many times will i be told it's the last time I see an offer, only to see it again next login? Why'd Bending Spoons acquire this app just to ignore feedback and kill the platform? I've since moved to Paper, and I'd suggest all find a new fav as well. This apps incentive is now naught. They ruined it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2015. And to put it simply, they are now on a very greedy road. Seriously? In order to take notes using the (FREE PLAN) I'm limited into taking only 50 notes and creating only 1 notebook and that's it? Unless If I have to pay for their monthly plan? Yeah, go f yourself. Evernote. This deserves zero stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the applecation keep crashing im not able to access my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is very bad. it's always Laggy and full of bugs. And guess what ? You guys trashed the free plan. Now it's useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"more common sense than one note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst APP EVER!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an Evernote user since day one - have loved the functionality despite constantly being asked to upgrade from the free, basic plan. Over the years they've stripped away functions and now I'm not even able to create new notes as I've been capped at 50 notes (which I have many more than currently so at least I haven't lost any data). Goodbye Evernote, hello MS OneNote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I still have every meeting note since Evernote started. Brilliant simple solution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Couldn't live without it daily."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a longtime user of Evernote's free version, I recently made the switch to different better app, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my decision. Having relied on Evernote for approximately a decade, it was disheartening to see the continuous pop-ups urging an upgrade to their premium membership, which came with a hefty price tag. This constant intrusion led me to part ways with the app, hopeful that the company will prioritize user demand and experience in the future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote incessantly pesters users to subscribe, disrupting the workflow and causing significant annoyance. This intrusive behavior is incredibly frustrating and severely hampers the user experience. Dear app developers, please address this immediately if you care about your users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Somebody please buy Evernote and make it a decent note taking app again! It's just awful and you're charging a ridiculous premium for it. There are some amazing apps for free or under $10 and you want$42-$70 every year! Unless you sell out now, I don't see Evernote making it til the end of the year! Just do the right thing! For the rest of us, get Joplin Notes. Better in many ways and totally free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EVERNOTE compells user upgrade upon every login. service auto reply. problems never fixed. game of chance over + out. notepad empty. evernote propaganda state limit reached? two device user (mistake to add device) stay lite user. infrequent user. force data sync. no opt-out option. Basic free is fake. Ads deny access to settings. Either upgrade or uproot. never again! 2013 - 2024 user. i am travelling to 305 Walnut St, Redwood City, CA 94063, USA AU to verify place of practice is real!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they ruined a perfectly good app. ui is cluttered, unnecessary new features, slower load times since updating the web app interface. it's basically a microsoft office type planner/scheduler now? I'm actively looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How horrible of an app you now are. Since I had an issue with my phone, I had to uninstall Evernote. Upon reinstalling it, there was no way to obtain the ""free"" app without trying the paid app for seven days. What a trap. I guess this is the only way they are making money. Too bad. I used to like them. Not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is pulling a fast one on me. I've used this company for 15 years, and just found out they are more than doubling my yearly fee. going to have to find an alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New owners have killed this product. Have been a loyal fan of Evernote for over 10 years. Have put up with app becoming more and more unusable due to pop ups, but I stuck with it. But now I find I can't add any more notes at all without paying for premium, which is extortionately priced. Disappointed, but c'est la vie, I'll find a new notes app and move everything there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't believe that I am switching from my favorite app but after recent changes, it shows so many annoying pop ups and forces me to pay a lot of money. So today I am saying goodbye after more than a decade.👋😔 I am switching to Microsoft One Note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be my go to for notes but as of late the push towards subscriptions and restrictions on the free model are so obtrusive that it's made me not use the app anymore. Would not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The current versions of Evernote do not function on my 2022 Moto G phone. I can search for notes, but get a black screen when trying to create a note. Being used to relying on workarounds for basic Evernote function, creating a note from Widget does not get around this. Creating a task doesn't either. I can read old notes, and edit them but I cannot tag them. None of this comes as a surprise, I avoided v10+ as long as I could out of intuition. This affects other moto users too. Paid user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app! being able to use cross platform and use for multiple purposes has made this a go to tool for me. keep innovating Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great improvements. Used to use EN but left under old ownership but I'm coming back with all the updates. This is still one of the most superior note taking apps. People complaining about the price haven't looked around, apparently..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Payment approvals aren't satisfactory. delayed response from the support team. Not having a comprehensive grievance meachanism."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fix your highlight function or i will uninstall it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app--love it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years and now they will no longer allow me to create new notes. This is mildly annoying what is making me switch is the 3-4 pop ups they have EACH time you open the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I literally don't have 50 notes and every time I try to make a new one the app keeps forcing me to try and subscribe, this is nonsense. I left this exact review almost a year ago and the problem persists."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went from 5 stars to 1, If I could would be zero. New owners crazy thinking I will pay for making notes. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free limits are a joke. Now, we're limited to a single notebook and I can't even add a note to any notebooks because I had this app when it was still quite good and made beyond the new assinine limit. Subs this high for a text editor are insane. I would pay once for this app and call it a day, but as it is, I'll seek a new way to note ideas and reminders."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep forcing forcing people into paid subscription by blocking more and more features. I'm decided to quit. The only problem is that there's no export option, so I'll have to copy and paste each note separately. I'm not willing to pay for an app which doesn't even work properlu. The writing experience is terrible, it takes too long to open a note or create a new one... I just don't understand why this app can't do even these simple things properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had Evernote since 2013. Before all the whistles, bells, and new features I never use. Sad to say I'll be transferring my data out and starting over with a simpler note app, that doesn't lock basic features behind a paywall. I don't see a reason to pay FOURTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH for features I DONT NEED."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using since 2009, not my top note app anymore, due to ads keep popping up and the limitation of creating new notes. Don't need those features and amount in any upgraded plan. Just time to say goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The most obtrusive ads I've ever seen. If I could give 0 stars, I would. $129 per year? Lol! uninstalling and never looking back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The owners killed this app with note limitations. I recommend any alternative. My go to has been Zoho Notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User for over 6 years. The last few years it has been going downhill. This year full subscription price significantly increased yet the reliability has significantly decreased. Will not be renewing full subscription next year. Android widget has become unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Weast after saving image it does not appear after the opening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"app is crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Prime example of the enshitification of SaaS products these days. I've been a paying user for years. But they've stopped focusing on customer experience and instead are trying to grow revenue via feature creep and using customer data to grow AI models. Worse of all, they force users to update or the app stops working. I'm done with this thing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Created a limit on free accounts so I can't make any more notes on it. Every time I try to access my old notes it makes me click through a ton of pop-ups about their subscription options. Absolutely useless now, and am migrating off this app for something better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It works. I like the SEARCH tool. It's great for sharing. Lots of ways to organize and categorize. Not at all like OneNote. More intuitive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app. An essential part of my ongoing, successful workflow. Ignore the naysayers -- evernote has progressed, and many would want no changes or improvements ever. I use daily (all day) on Windows and with two android devices (phone and tablet)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is the next thing you are going to limit? Number of characters per note? Number of note edits per day? It's time to find an alternative to this app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent, Windows app still is very good but the new startup screen on Android makes it very difficult to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Te obliga cada vez más a que si o si lo tengas de paga, primero eliminan cantidad de dispositivos, como eso no fue suficiente ahora no puedes crear nuevas notas ni carpetas, COERCIÓN NO ES EXPERIENCIA DE USUARIO. Gracias, pero no gracias, adiós Evernote, HOLA NOTION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Idk how you can justify almost doubling your subscription price. Not even trying to be subtle. The app hasn't really changed much over the few years I've used. There are a few UI updates but it felt good as a user cause it was consistent. But with the price change, I'm really doubting if I need this in my life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years. Unfortunately, it keeps on getting worse. Lately, the app keeps on crashing, and I can't view my old notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Can you guys bring back the scratchpad? If you ask me, that is what makes Evernote a true note taking app. The ability to note down something easily and quickly without going through the laborious process of creating and labeling a Note is a Time Saver!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very helpful app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changed my review to one star. Ever note is making it difficult to use and they are asking for ridiculous amount of money to upgrade. This app should be free or a one time purchase. Will be deleting and moving my notes to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"£9 A MONTH for a notepad app, and that's just for the basic package!! The premium version is £18 a month, which is more than I pay for my entire phone contract. Takes forever to open notes even on a modern phone. Have since switched to Google keep which is free and does all I need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally, the only annoyance of this app is it asks me EVERY TIME I open it, if I want to upgrade. If you want to leave an ad at the top then fine, but STOP with the pop ups. Obviously if someone wants more space or full access, they're going to buy the upgrade. I'm just going to transfer all my notes to Google drive instead. 👋👋👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"some of my recordings stop midstream and those portions are thrown away, I do not know where to locate them"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use app just for notes, tons of necessary features, very expensive. I've canceled my annual subscription 2 month before it ends, but the app totally canceled my subscription immediately, until I have at least 2 months to use app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for over 10 years, and I'm switching away. The pricing is INSANE for a subscription, and if you try to use it free, you can barely get to your notes through all the ads begging you to get the subscription. At this point, it's only on my phone because there's no way to download what you have to transfer elsewhere. Avoid, unless a millionaire. There's better free notes apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pictures frim Android gallery can't be inserted. Web clips with pictures or elaborate formatting are just a blue surface. Just rubbish"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now forcing subscription to add more notes. Constant ads asking to subscribe every time I open something. The app is more of an annoyance now than it is a benefit. In a nutshell, they got greedy. It's a notes app..... there are hundreds of them out there, and I'm going to find a better option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to like this app but since a year, they have become too pushy and keep stonewalling you with pop ups that ask you to subscribe or buy something. Sometimes you can't even get rid of the popup as there's no exit button. Also, it doesn't ask me for a password to open it anymore so it's not secure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Yeah, it's my favorite ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling it after using it for 9-10 years. The reason is too many prompts for in-app purchase which are intrusive. Evernote has lost its charm."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. No notifications for reminders. I missed every important reminder that I had set."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I truly love this app, I use it for literally everything. I'll never need a pen and paper again 4-21-24 10 years later and I still use this app daily"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edited my review from 5 stars down to 1. As a former fan, I've experienced Evernote make using this app basically unusable with restricted use, incessant ads and severe lag and performance. Don't get on - the company's philosophy and policy has proven that you'll need to get off one day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Let my notes go!"" –Moses. If you're gonna arbitrarily paywall a ""free"" service already profited off of many times over by selling our most private thoughts to data brokers, at least offer a plan that doesn't retroactively limit quantity of notes to place previously profitable users in an impossible bind as you simultaneously block us from exporting OUR intellectual property; terrorizing us with reckless ""accidental"" data loss. Quit holding my notes hostage to stop my Exodus! EXPORT NOTES NOW!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The forced reinstall did not entail bug fixes, but a forced money grab by the new owners. Either you upgrade or get locked out of you account. Changing the terms of service and then declaring you have exceeded your limit on synced devices is rather sad. * After a reinstall on a new cellphone...sharing news clips or pasting photos to Evernote does not work. Pls advice. Should I update, or is any update still garbage?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing piece of tool I can't live without"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I had to come back and change my review from 5* to 1*. I've used Evernote since 2012. That's 12 years. In the last 2 years , they have ""upgraded"" it to the point that it is completely unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote since it's beginning. It now crashes every time I open a note on my Samsung S9 tablet. It works on all other devices. It must work on the tablet soon or I will have to change apps, which I don't want to. Would be a 5 star if this gets fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit 4/21/24: They have now changed the app so you are only allowed 50 notes for free. Officially done with this app and moving everything to Onenote. What a terrible fall into greedy mediocrity. This is my go to app for notes but as of late there have been a lot of bugs with each line in a list not cutting off the word from the previous line. Please take a look!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: 4/21/24 - it only gets worse. To quote ""Alissa C."" - ""My god, stop spamming me with full page ads to upgrade. Every single time. It's extremely ineffective and I will never do it. Analyze your marketing strategy... if this app gets worse I'll def consider switching."" ____ Bloat, bloat, and I will purposely never pay you since your marketing only serves to turn potential paid users away! Who lied to you about this kind of nuisance being good for business? Fire them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The app just auto-updated, and now there are a lot of issues. The app now ignores my Android regional format settings and forces American formats instead of using British formats with 24-hour clock enabled, just like with the YouTube app. The 'note list' widget is also missing and I'm left with 'Problem loading widget' in Nova Launcher. There should also be better external keyboard support, and some UI space-saving options for smaller displays."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"getting more expensive because of features I don't need. not super secure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote definitely helps keep me and my crew organized and on the same sheet of music. To be able to make changes and instantly everyone receive the update regardless of where they are, if on their Smartphones or computers... WOW!!! 🙋🏾‍♀️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not able to right notes without primium..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"my andoid phone can not send image to evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It seems like it's running a little smoother but still not perfect but they knew UI update is a step in the wrong direction! The new note button is clear on the top right and that whole custom homepage experience is gone! What are they thinking?! In the sketch feature with the Note 8 just stops working at some point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Holding my notes to ransom for a ridiculously high subscription fee? Evernote..., you're fired!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years but it's completely unusable now. An absolute miserable experience. Can't believe they think they can charge $200/year (CAD) just so you can save less than 10mb of text. Don't bother. Use Notes, Keep, or Notion"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app became too pushy and almost completely useless with current limitations. Going to get rid of it when transfer my notes to another app. PS. Now try to manually export notes and face difficulties with transferring images. It seems that Evernote consciously made transition obstacles. Burn in hell!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very happy with this notes app, other than not being able to screenshot. Been using for a decade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use it all the time, even through all the GIVE ME MONEY prompts. Then I received the notification 'you have reached your limit of 50 free notes'. OK, says I and dutifully delete numerous notes that are actually superfluous. Now I can make more, to my limit of 50. No. That won't work. Not only do I not have those notes that I might be able to repurpose. Th app resolutely states I've reached my limit. Fund sometime else. Thus app is dead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So heavy app What will do with this 81 megabytes? Give us a lite version!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will have to move my notes to an alternative app, as 50 note limit does not justify to keep this app installed on my phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"100$ per year if you want to create more than 50 notes? insane.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Experience got gradually worse over the years. The fact that now I have to subscribe in order to create more notes is the last straw. I am transferring to Google notes and deleting Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really really liked this app. It has a great smooth UI , nice touch to it and everything is great. But still i am facing some issues so please fix this issues..... 1. It has limited sorting or rearranging options and one cannot rearrange the notes in a notebook as per their choice. 2. Changing the sorting options led to change the order in all the notebooks - which is really annoying. It's my humble request that please add these features...🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for years, but now evernote is charging for me to add a note. I consolidated my notes down to 30 (under the 50 note limit as the pop up stated) and I still can't create a note. Now I need to move all my notes to another app... I noticed many users in the review section has experienced something similar recently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly changed the rules, so now my past notes are over the limit and I can't make anymore without paying. This is a notes app, what do they need so much money for? Used to love it, now its unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"complete garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome program. Have used it for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Barely anything useable for free now. Boarderline useless, completely degraded itself in 10 years; not worth the money even if I wanted to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"On my tablet, Evernote aborts constantly and is nearly unusable. The program aborts when I attempt to follow an Evernote link."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I love this app but after paying for the ability to work on more than one device, the desktop version only worked for a few weeks, now I'm back to phone only"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been using Evernote for 10 years and I am generally happy. The only complain is the price increase since last year which might make me switch to another option once I have the time to investigate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremly Annoying offers for discount."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I liked original notes system but I can't use it anymore, not happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"File folder is very usefull."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I guess they either sold out to an Indian company, or they just don't care anymore except trying to get money from you. They used to be the best note app. Now, they've sold their soul. Sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Monthly subscription is expensive more than icloud or Google"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Crashes have become routine."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Use it bunches. It is very helpful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2014 Evernote is a 5! 2024 Evernote is a 1! Getting worse with age! The ads for a premium version make it un-useable! Its to the point where i started using Google Calendar and one day I asked myself, why didn't I use Evernote for that? I opened up the app and nothing but ads for the paid version! Realized its been about a year since i used it! I deleted all my notes and uninstalled. I'm not paying the ridiculous amount they want, and a subscription!! Do they think, they're MS365?!?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've removed my 5-star rating and I'm now giving Evernote a 0 star rating. Every year they're trying to get people to spend more and more money and now they've made the app unusable and taken away all of my notebooks access to them until I shell out money. This is illegal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I use Evernote daily. Recently it has constant ""bugs"". I share web pages frequently to Evernote and it often won't work saying it has a ""bug"" and wait for developers to fix it. Great app WHEN IT WORKS. Many things I would change that the developers have changed over the years. Their ""improvements"" are often NOT improvements. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Fee is high"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless customer support"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was working okay for some years and now suddenly needs credit card info to even open it! I've lost my notes and cannot access them to even copy them to another app. Do not use this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"As much as I like using Evernote, this app crashes all the time.....I hope they fix this very soon..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for years, and they just progressively made it worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im mad you gotta pay now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even open my previous notes, it just keeps loading and says try later. Very frustrated and shows how unreliable this app is. Evernote this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using Evernote with a payment subscription for many years and I have always founded a very useful app. But lately it crashes so often in my Android Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+ 5G... That's really annoying! Installing every new update doesn't help: the problem persists or gets even worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for at least 7 years. Recent changes and updates are making me leave. As a free user you are allowed 50 notes on 1 device. I have less than 30 yet I can not create more. This failure coupled with constant and never-ending requests to upgrade to paid version make this app annoying to use. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So annoying. Keeps on having ads to upgrade to the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I haven't ever come across an app which comes up with a once-in-a lifetime offer EVERY single time you log in. There are lots of free or reasonably priced apps which are loads better so I'm finally moving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"used this for more than 7 years. Excellent app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to like using the free version. Now I get asked to sign up for a plan every time I click on something. Sometimes I get two popups in a row. It's at the point where I am currently migrating all my evernotes to my standard notepad and will be deleting. Would not recommend this app unless you are willing to pay for the plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be good, but now laggy and notes glitch on mobile. Will switch to Notion or Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"BEST EVER APP!!! MUCH BETTER THAN KEEP NOTES YOU CAN SEND PASSCODE TO HIDE SENSITIVE INFO . IT'S SO GOOD FOR STUDENTS!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me login or retrieve emails to reset the password"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"somehow they find a way to make this app more and more pathetic with every update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 2024: Awful user experience. App now 100% geared to monetization with constant notifications and mandatory click throughs to confirm that I don't want to pay to keep using it. My notes are effectively locked behind a paywall, and I am unable to create new notes. Evernote pulled a bait and switch locking previously available functionality behind monthly fees. Previous review: New update deleted all my widgets and note shortcuts on my desktop. My personal workflow is broken."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for many years, and now you charge money just to use it at all? Lol seeya 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years. I swear by it. I organize my notes by using the notebooks features. It's super helpful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great apps for many years. Recently, have a lot of bugs. Keep crash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime I wanna quickly take a note on the paid desktop version, I must wait for a damn UPDATE! I will cancel my subscription because of this lag."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've used Evernote for around 10 years now and it's been all I need for handling notes. Only downside is that it has evolved to a point where I need to subscribe to it to get what I need from it. The pricing is still decent for me though, so it continues being my main note application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote is a good platform. It used to be great, but now they try to do everything which makes it slow and no longer easy for note taking. But I prefer Evernote over Microsoft note application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"THEY FORCE YOUR YOU TO PAY!!! AFTER YEARS OF COMMITMENT THEY'RE SCREWING PEOPLE NOW!!! Unfortunately besides the upgrade ads to pay almost $15 for what? This WAS a great app, but NOT ANYMORE. I Had this app forever & I really liked it, but I kept declining the upgrade, thinking I had the chance to keep my free app.. BUT they logged me out, Without explaining that it wasn't an option. & now I have to pay just to get my years of notes I have in the app... now to get my notes off this ish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously 5 stars. Updated, and now I have no saved notes 😕 it's blank"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Did you ever have someone you liked become an addict? A bright, positive and wonderful person becoming a creepy, whiny, needy shadow that can barely function to a tiny part of who they once were? That's my experience with Evernote. I sadly switched to OneNote and we are very happy together. Sometimes I think back to the happy times with Evernote and the 2500 notes we had together, but then I remember that I could not even batch delete them at the end and all l the other things that went wrong."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes limited to 50 is a joke... There are much better notes alternatives. Evernote is just EA in disguise"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer can access my notes, keeps asking me if I want to upgrade or try a free week.. which I don't, I need to know how to get to my notes and then I'm uninstalling it..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A Real Help!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now far too expensive for what the app can do when there free alternatives available. Also the constant badgering to upgrade with every click means I'll just delete the app instead. I would have paid a fair price but this is silly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The notes keep refreshing and the content that we write is lost. It's terrible and pointless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it can not get offline access now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote stands as a versatile and indispensable tool for digital organization, offering users a comprehensive platform to streamline note-taking, task management, and information storage. One of Evernote's standout features is its seamless accessibility across multiple devices. Whether you're using a computer, smartphone, or tablet, Evernote ensures that your notes and documents are always synchronized and readily accessible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like ever note It works for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've used it for years and like the functionality but the orice for a personal account is insane!!! the price jumped up crazy high from previous years so I'm thinking about downgrading because I really don't need the extras."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using since 2013, good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I need you to cancel my subsription and return my money £79.99 to my MBNA bank. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great so far"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive, too limited free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is my brain. Can't leave home without it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"absolutely love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been trying to cancel for weeks! Total scam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I had notes since 12 years. Some of them got lost with the update. Luckily I could hire free trial and recover them from the history of note. It's a pity that Evernote has become only for pay users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Man, evernote used to be awesome for a free app. I considered paying for it but it wasn't worth the price. I continued to use the free version but the persistant pop ups to upgrade and now to attach evernote to Microsoft has sent me over the edge. I'm out, migrating my notes and not coming back. Pop ups ruin any app experience for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is getting worse and worse day by day. Getting to the point of uninstall and say good bye for better. It cost sooo much but it keeps crashing and very slow and takes for ever to get up and running."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app, even if I was annoyed by it asking me to upgrade to the paid version every time I open. It did what I needed, which wasn't much, and it was simple to use on my phone. Can't use it now because it's asking me to sign-in, but won't load past the login screen no matter how many times I tap the button. I wasn't asking for much with this app, and they still under-delivered. I'm glad I could recover my notes through my PC browser. Though, that's the only redeeming quality about it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I Can't Afford! I liked it a lot, but to pay such a high price for note 📝 taking is just far too expensive!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I enjoy having everything in one place"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app. Deleting because of all the pop ups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nice app marred by constant nagging for an upgrade. Every time I open the app, the first 4-5 steps are just me telling I am not interested in upgrading. Everyday they thrust a ""one time offer"" to upgrade down your throat. They have the right to earn, but since I am not using the app to make money, I am never going to upgrade. Switched to a better app. Goodbye! Update: Switched to Notion. Far more features with a bit of learning curve. No ads, no pop-ups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely unuseable, I used to use it all the time, recently installed it again and everything is behind a pay wall, I don't k own what free features people are talking about I can't access any of my notes, everytime I try to look at anything the app begs me for $130 a year, get real your app wasn't that good to begin with and I can buy a hell of alot of real notebooks for that price. I won't be back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Line spacing is completely screwed up on android and has made the app unpleasant and borderline unusable. I need a phone that's 50% bigger to see the same amount of information as a normal note taking app. Evernote is broken, and it appears that massive negative feedback has zero impact. Don't download until it's fixed. At this rate, I won't be renewing my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Interface of microsoft onenote is better than this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be a great app that I recommended to everyone. Now it's just bloated with lots of added new 'features' that have ruined the greatness if it's original simple functionality. Maybr pogrammers and developers should be contractual as they seem to unnecessarily add and change things for the sake of it as they're employed full time. As a great designer once said, sometimes ""Less is more"" - Ludwig Mies van der Rohe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used for a week, had no idea I would lose access, be warned, I had to sign up for a free trial to retrieve a week of work, absolutely shadey behavour"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be pretty good. But every time I need something I noted urgently, it takes forever due to all the ""special offers"". I just need a very simple place to note down very short basic data and then to be able to retrieve it quickly, and delete it. This app is not suitable for that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update removes being usable for free. Extremely limited features unless you pay. No longer can recommend this app. Once was great tho. Is Company in financial trouble for such extreme restrictions in free version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be useful for shared journaling, until they paywalled having more than one notebook (so it's impossible to share with anyone) and also paywalled the basic functionality of the app: writing notes! Have to migrate years worth of notes now so I can delete this useless app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used the free version of this app for awhile. Decided to try the free trial for the paid version. Needless to say, busy week and didn't really get to use app much to see if I wanted to continue paid version. Forgot about it and noticed on my bank account that Evernote had withdrawn a full years price from my bank account not once but twice. Contacted them through email to get this resolved and gave them proof of deduction and haven't heard from them since. Another sham company I guess"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're actively trying to make this app worse. I've been using it for years, and it used to be my goto app for shared notes, but now I have to close an ad as soon as the app opens, then again to get to my notes, then confirm that I want to close the ad, then close the new ad I get for opening an actual note, then confirm, then close the reminder that my note space is limited, and once again confirm. Was that exhausting to read? Imagine having to do it every time you want to jot something down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to all my notes??? First I get locked out and can't log in until I install the update. Then when I do that, all of my previous notes are just GONE!!! How do I get them back? This is the worst app and the worst experience I've ever had with one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been usong this app since last 10 years. It was one of my favorite app. But now it is getting the worst app I ever used in my life. Whenever I copy paste something it takes awhile to get ok button and after that ✔️ button doesn't work for several minutes. I am looking for alternative app now. Ahh! I have lost thousands of hours of works on saving notes. 😥 Its new update (2024) on android and PC ultimately compelled me to leave the app because I can't make a single note now im free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even use the app any more. Everytime I open the app it forces me into multiple full page adds to pay ridiculously large amounts of money to use a basic notes app. If it was reasonable I would consider it, but 15$ a month to take a few notes is rediculous. Can't even make any new notes. Looking for another option. these people are nuts and I'm sick of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just like everyone else is saying, used to be a great app and is horrible now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Got too tired on the constant nagging about upgrading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't retrieve any of my notes contact me for information on how to get my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was the best notes application available many years ago. Now it's far more expensive while also being considerably less useful in every way compared to a decade ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I went into it a couple of days ago And found that I don't have access to any of my notes. The only thing I can do is either do a 7-day trial or a year subscription. Is anyone else experiencing this? Is there any way around it to gain access to my notes? I have been using this app for so many years, that I don't even know how long it's been. I love this app, or lovED.. The way they are doing this is wrong."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Era bom mas começou a tirar algumas funções que são disponiveis para quem $$$. Não assim é tão indispensável a ponto de pagar por esse app... Se restringir mais vou desinstalar. E tem que parar de perguntar pra assinar seus planos, muita chateação."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't create new notes when using the app on my OnePlus 7 but works fine on my laptop. Please fix"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why can't I open it on my phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"hate the intrusive AI feature. especially in the note editor. Let me OPT OUT! it's so Processor heavy now- it barely rubs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Line spacing is really screwed up. I don't know what happened but I want this fixed ASAP. Nobody likes this, so please fix this. This is UNACCEPTABLE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stated in the app that the free version can create up to 50 notes. I only have 22 notes so far, but now the app no longer allows me to create any new note and forced me to upgrade. I've also deleted old notes to reduce my number of notes even more, but still also won't allow me to create new notes. Rubbish statement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be the best app for taking notes but now the Premium subscription ads are very frustrating and forced me to move to another app for better convenience and peace of mind ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This the the terrible Evernote App , they deducted from my credit card tool away my cash without my permission for $105 . Terrible. I will call all my friends not to use it after one year ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, been using the free version for over a decade, weird to see it get worse every update. I was planning to eventually buy but now I never will. I just wanted a simple note app that syncs with my pc, none of these added features they want to charge for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"its getting slower and slower"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let you sign in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. The new system of forcing users to pay a ridiculous amount of money just to use it is very disappointing. It was a really useful app too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Stop nagging me to pay every time I open the app, and purposefully making it difficult to access my notes. What happened to this app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Keep up the great work!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The sketch feature on my Samsung tablet is glitching. Please fix! App has, unfortunately, only gotten worse over time. Notes don't even open without the app crashing!!! You had ONE JOB!! smh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome organizational tool. I use it at home and work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Still the best notetaking and task manager app. Cross platforms. Excellent, always improving"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to pay 40 euro .... Evernote...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"STOP ASKING TO UPGRADE. IT'S ANNOYING. NO MEANS NO. WHEN I DECIDE TO UPGRADE I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN ACCORD. Way to destroy what used to be a good app, along with your reputation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't want paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is a very useful App, it might take a while to learn but it's well worth it. I have used it for over 8 years now...I am still finding new things I can do with it, plus have all the info I acquired from the past 8 years accounted for and organized...As I said before, well worth the time and money invested..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am so sick of the enormous amount of pop ups! It's so frustrating and making using the app so unappealing and difficult. Everytime I open the app and/or open a new document it pops up and asks if I want to upgrade, when I say no, it again asks if I'm sure! Really?! I just want to jot down a freaking note, and I get so frustrated. I wish I could somehow export all my notes to a different app, because I don't wish to use Evernote ANYMORE! I've used the app probably 10 years now so I can't switch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New home screen is unhelpful. I need to access the notes & tasks I already created. The widget screen being your default ""home"" screen when opening the app was far more useful, but now I have to open the menu and click through to it, then click out and come back in because the notes/tasks don't load the first time & I can't find an option to change my default screen upon opening. Please change it back or give us the option to choose our default screen on Android. And yes, I'm a paid subscriber."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and used it for many years. The constant pop up ads, followed by more ads has made me find better options. Just uninstalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Someone tried hacking my account 2 times in February of this year. From 2 different countries, and I would only use one specific email for this app. They tried hacking from Vietnam and Belarus I have never been there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it just constantly wants you to upgrade and the upgrade is an insane amount. it limits your notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"LOVED this app, used it to journal for over 750 entries. Then my premium expired. Both the android AND windows apps started begging several times daily for me to sign back up, commonly interrupting my writing and requiring multiple inputs to close the pop-ups. I will miss some of the features EN offered but I will NOT miss the corporate panhandling. Bummer when a good app gets bought out by greed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had enough of this app. I've used Evernote for years, and it was a standard install on all my phones and tablets, but unstable updates and purchase nags ($130, are you kidding me?) have finally made me uninstall it for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was really good before... It was fast and simple. Then they bloated it with unnecessary features to the point It loads extremely slowly. What is more, they show so many ads that the app is now simply useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used be good. But now the worst app of it's kind. Asking to paid for even it's basic features. I had Evernote since 2015 ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to use with free plan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was at 17 of 50 notes in the free version. Can't create more because I'm at my ""limit"" Constant pushed notifications to upgrade. I would pay for it if I was actually at the limit. Had Evernote for 10+ years. Uninstalled for good today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years, almost since the beginning. For ADHD help, D&D notes, school/work notes. What the heck happened?! HOW can you continually make things worse than before and continue ""updating""? Just stop. Make it better or just stop..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every day is worse. Bye evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"'Ransom' app.. gives a decent limit then take it away.. like take a lot of the note limit away and charge exorbitant amount yearly. People with existing data won't be happy at all. 50 note is not even decent. I might as well use some digital post-it app if I only have less than 50 notes. Update: What?! Have used this app since my last update but looks like this app is not dead yet with their high subscription prices? Reviews do show how bad it has become..lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2018 and it's been my favourite. However, lately all they keep trying to do is corner you into paying for the app. I've had well over 80 notes and 4 notebooks, now I have to delete all my precious memories just to make even 1 more note. The limit on what nonpaying users can do is insane. I literally can't use the app anymore even if I wanted to"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's sucks! There are multiple bugs that have been present for the entire time I have used the app: Sometimes when going from a header to normal text and vice versa, the font size doesn't update. Sometimes the 'Update to Match' feature bugs out, from not updating to giving the text a random configuration. On top of all this, they expect you to pay $129.99 a year to use across multiple devices, while Microsoft OneNote does everything this does and then some, for cheaper. Not recommended at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's gotten totally unuasable since they started pushing the subscription. Can't do anything without clicking through multiple screens that make it look like you can't proceed without subscribing. Does nothing my phone's built in app doesn't do and that app is actually free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It is the most intuitive program I use. Packed with so many features! Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very money minded"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Before i give it 5 stars coz it is free to use,but now after years of using it for free they always offering me to upgrade my acct, i always refuse it. And then one time they log me out to the app, then when i log in it again vioala all my docs and files and also my bank acct details are also in it, it vanished. And i dont recover it.. It was a bad experience i thought i found the best app even it has limitations because of its free version. 👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The ability to sync Evernote with the calendar of choice is a game changer! The notes are organized with action items where the user can set due dates and general notes bullet points. A reminder to create the note right before a meeting is fantastic. Great job team Evernote! 🏆"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"04/2024, no access to my account. So I paid for free trial (to be canceled). I STILL CANNOT ACCESS MY ACCOUNT because they say my Gmail password is incorrect. NO IT'S NOT! And why do I need to enter my Gmail password anyway? Evernote cannot be updated on my older phone anyway. I just wanted to see my shopping list."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved the app UNTIL ... I updated the app and lost all all of my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be so easy.... Now they keep adding more and more pop-ups begging for their overpriced subscription. I've used this app for more than 10yrs, but I have to find something new. They're out of control with greed, and the new layout is worse than the original."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The new start screen is super annoying. Particularly on the android version, but not iOS? Back to 4 starts if you give us a option to return to dashboard as default."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had been using evernote since 2016. Earlier it was a very useful app with simple outline and only sharing options were paid. Now , even making notes has become limited and almost impossible and yearly subsription cost is comparable to that of windows itself. I am leaving this app and writing this review in memory of a once beautiful and simple app. Adieu"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's recent restriction to one notebook or 50 notes for free users has rendered it nearly useless to me. What's the use of a notepad that strictly limits your notes to just 50? There are other alternatives offering more generous plans for free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over the years they've made it worse and worse and worse. It's time to give it up and move into alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has gotten more and more unstable over time and now, like others, I cannot open any notes on my tablet. Immediately crashes. I've been a subscriber for many years and I give it a week. If there is no fix in a week or two, I will save all my notes in whatever manner I can and use this as a fine reason to finally switch to another app. I don't care if this is unreasonable. I don't care if there's no good way to export elsewhere. I have reached my breaking point with this once fantastic tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Edit: I dont understand how an app thats largely dealing mostly with text can be so slow and unresponsive (in this era of video). I end up having to use todoist to actually note what I need to on evernote. Evernote accept my quick note offline, and sync it later. Looking for alternative note app honestly. Sharing notes folders with team is broken. Many notes never sync and dont even report problems. App not even loading. Where are the widgets in the new update? Old widgets dont work any more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm a long time user, and greatly appreciate the recent improvements. Most of them are very good to excellent. This software is becoming more and more useful. The Android version is also constantly improving. With recent improvements to elements like calendar, I find I am spending more and more time in Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be great but now with the constant pay 60% offer etc and unable to make new notes until I pay is a put off. Apples notes does better, there's also Good Notes. I been using Evernote since 2015. But it's time to leave."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Extremely limited if not paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be an excellent app for a decent price, then they updated it and the app both for Android and for Windows became glitchy and unmanagable so that i had to uninstall it from my laptop as it was bogging everything down. In the phone it went from 1 or 2 seconds to open a note, to 10 or 15 seconds or more with the ""update"". Finally, I could not longer export all of my notes as I used to , but had to spend hours exporting 9000 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to pay Evernote at least for 4 years because it was super helpful like a second brain (when Phil Libin). At the time would get any merchandishing Evernote published (I trusted the vision of the company). I stopped paying when after a feature it became so slow in my devices I even wrote several times but they just avoid the question saying just to reinstall. I was willing to go back if they fix it but instead year to year the app is offering less and less value so it's time to say BYE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads for buying subscription pops up everyday, everytime i want to see my notes. Im tired of it and decided to uninstall so i qant to close the account, even closing the account so difficult. You guys just made your app trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just wanted to take notes, not subject myself to incessant ads for me to pay over $120 a year so that I could take notes. When you go bankrupt and your servers die, I'll still take notes on pen and paper or go full caveman and carve notes into the cave wall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your developer sucks. Says incorrect password, i need to try multiple time with the same correct password in order to login. I'm premium user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Prompts you for a paid plan EVERY time, frequent useless popups. All I want to do is write down basic text notes: this is not hard. Do not use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful constant ads and pushing to upgrade. much better alternatives out there that have better features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eu até gostava, mas agora para abrir UMA NOTA tem 40 propagandas que eu tenho que fechar. E sempre é uma oportunidade que jamais voltará de acordo com eles e não passa algumas horas e a mesma volta. Ou seja, não basta a propaganda invasiva, ainda gera uma segunda janela completamente desnecessária e que atrasa mais. Até consertarem isso, fujam desse aplicativo e se forem assinar, assinem de outro. EDIT: ESTOU MIGRANDO, SÓ PIOROU, FUJAM!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app with non-existent support. I frequently write a note only to come back and find it blank with none of my writing saved. Doesn't sync between devices. Completely fails at the one thing it's supposed to do because the developers hate you and are only interested in making it more of a bloated mess. I only continue to pay for it because it's too much of a hassle to move 10+ years of notes to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"For the last 6 months the app has been nagging me to get a paid subscription and I can't access the notes straight away. Otherwise very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible glitchy UI that deletes more than you tell it to and gives no way to move any info entered into the app. Copying and pasting results in a blank clipboard. They also took away the capability to create a new note if you don't pay $10 a month. I literally had to screenshot a note in pieces so I can transcribe it to a better notes app later, and sacrifice the rest. Permanenetly deleted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was a good app until latest March 2024 update. Deleting all notes I've had intact. I'm in note, SelectAll, Copy, suddenly it deletes all data with no way of undoing or retrieving the data. Gone like a flash! It wiped out 3 of my notes already, and there is no support. Their support is email with directives that DON'T EXIST in the Evernote app! Can't log into the Evernote website either. 3 browsers: keeps stating after I login: Does not support browser. They're all legit browsers too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app for notes across multiple platforms but now I can't barley use it & it keeps trying to force me into paying for it. Why would anyone pay for an app that keeps notes... Ridiculous, I will no longer be using this app & everyone else should look for a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So ive been using Evernote since maybe 2013 or so. Does kinda suck that they have paywalled everything. Like I get it. But feel as though, those who were here in the first few years should have at least the ability to write new notes. Every company wants to monetize everything these days. Kinda sucks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Удаляю приложение после восьми лет активного использования. Больше оно не выполняет никаких функций – бесплатный тариф поддерживает лишь 50 заметок, а за эти годы у меня их уже тысячи, и больше создать нельзя 🤡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free plan has been cut and cut to the point there's not much you can do with the free version. Won't let me create notes yet I only have 5-6"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got logged out and not able to sign in using Google sign in. Also, updated the app still nothing is responding."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sign in with gmail is not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Worked well until it let me make a new important note and save it and update it three times. Then it erased that and two previous notes and said I had reached my limit without upgrading. Why would I pay to upgrade an app that just deleted necessary information with no warning?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app because it was a great way to keep my notes on some of my hobbies organized and in one place. They did an update at the end of March and discontinued their legacy. I have had this app for years and all my notes after March 22nd disappeared after I completed the update. I reached out to customer service and got an automatic response and no help in retrieving the notes that were supposedly synced. I will not even consider paying for this app now. I'm going to start using Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"been a user for years. consistent improvements! won't be leaving anytime soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ruined the app, everything is locked behind premium now. Even the amount of notes you can create. Thank you for runing an app I have used for years, goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be good, now it crashes alot or just kicks me out the Note and goes back to the home page."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only rating 1 star now, got new phone and it won't let me access my notes 🤕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be great. Now, it just keeps relentlessly pestering me to upgrade to the paid service. I think it's time to find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For the past few months I get anoying pop-ups to upgrade every time I open the app. As I use it just for some occasional notes I might as well switch to a different one. This one is way too expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Recent changes in user interface very confusing. old one was good. you put into some wiget option, which can not be saven as main view.. very confusing. I kept some handy/regularly used notes in shortcut, which is fully gone. every year price also increasing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved it but hate it after my many changes they've made to the app in the recent past. One of the worst was being forced to switch to premium every time you opened the app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"بطل يشتغل حاولت احدث لا يتم التحديث حذفته ومش عم يرجع ينزل"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Heyy obnoxiously greedy people! You are now asking for annual subscription rates of around 5000 INR to 6000 INR. When exactly did you lose your mind? In India even the premium movie streaming apps dont charge that much. Why would you want only rich people to have access to your services Evernote? Change these plans ans rates or you are doomed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started using in 2009 and paid. Now migrating to OBSIDIAN. The original Evernote Devs envisioned an app that would last many decades if not a hundred years but the new owners including Ryan Reynolds (or his money manager) want to end it in 2 years. With all the bugs including slow loading and syncing, still unresolved even for paid accounts, now they want to limit you to 50 notes and 1 notebook. No thanks. You guys fired all our beloved devs and are ruining everything we loved about Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am amending my review from 5* to 2 since you've decided to limit the amount of notes I can have on the free account. There are other apps out there that don't do this. After I transfer I'll be deleting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great product. too much push to buy higher plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not recommended! Too many ads! In oder just to open 1 task, you need to klick several times in the menu and before each klick an ad pops up. Very disturbing! Also has very disturbing bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime you open it the ramming there deals down your throat, close the first one and another pops up then another, really annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am going to call this out as one of the words updates to ever hit a useful app. It used to have a useful home page. I lost my pinned stuff (which was one of the main things I used it for). The new app keeps crashing, it has fundamentally become an app I no longer wish to have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"suddenly you can't make more than x notes, get bombarded with a popup to get a subscription, app to slow, it's just awful. will not be using this anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What, almost 100% price increase. From $ 89 to $ 160. What world are you guys living? It is ok to increase the price but think about the people who pay for it as well. Double the price in 12 months. I know inflation and all, but. Shame was enjoying it. It's time to look for other options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time i open this app, i get non-stop messages to subscribe to subscription. This way of marketing is absolutely ludicrous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hate the update changes. With the new look and organization of the app, the notepad that used to be at the bottom of the home page is gone, and I have lost some important information that I had written there. I'm so pissed off. If anyone knows where they might have hidden it in the new version, please let me know! Why the heck would you delete a feature that people were actively using without saving the info from it somewhere??? Also, he new design makes accessing the notes I want so annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was honestly the best app to keep my notes in one place. But they have limited the free account access and now I'm not able to write a new note or create a new notebook. At this point, it's quite frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, and it's been my go-to for notes. It started to get rather annoying with pop-ups asking if I wanted to subscribe and then a second pop-up, making sure I was sure I didn't want a subscription. Recently, they got greedy and changed what you could have with the free app, and what I already had was over the limit, so I can no longer create notes. I only use it for notes and don't need all the extra. Transferring all of my apps to Google KeepNotes, then deleting the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"helps me keep track of my Things to Buy, Gym Routines, Passwords, etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used Evernote since it's launch - I'll never be without it. Invaluable for collecting (and organising!) thoughts, snippets and ideas."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app was great when I started using it years ago. Recently the amount of screens that you have to navigate through to gets past the constant push to upgrade has become obnoxious."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been a user for years now. Up until recently my experience has been very positive but all of the sudden I'm being limited to 50 notes and everytime I try to use the app it keeps pushing paid subscription in my face. I'm rating a 3 bc it is still free but my frustration is rising and I'm going to look for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great for Bible study"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The amount I'm paying annually for this app is no longer worth it for me; not only is it getting more inconvenient to use, I don't use more than some basic features (multiple notes and notebooks). With the recent update, the Home page is no longer ""homely""; now I've to take more taps just to get to Shortcuts, when it used to be the first thing I see every time I log in. The formatting for mobile is quite unlike the desktop's; which is a bummer because I use the app more than desktop Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Every update has made this app worse. It won't even open on my phone at all since Jan 2024. Reaching out to cs made no difference. I gave 1 star extra because at least it still opens on PC. Highly recommend to stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use Google keep notes for free😎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE APP! Update made a good app horrible! How do I revert back to a earlier version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"would give 0 if i could. starting to think the people who made this app are missing some brain cells since they constantly find ways to self sabotage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye. It was fun while it lasted"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bring back the old widget. why fix something that is not broken? now this app is so frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$130 for a notes app is pure crazy, and all the annoying pop ups will never change my mind. Awful new strategy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"locked down so tight you can't really use without paying $130/year"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Miserable. Fed up with changes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the latest update, I can no longer log in on my phone (Android). The two step verification is not functional. Even before that, the app had a tendency to lose the last data entered and refuse to copy and paste reliably. Can't say I'm interested in paying for the premium version when the fundamental features of a note-taking app haven't been nailed down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Same as some other reviews, they got too greedy. I've been using the free version for years, but I switched to Google Notes because Evernote spams you with pop-ups to upgrade to a paid subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love the app since it gave a clean note taking and sorting experience with plenty of additional features for those that need it, but it recently keeps shoving premium subscription requests in your face every time you open the app or open a note, and makes it a hassle to navigate the app for free. The premium cost is also insane for a note taking app, and it no longer allows me to create additional notes without the premium subscription. 0/5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Reliable for years... cross-platform! Don't forget to keep your corestuff obscureified, lest @klughillains@ imitate zh'Aur One-Amazimg-Trick!¿!°~"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to have very high recommendations for this product but they have really got greedy on their fees. $130 for this product is outrageous. Would gladly pay $20 annually, but I cannot justify this at $11/month. Too many free products on the market that provide the same or similar product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It all went so wrong. I have used the free versions for over 10 years and now can't make any new notes as it has a cap of 50 notes. It's unusable. I moved to Google keep!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So horribly buggy, lags forever and all your notes go out of alignment. It's like the company DOESN'T CARE about its PRODUCT or YOU anymore. You're better off looking at alternatives on GPlay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This company has lost its way. Prices have gone up significantly and the mobile app and desktop app have not had any improvements to warrant any of that price increase. Starting to export my notes and quit this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I loved using this app for journaling, but now I'm highly disappointed that they are now charging to continue to use the app and that the price is so high."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to my go-to note app but lately it's quite annoying if you don't have premium you can't create any notes.. If there was an option to rate zero, it would be 000"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Logged me out of the app, and now it doesn't even respond when I enter my email to login."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updation it is the worst app to use it cant handle even note with few lines highly slow typing one word take 10 seconds. Earlier this qas the best app but new version is worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for 10 years. Every year, I hope the app gets better but till now it is still buggy. I like to use it to journal my travel so it has to be done on mobile app. Many times, I just get frustrated after using the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"account not updated after paying by subscription in google play, no answer from evernote despite several attempts. where has my money gone? has anyone else had problem of disappearing money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has gotten worse and more expensive for what seems like no reason. I am moving to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good, but it's such a sloooow app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well Evernote, it was nice knowing you. Time to find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forced to upgrade to a plan sucks. Used it for 11 years. 7day subscription then ill be auto charged for $169 feels like a unethical practice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"it can really use a Linux dev package"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for years and used to be indispensable to me. Lately it's been laggy and the prompt to upgrade to premium is in the same spot as the button to make a new note, and when you're desperately trying to hold onto a thought to write it down, all of this frustration has been having me research better note apps to port myself to. Edit : morons managed to make it even worse; good bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible after the update. Changes unsaved, had many important things noted down which are now lost. Just horrible user experience. Glad Google doesn't have lower than 1 star rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Edit to add: The update that requires purchase to have more than 50 notes, NOT OK! I may be moving to another app. 🫤 It was good while it lasted. Downgrade from 5⭐ Original review: When I got my new phone, I missed the old Memo feature from my old ""dumb"" one. I went looking... and found evernote! Wheee! I could do checklists, pix, ""jot"" down thoughts for my personal writing, all kinds of wonderful and USEFUL features! And I can edit even when I don't have an internet connection!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"the web clipper has too many options. At times the choice I make looks good but deletes some info"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Plz my backup data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was the defacto note taking app but apparently they got greedy and went to subscription only. I deleted it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every update this app gets worse. Now they have introduced some totally useless new start page that they force upon the users. I don't want to start a new note every time I start the app. I just want to see my notes. Even if you have made a shortcut to one of your notes on your phone half the time the screen flickers 2 or 3 times and then goes back to this useless new page. The app is ruined. I want the old start page back 🤬."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful. Been using for years. Worth the money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Super irritating app now. It used to be a wonderful app but now it's annoying. A. It auto rotates even if my rotation is off in phone. B. Too many constant ads to advertise it's subscription. Why they need to bombard the advertisement to the face? I have officially switched to some other app after using this for nearly 5+ years. How can you possibly ruin the user experience? Learn from this company 🙄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Much improved with the new updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to really like this app for lists that I could check off, but recently they changed something about the format and the square check boxes aren't there anymore. Also, every single time I open it I get an ad to upgrade to their paid version and it takes a long time to try and get out of that screen so I can just read my notes. It's INCREDIBLY annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Interface varies between devices is a difficulty for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using this app for years and was so happy with it but the new update has made the app slower for me and there's a lot of pop ups now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was the best notes app for so many years including the free version was hands down way better than anything else. But not anymore. Now the free version has become extremely limited and has constant pop-ups for subscribing to paid plan. We have so many great free alternatives that there's no reason for Evernote anymore. Even the Google's keep notes app is way better. I really did like Evernote but I am afraid I won't be using it for very long anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly force closes. Paid apps should perform better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"$150 is completely bonkers. Increasing the subscription this much is absolutely criminal. I love this app, but I swear to God I will go back to paper and pencil before I get robbed by an app on my phone. Foh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Utter garbage, I used this years ago. Started using Obsidian. I remembered that I had some notes saved in Evernote. I sign in and am bombarded with subscription trash. What kind of scheme is this? Its notes. Glad to be getting rid of this. Nobody should pay for unlimited notes in 2024. $%&# right off lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"3/2023 Can't open app on phone. I have paid account but can't open it on my phone. I have used it for years with no problem. But now I can't access my account. 4/2024 Having the same problem again, it won't open on my phone. So I've uninstalled the app and reinstalling, hoping that will work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"in summary: a downgrade of the legacy app which has been decommissioned recently. Widgets don't work properly. No more shortcuts from launcher to tags or searches. More clicks to move a note between notebooks. personally, the new home screen adds zero value to how I use evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive and now there is a limit to how many notes you can have. No thank you. I'll be migrating my notes to another app ASAP. Sad because I have used Evernote for years. They have gotten too greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have used this app for years, but it's just getting too pricey when there are other alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love my Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be an excellent app that I was able to use on my phone and pc. After a recent update not only did nothing work anymore, but I was constantly being bombarded with popups asking me to upgrade and pay for other versions. The free version I'd been using was then capped and is now next to useless. RIP Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for the last 12 years or so. It used to be an excellent note taking app, but lately its absolutely terrible - for one, notes don't even save after being taken, and you can no longer take notes quickly as you are forced to watch a blank screen as the app loads (which it never actually does - forcing you to restart the app each time). There are also so many paywalls and adverts to move to premium its crazy. Unfortunately I won't be recommending this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now bombarded with subscriptions, ads. Layout changed, now have to go find my notes everytime i open the app. There are other apps available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using Evernote for years and now, on my phone, pretty much 90% of the time I open it up and search for something, it crashes! Talk about frustrating, and there was just another update and it was good for maybe one time, and now it keeps crashing. On my computer it's mostly ok but I have my phone with me most of the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I really like this app, it has the features I was looking. Great App!!! Highly recommend!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fino a qualche mese fa ok. Ora inutilizzabile. Dopo anno devo cercare un'alternativa."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I use Evernote regularly to save recipes and all sorts of documents. Also use it for notes, but I know I don't really touch its capabilities"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't update your Evernote! They have put a poison pill in it. Says Limit Reached. Splashes a Upgrade Screen constantly. I am dumping it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Poor performance- Evernote is becoming like M$ Window$ slow and bloated. Evernote used to open instantly on older devices. Now it's sluggish on all devices. New views leave you with. Wth is that note/list/task now? Time to look for alternatives and cancel subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slooooow even for a simple text search. Sad, was a good app in the past. Even palm pilot was way faster then evernote in finding simple text strings. Hope they get better at coding as this app is a monstronsity. I was forced to update but it made no differnce. Way over priced for simple text search function. Dont waste your time adopting this app if raw data storage and retrival is your primary goal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"don't store your data in this app... they will lock your data and make you pay to retrieve your own data... worst app ... bldy thieves"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have used and enjoyed the app for maybe 8 yrs. But recently it has become harder to use and enjoy since they have pop up windows set to make you ""upgrade"" to the pay versions and make it nearly impossible to continue to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"its great to keep notes and information. Its a little expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"part of life!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, used to go straight to the widget screen, now it goes to an action screen, so it takes me 2 taps to get to the screen I want. Can't you guys make it out configurable as to which screen to start the app in? Also, the widget screen is slow to load or doesn't even load at all. 10 year paying customer but it might be time to find an alternative when my subscription is up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very dissappointed with current state of the free version. Upto 50 notes is fine, but even after I have deleted most of them (I have around 15 notes now) they still do not allow me to make any new notes. What kinda nonsense is this? Gonna have to switch to an alternative now. Also, without regional pricing the cost is pretty high compared to other subscription services here, xbox game pass, Spotify, netflix, Prime video etc everyone is cheaper than a freaking note app. 450 rs per month, lol."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app needs to die"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for over 1p years. when evernote wasn't working for 3 days I contact their support they auto-respond a generic reply and never got back to my distress. I thought having a premium package will command more support but I can now safely say this company only wants your money and that's basically all they cared. Absolutely horrified to imagine the future of my notes given the direction the company is going."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's gone down hill sadly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for years, however now it became a nightmare. Evey time I open the app, I'm bombarded by ads begging me to subscribe. I've switched to a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my go to in college for not taking. Fart forward a few years and i hate app and the experience. If i had to describe my current 2024 experience with Evernote in one word it would be: Greed. You get to syn two devices, but the website counts as a device. If you try to unsync you'll get ""can't unsync more than 2 time a month"" That's greed and disgusting, ill be removing my account and making sure you guy's delete all the data you've collected"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Simple and Sweet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So, Evernote can circumvent my Google play store setting, to not auto update the app, which is my preferred setting because it's my tablet, my phone and I should have this decision. It's virtually making us hostage to their wims. This update is the worst, you really think as the home button seeing the buttons that you use to make a note, Task etc. {which I don't use) is better then the original homescreen that showed me my last interactions with the app? Think again! Big Fail!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's only a matter of time they will ask you money to access your notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many crashes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It takes FOREVER (days, weeks!) to download offline notebooks, and while doing so, it is impossible to access them! What genius did this UI ""makeover""? Been using it since years, and now totally hating it! Not even worth one star anymore! Edit: It's 2024 and downloading offline notebooks still takes FOREVER! How can you not fix this? What's the rationale behind this? Is anybody out there at Evernote to shed some light on this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years. I was patient with the pop ups and moving from 500 to 50 notebooks. But It has locked me out of my account, despite changing the passwords I can no longer access years worth of notes. I have never written a review but am so sad I can no longer access my account and the 100s of notes over the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been kicked out of my Android device acct because I'm a legacy customer, since 2014. It should be 1/2 star!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app will no longer work on my android ASUS tablet. It will not let me login into my paid account. This apparently requires me to purchase a new tablet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update : Please update, the auto rotation screen so annoying in mobile apps. I can not write note on the bed before sleep. There are no setting to turn it off even my mobile phone already off the auto rotate screen. --- Sangat bagus, cross device dan keren!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Countless updates... Sketch function no longer works properly on Android. Can only detect 10% of lines drawn"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I changed phones, so now I've 'exceeded my synced device limit"" and I can log on without paying to unsync my old phone. Forced pay, really? Bad move. I'll just dump my years of notes. Thanks for the lack of memories, guys!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The App was awesome before greed set in, they monetized it, and it became useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally broken after recent update, says ""no internet connection"". Android 8.0"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is sad that after several years of use I am pushed so hardly to buy a subscription. Lots of other alternatives, which are free. Good luck: at the market with such attitude you are not sustainable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Longterm user paid. Crashes every 15 seconds ...rinse repeat. Restart doesn't help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years, & it used to be great, but now, literally every click in the app is followed by a pop-up encouraging you to upgrade to a paid subscription- SO annoying! Additionally, I don't have access to the 50 notes that supposedly come with the free version! I only have 17 notes, & every time I try to add a new one, another irritating pop up tells me I only get 50, & I am somehow over my limit. ITS NOT WORTH THE HASSLE ANYMORE, I will be finding a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have 10 devices I want to disconnect. The onboarding UI is broken."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for over 3years never had any problem until a week ago. I wasnt able to access some of my notes, so i uninstall and reinstall now i am not able to login. Its saying my internet connection is poor and i should try again later. Its been 2 weeks later with me consistently trying to log in the same thing keeps coming up. Any advice. I depend on this app for work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The low reviews are from users on the free tier. Nothing else compares to this note taking experience and it is worth the money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without warning I have been subjected to a hard sell sales pitch and a demand that I upgrade for over 100$ or disconnect devices. I disconnected a device. Now I have lost all my notes for approximately the last 6 years!!! This was where I kept important histories of transactions, and lists of critical information. I cannot retrieve this nor can I duplicate it. This is devastating! Update: NO RESPONSE TO MY ATTEMPTS TO GET ""THEM"" (WHOEVER THEY ARE) TO RESOLVE ISSUE!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be excellent, now they want you to pay past 50 notes. I have 31 notes, but it says I have 50+, I Guess all they want is money now, use another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You've forced me to update the app, only to make it worse. It now constantly crashes. I have to go through an extra couple steps just to get to my notes and I can't take screenshots amymore. Well done. Now I have to search for another notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I ve been with evernote since 2012... It was a long journey.. And last day evernote put a full stop to it.. EITHER PURCHASE PREMIUM SUBSCRIPTION OR QUIT... It says that I cant add anymore notes without paying subscription fee.. So thats the end of it.. Adios amigos.. Took some time, and copied the entire thing to google keep.. Good bye evernote.. And thanks for being this greedy.. 😜😜👍👍we wont see again.. 🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a user of evernote since 2012 and I am very disappointed by this last update: everything is super buggy, offline mode doesn't work, search is not working, notes are not showing off. Very very very bad!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Some time ago it started to push several annoying daily reminders to buy premium version when in use, not possible to opt out. It's basically impossible to use it without the upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years, and I used to love it until recently. I could open it on other devices and have unlimited notes. I uninstalled it because I could no longer add new notes (I had 20 and it said my limit was 50), and I couldn't add to my notes without constant ads to upgrade. $159/ year? Pass."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I tried to login but it keep lying that there are no internet connection.I can go to other websites. These apps when they suspect you are removing what you store will refuse you from using the app. I deleted some of the items yet they are still there. Is this jow you fake the number of users for your advertisers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Day by day they are turning money minded. Earlier premium was optional now every day when you open the app, they ask to pay. It's irritating. They even limited new notes after 50 notes. Earlier it used to be monthly limit now it's on the whole account. Will shift to alternative. App is also very buggy and resource taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"too many bugs; especially in the most basic and vital functions like just copying and pasting or making bullet points... with such quality, should cost more like 2$ a month or be free with ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great app. But not anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"nice and easy to save your notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"What has happened to this app? All I want is for it to load on 'Notes' and let me write things. Instead I'm forever having to navigate a series of pointless homepages, especially given how much it loves crashing. Stop wasting time with AI tools that no one wants and just make the basic functioning work properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Support is nonexistent. They deactivated my premium account and I lost thousands of notes. No one there can tell me why this happened and how to recover, Ive been trying for weeks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the March 2024 update I am completely locked out from access. I just lost 15 years worth of note-taking. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This review used to read: ""Best word processor and organizer tool on the 'Market. I use it every day! Thanks!"" and did so for thirteen YEARS. The truly draconian devices policy and laughable pricing structure has made my love for this app a thing of the past. A paying user for over a decade and they want to charge more and more money for ever-decreasing utility and UNWANTED, UNDESIRABLE artificial incipience, and I have hit my limit. Good riddance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"greedy app. since few years ago, i just could open my note in a few SECOND, before it closed and asked me to buy the premium. and now it doesnt even let me to login (both manually and via google) AT ALL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App now limits your notes to some absurdly low number. I have used this app for years and have so many notes saved. Unless you want to spend $130 a year, it's pretty much worthless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app, no technical support which given the high price, is expected."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for a lot of years and now a can't log in anymore. It's ridiculous that I already paid for the premium plan for the whole year and now the app crashes. I would like evernote to help with this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app since 2015 but recently with the non stop attempts of pushing upgrades I removed my notes and moved to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using this for years and I don't understand how or why you keep making it worse. These days it starts on the wrong screen so I have to manually navigate to my notes. It takes minutes of waiting and often several full app restarts to get a single note to load. And for *years* I've had difficulty saving and closing a note quickly...it seems incapable of recognizing the back command on my phone. I've been paying for years, but if this doesn't improve I'm finding a different note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app since ~2011, but recently it's been ever-worsening as they put more features behind their paywall. Was finally forced to get a paid account just to access my notes... & then app wouldn't work withnew features. Tried to update, the app store said it was the newest version even though the app said it wasn't, so finally uninstalled & reinstalled. Big mistake. Now my app won't let me log in at all, says there's an internet issue but there isn't. & I'm now paying for literally nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pasting into a note no longer works. It causes the app to crash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All notes missing!!!! What did you do?!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"my app is new update but i lost my old notes and data how to recover pls guide"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this application since 2021. It was really a great application to store all the important stuff, notes etc at one place. It was good but after the new updates and there updated terms & conditions made it pathetic. I moved my all data on other applications i.e. OneNote & now deleting this application. Don't download it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for more than 10 years. Legacy version was the best ot the best note taking app ever. It was. Current v10 is very fat, unstable, self-conflicting. Customer support is aweful. Price is very high and recently they increased it by 1.7x No way to use it anymore! I'm grieving for legacy, which was a cool part of my life. Looks like evernote came to it's end."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow and buggy. Bad customer support. Bad UX. I was a premium user of legacy version for 10 years. But now legacy is killed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worse and worse after each update. I have been using this app for 13+ years. Recently, it limited to 50 notes only and constantly showed ads of expensive subscriptions. Today, after the last update, the Scratch pad was gone (or nowhere to be seen) as well. Going to uninstall and find a better alternative!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is supposed to allow for 50 notes. I have 10 but it won't allow me to make new notes, just tries to force the paid version on me. I'd give negative stars if I could."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awfull. At a point, they force us to upgrade to the paid schema, then make us cannot access our data if don't upgrade. Beware!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"extremely intrusive promos and ads for paid version every tome you use it if you just want to use the free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"About 12 years or more I am using evernote but presently its got very very annoying and too much popups for go to premium... And also only 50 notes are free after that required to go premium. A fall of 1 of great apps on playstore.. Simply UNINSTALLED..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to have a certain amount of notes per month in the free version. Now I can't even make one note without getting a prompt to upgrade because I've reached my limit. It's been like this for months and months; I have not been able to make a single note. They should have kept the free version accessible with the monthly renewable capacity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"i loved the application but just suddenly it didn't want to login and i can'y even get to the part where i change my password and i really needed the things i wrote thier"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"used this for my sermons going back 14years excellent tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's a shame the app costs now. I used it for many years, and it is amazing but had to uninstall because why do I want to pay just for writing notes when I could do it so many other places for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most featured but Virus content after giving all permissions to this app,chrome is attacked by malware content chrome automatically opening malicious websites"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App logged me out, login is broken, can't see my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As long as it was free it was a great alternative note taking app. I am just using Microsoft OneNote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a regular user since a decade atleast. After the recent subscription changes the app has limited number of notebook and notes creation. I don't mind paying for subscription, but the subscription amount is way too high for the basic features I use. Switching away from Evernote and searching for alternatives now or building one on my own."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was a fantastic note-taking app when first launched, but in the past 5 years the free features have become increasingly limited. I feel threatened to upgrade, and what's left of the free version is not very usable. Been a loyal user for 14 yrs but will be looking for a replacement app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Could not ask for more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not to many people can afford to pay for apps like this one that says to upgrade to sync. I'm one of those people who can't afford to pay for something like an upgrade to sync. To be able to use it at all. Please fix it so everyone including me can afford to use it without having to pay for an upgrade to sync! Because it's not fair to all of us. So please fix it! Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be my favorite note taking app. Not any more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Last versions is making the app unusable without paying subscription, even for very basic usage. Moving to oneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's been a week, march 23, 2024. Error and can not access my account and my notes. Please solve this problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to be a free Evernote user for some years and, initially, it was the best application for taking quick notes I have ever used. However, policies recently changed and Evernote became so restricted that it was not worthy anymore. I ended up deleting my account and loosing most of my information. I do not recommend it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024 This app will not allow me to log in to my account it log me out and when I put in my information it does nothing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like having all my notes, etc, in one place. If I need to write an email, text, or reply to something, it's nice to put it here on Evernote, where I can easily review, rewrite, add, and correct what I've written. Then, it can be copied and pasted wherever I need it. The document can also be saved under any folder you've made, or you can make a new folder and then save what you've written. I absolutely love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app since 2012 and I'm fed up going to convert everything to Google keep and drop this app that constantly blocks me from doing a damn thing with popups to upgrade. Screw this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can't print off android phones help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used the app for years and loved it but recently it's become so frustrating to use because they've clogged it up with so many ads blocking the way to my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not letting me change due date"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashes on my Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite when trying to open a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm one of the pioneer users, been on Evernote almost as long as they've been around. Of course I have a lot of notes. Now they disabled all older versions, and limit you to only 50 notes. 50???!!!??!!! For something like 10 years? Great way to get rid of all your oldest and most loyal users. Can't downvote this enough. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"constant advt,paid version is too costly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible new update. Disfunctional and slow, thumpnail pictures are missing, notes missing pictures. Don't like the new update. Evernote is missing the boat more and more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Useful System changed reducing the amount of storage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It has stopped working on my phone, since i did upgrade, please how can this be fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and the past few they've really pushed for me to find a better app with all the subscription stuff. After limiting me tonight when I needed a note, I've finally moved on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't login ..... it always shows that network error..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paying premium but now can't even log in to the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had evenote since 2017. Lately they have been pushing buying extra stuff. That's fine but not every 5 minutes. I had the free version for a reason. I've Uninstalled and will not be using it going foward."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have enjoyed this app since 2012 but i do not enjoy it anymore. The latest aaargh is the home screen. I used to be able to launch the app and straight away i had my calendar, tasks, shortcuts etc now it takes me 2-4 taps to get where i need to go and yet the windows app hasn't changed. I am looking at alternatives. Sorry Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"very useful and good app until they made it almost unusable because removed almost everything from the free version. you get horrible subscription pop-up every time you open it. Very annoying. it changed from very good app to something you want to remove from your smartphone. subscription plans are extremely expensive, non sense for basic usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is awesome and I love using it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and now I can't add more notes because they want me to pay for a notes app. And I can't get into my notes without this app making me close 5 windows asking me to pay them. This app sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The limit on the number of notes is 50, I have 23 notes, but when I try to create a new note a pop-up window appears with ""limit reached"" message!! I tried to use it as a secondary notes app, but they are making it impossible to use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update removed widgets from Home screen. I don't understand why this change was made??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for 13 years but now they've doubled the price I'm going to cancel my subscription. It's not worth the price increase."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is sluggish (or dumb), without any advantages but with flood of Evernote company offers that are hard to skip. This app is almost malware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this for years! I loved that I could use folders and tags. I could even open it on multiple devices. Even if it was just 2. But they took that away. I was fine with that too until the most recent update. I can't make ANYmore notes. There's a stupid limit of only 50? I've had this for years I have over hundreds of notes all now gone. I'd rather use Google docs at least that's free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Don't just rely on this though for some reason, updating or whatever, I suddenly find myself having to sign in again on my phone, and it refuses to let me and goes round In circles😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Shite app. Asked to login, using google id makes the app redirecting to web page. When you choose your id it will try to sent an email to youself. Dont know what you code junkies took but this does work. So minus 5 star (hence 1 star). Good luck with fixing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO EVERNOTE...ITS LIKE ACCESSING A WEBSITE A DECADE. IT HAS BECOME VERY SLOW. WHAT ENV WAS THIS CREATED IN? I WOULDNT GIVE IT A STAR IF THATS AN OPTION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had Evernote since 2011 and used to love it. The last two years it's just obnoxious ads and constant pushing for me to pay for an upgrade. Moved everything over to OneNote, which I can use for free and has a more user-friendly interface. Buh-bye, Evernote, won't miss ya."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing... Now I'd rather use chalk and a blackboard. Useless Devs. Useless greedy Devs. It is a terrible app now. Awful. Deleted from ALL devices... RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All the people writing terrible reviews are right. This app used to be useful, but even doing something as simple as opening a note to write a grocery list or something becomes a chore with this awful app which I can only sometimes count on to load and work normally. It is by far the worst notes app out there, constantly asking you to subscribe for features that it should be offering for free anyway. These people do not deserve any money from you. You'd be better off with a paper notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I simply cannot and do not live without it. It's my life's major productivity hack and scrapbooking tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"its not responding..now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is invaluable to me. I have my entire recipe collection in it (over 20,000 entries) & I can easily find new recipes, all of them have pics. I can filter my searches & tag numerous things in each recipe. I can be in the store & bring up a recipe to buy the ingredients I need. I love it!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have lots of important file in Evernote. But now It's not working. I can't open my notes, even can't log in to the app. Very Disappointing🙁"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update cannot Create more Note. And subcribe cost quite high."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"USELESS, SHAMELESS, GREEDY, MONEY-MINDED, EXTREMELY BUGGY APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Consistent issues with accessing any old notes I had from years ago. I have tried several times to log in on my Chromebook with no success. I downloaded the app on my phone. It is now asking me to pay for a $130 subscription. I try to disconnect random devices synced to my account and it never continues to the next step of actually removing them. I used it to put my family history notes in and would love to be able to actually view them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New update has made Evernote even worse. Can't scroll through the note without having to get into the edit function while using my s pen on Samsung Galaxy Note which makes the app pretty much unusable. Feel like Evernote has really been slipping. I might start looking for a new note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every single time I open the app and try to open a note I am IMMEDIATELY taken to a page about subscribing. I don't want to subscribe and I want to stop having this pop up REPRATEDLY every time I open app and then multiple times within a few minutes when navigating. Absolutely going to copy my notes elsewhere and get rid of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doubled the price each of the last 3 years and is now SUPER EXPENSIVE. Plus, I now have so much info on it that I can't unsubscribe. I've been trapped. Don't get this and let the same thing happen to you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I strongly dislike this app. Tries to force us into subscription by holding our free content hostage. Don't use. It will constantly ask u to pay a subscription for what should be a free basic service that ever other app offers for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've made it useless with the new subscription model. I could add a couple notes a week and have them ready when I needed them. Now with 14 years of history I can't add new notes unless I pay triple the original monthly. It's a just a money grab now. 🙁"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app, but their constant pushing to upgrade is out of control"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please free your aap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have loved using this app for years! Please create a way for the screen to not rotate when the phone is turned sideways."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst support service I've ever experienced. When the app updated it logged me out and said my password expired. I've had the same account for 10-12 years but my email is old and inactive so I can't get back in because I can't receive a password reset. I'm going to lose 10 plus years of important life notes because support simply won't answer me? Ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Minimalist features emphasise appearance over functionality. Free version is getting less and less features. Limited ability to format. No calendar so you can't actually use it for a GTD system."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know what is wrong with my Evernote app,is not opening at all and i have deleted it to install it again,is still not going"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't remember why I stopped using this. Installed on Galaxy S7. Tells me I've got not internet, from all internet sources, all of which work fine. Searched the issue, found lots of other people with the same issue all being quizzed about where they're trying to login from, in 2020. Evernote are clearly not bothered by this. Pointless. Uninstalled. The search for a cloud notes app continues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good and useful. Recently it has become a very bad experience that forces you to upgrade the version. I will never recommend this app to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Works a lot better than it used to but very expensive for casual users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed is the killer here. A once great app I've used for years. Now it's just bloat and a constant barrage of pop ups to get you to sign up for their overpriced service that's only gotten more expensive and gives you less since. Breaks your heart to see."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Despite the high subscription cost, I've come back to Evernote after trying several other similar apps. I've been using Evernote for many years, and the only reason I tried others was due to high cost of Evernote. In the end, though, I back with Evernote because of it's virsatility and reliability."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I got stuck on login page and the continue button does not do anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hope you lose everything because you ruined one of my favorite apps in the world. I've been using this app since 2014 and couldn't bring myself to delete it despite the constant limitations and useless features you've added. Now, I have to export my notes and switch to another app. You're a bunch of greedy people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stupid , they went from unlimited notes to limit of 50 notes for free users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notion is better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"try some other app. it is worst one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use this to manage my life."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to go through a gauntlet of ads just to use. Not worth the annoyance for only basic note needs. Goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Upcharge to connect to additional calendar!? It's time to start looking for alternative note app......."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love evernote. Now I can't login and I have no option to update the app. Sort it out! I need to access important notes ive made!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote replaced a lot of sticky notes to keep up with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Isn't efficient, shuts down or doesn't open notes, very regularly even on a premium subscription which is pretty useless when it is designed to assist with making things easier. Absolutely no satisfaction with customer service either"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I did really love it. It was perfect for putting my workout and stretching routines in one place. Now they want to charge exorbitant amounts of money for this service that had been free for years. They claim the free version can have 1 notebook and 50 notes. I have 4 notes and they won't let me create anymore without paying. It's a flat out lie what they claim to offer the free user. I'm looking for an alternative to this. I don't want to support a company like that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I want to retrieve some data and It will not let me sign in with as many attempts to update the app as possible. Please fix it. Its not working at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been unable to login for over a week"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After forced update to latest, I can update but, can't create ""new"" notes. -While I truly believe we all perceive this reality in varying ways it appears that Evernote has slipped into a totally different dimension . Best of luck Evernote. Seriously; Since v10 struck the planet, I don't want to play anymore. Looks like it's time to move on to something else. The features that vanished were the features I used every single day. The Win10 v bit the same bullet. OUCH!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was good and was working fine till recently it automatically got logged out and I was not able to login. When I uninstalled and installed it again, all my saved notes from past 3-4 yrs are deleted. It's really bad, I trusted this app for a very long period and suddenly this happened. I am not not gono believe any random app like this for my notes in future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A simply awesome platform for note keeping.  Syncs with other devices easily.  Life-simplifier."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Liked the app until they limited the number of notes and notebooks. Since I used the app for school and writing and not for business (seriously, $130/year!) and there are other free apps that fit my purpose, I'm saying adios."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"THANKS FOR SUPPORTING"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"If u go back to the note it doesnt start from where u ended.. it irritates a lot Also it always refreshes so i always have to find where i was previously"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a bummer that I've used the app for years for free to just keep notes and now they went from free to $10 a month. Which is fine, but then at least create a way to be able to download all those notes and part ways."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the free version on my phone since 2014 - literally a decade. In the past few years, the user experience has been in a free-fall, with almost every click resulting in a series of pop ups that you are forced to click to. Yesterday they restricted the free version, with ZERO NOTICE, to a max of one notebook and 50 notes. I have over 500 notes, and their ""integrated export feature"" does not exist on the android version AND I was forced to share my email etc. with them to access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad app .... Not installing this App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ok ok ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Newer versions consistently have less functionality and more bloat, thus I have stuck to using legacy versions... Until recently, when it forced an update. Without the previous functionality it seems time to give up on this product after a decade or so of use. The same is true for the desktop version and internet searches indicate users have been giving the same feedback for years without any change. Sad. Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Not opne"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a paying user for years.. but have also been using an older version after trying out the new one. Why? It's much, much faster, and the text looks far better. Now forced to update like everyone else. When you open notes 30+ times a day like I do (to manage daily life), the extra load time per note is almost unusable.. I implore the devs to compare the two versions. Time it, the new version takes around 10 seconds to open a note - vs one or two before. UI and text are way more clunkier.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using Evernote since 2014 but After latest update, All my 10+ notes disappeared. This app can't be trusted. Looking for a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using this app for shopping list between me an my wife. Years ago it was great app for someone who wanted store some small remarks. But now it is annoying and usles even as a shopping list. And I will never buy your subscription for 99 eur it is realy overpriced for what i am using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The incessant, sneakily designed and inappropriately worded adverts requesting you to upgrade constantly are so irritating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others, I've been using the free version of Evernote for many years, 14 in my case. I would have happily paid a small annual fee to continue using what I used to get for free before the recent update, but £8.99 per month or £79 for the most basic subscription is much too much - that's the same price I pay for a family subscription to MS Office. The 50 notes, 1 book limit is far too low to stick with Evernote's free service so I'm going to move my notes elsewhere and close my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed after many years using this app & one I recommended to others. Not anymore! Suddenly today I was unable to access the app with my login. Updated & now told I've reached my 'free limit' (?) Stopped me adding any new notes unless I pay an outrageous £79.99 a year! I'd never have bothered with the app in the 1st place if it had given a limit (even for free). Plenty of free note apps just as good. Bye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10+ years user here. I've given v10 a chance on multiple occasions but it is very unstable, so I've been using the legacy app, which is now unusable - searched online, only to learn that legacy ended on 26 Mar. No notification received beforehand. And this is what you get from the latest update as a free user: ""Your current plan limits you to 1 notebook and 50 notes. Upgrade now."" I've moved to Joplin but still kept some old notes at Evernote. Time for full replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. Been using evernote since 2012, and suddenly I can't create new note because apparently I have 200+ notes and 10 notebook, when the new update only allows 50 notes and 1 notebook for free user. Could've been better if the new free limitation apply to new user, but no, they decided to enforce this to everyone. Also you can only use Evernote in 2 device. With ridiculous subscription price just for taking notes, I see no justification for me to spend that amount of money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Current user experience is a huge drop from the good old days under original mgt. Whoever the new owners are. Shame on you. Youre running evernote into the ground. You expect customers to keep using with your current way of operating? Newsflash... No"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Talk about overkill on the constant (verging on harrassment) notifications forcing you to upgrade, used to be nice to work with, utter trash now. Good! be greedy and get the avalanche of negative reviews that you are recently garnering. Deleted and discarded this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Goodbye Evernote. Now that the legacy app has been killed, this 15-year daily user will look elsewhere for personal knowledge and task management."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Was better without the forced close of a buy me tab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep pay walling more and more features until the app will be completely unusable. A great app killed by greed. Sad. One star is actually too much. 1 notebook limit?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"FORCED EVILNOTE UPDATE! NOW AN AGGRESSIVE ADVERTISING APP! This sucks now, forced A.I. upon us in this version & desktop refuses to sync unless you downgrade to the forced A.I. Mobile is just for constantly advertising at you. It's no longer fit for original purpose. I'm not a heavy Evernote user, just use it for a few of daily reminders & to move notes between phone and desktop. Now I'm going to have to spend MONTHS OF MY TIME copying every note I ever created to another application. 👎💩👎💩👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eror after updating, cant log in.. i lost my important datas"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Was the best app, now useless. 1 notebook and 50 notes is a useless free version. Basic features have now become ""premium"", but are not worth the price tag. Moving on to another app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I grew up using this app and it used to be a great companion but I don't know what happened, now it's just a useless app at this point. Money grabbing useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It only gets worse! Stick to bending spoons stop destroying good products with hopeless software. What a disaster the latest Evernote update is. Made it completely unusable for day to day use; looking for an alternative. A previously great product ruined by poor updates. Are you going to fix it or roll back, really fed up of waiting for it to work (see your user rating is plummeting...)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be so fantastic that I actually paid to have a ""premium"" version or whatever. It went drastically downhill the last time I updated it. Now it's even worse. I went to open the app & it had kicked me out. I had to update to even log back in & now I have to pay MORE to have more than 1 notepad/50 notes? Absolutely ridiculous. Greed has ruined what was once a great app. Will be moving on to another way to take notes. If I could give negative stars I would."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blocking current users with older versions of the app from accessing old notes is not cool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used the free plan for year's and it was fantastic. I am now looking at alternatives due to evernotes absurd new limits."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used the premium plan till but trying to escape ASAP. The price went up by almost 50-60% and at the same time it more and more difficult to use. The windows version is always offline. Even before that I could not delete or move notes or notebooks. The search is awful, if you think you can find a note using a key word.. Forget it. Looking for alternatives as we speak."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after receiving the message of ""new version available"", I can not login anymore. what's wrong with the new version ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Told me i HAVE TO UPGRADE or i wudnt be able to use, updated and it is giving a error, so im not allowed to open my docs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Want to cancel it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started off great, became greedy and trashy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to upgrade for Android 8.0.0. Unable to browse on Chrome."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Being forced to use the paid version after using it for so long is kinda scammy because now I just can't use it since going over the notes limit. Would rather pay a smaller fee because I litterally just make notes nothing else... I preferred the app to others because of their search function but 8.99 / month is far too high for the little features i use.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please ignore this app.beacause only premium member can use new notes or recover notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be a good app. No more. DO NOT USE EVERNOTE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"In 2008 was excellent . Degraded year by year. New update does not let me in. Shame on you. I have 5872 notes for 1.8 giga. Shame on you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing recently"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps on saying update the version , version unsupported. But there's no new update notification here in Play Store. What's this ? I can't logged in now. Do something asap. I have my documents, writings in Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gives error in login. Unsupported version. I have updated it to latest but its still let me login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved the app newer versions became buggier and slower now the newest version is being forced and it won't even install."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update is sh*tty... Bring the old free version back!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"3/26/24 - The required update is a nightmare that won't install on my android phone. After many years of using Evernote I'm going to have to look for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Poor you have to keep upgrading it when"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst ever policy update ... Going to uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's unusable now. Used to sing this app's service religiously, was perfect to organize my writing, but they've hiked the price to ridiculous levels and free plan is now a demo rather than a working experience, esp. if you were a longtime (11yrs in my case) user and had more than 50 notes already. Pay or GTFO model lmao. Don't get this app, don't try it out, don't get lulled in by reduced price offers, just go for an open source alternative with better pricing and service. Goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have updated the new version but everytime i try to sign in, it displays the older version is not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't even bother! Will not update on my LG G6. Get into using Obsedian."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is the problem with this app? Whenever I am trying to open it, it is asking me to update, and when I open the Play Store, there is no update. Now tell me what should we do?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the hell Evernote! Multiple messages of version not supported, click here to update. No new version on the Play Store. Wow!! Effectively you have locked out users. If you do not want customers this would be the way to go. If you want to retain loyal users, please get your act together and sort out this mess. Going to start looking at alternate options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps telling me to upgrade on my android mobile so I delete it, go to the App Store, install it again, and it says unsupported version and I need to update it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Things were going downhill for years. They got bought out. Today they finally stopped support for the older version of the app I was using that still had a usable UI/UX. Nail in the coffin. RIP Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Charging $130 fo continue using an app that was working just fine and hasn't upgraded many of their features in the 9 years I've used it. Your competitors are doing much better and it's finally time for me to consider them. Take care."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be wonderful but is now sending me in an endless loop telling me I need to upgrade and then failing to give me a working app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From today March 26 of 2024 this app become the worst, make every one forcing to update the app to a useless version as 10.0 , please let people use version 8 again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app logged me out. I'm trying to login, they're telling me to update the app, but if I try updating, play store will tell me I'm using the latest version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Going round in circles trying to log in and trying to change password. Had enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Best app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"On my Andriod mobile App Evernote saying upgrade your App when I go to for update ,there is not showing update just written open.Even I delet the app and installed new one.But again same situation. kindly facing problem.Help me please"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very bad application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It is great, plus changing the background colour is a brilliant feature"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good - then you decide to pay money and have no way of telling their support that their app is broken. The app insists it needs the new version to run, so I install the latest from the app store - it still says version unsupported. Can't contact evernote either because they're SO modern that they literally have no way to contact them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful for the family"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me update, lost all my notes when I tried to update a couple of months ago"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not much helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gives the message Version unsupported and does not open."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for more than a decade, and one of my favorite features, the reason I re-subscribe each year, is the fact that I can write a note on any device and it automatically shows up on all my other devices. But today I tried opening it on my Lenovo TB-8605F, and it crashes as soon as I try to open a note. Updating and reinstalled didn't help, it's just not there. And I see I'm not the only one who's having this problem. If this continues, it won't be worth $60/year anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"constantly asks to upgrade, not the app it used to be"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The limit lowered and I cannot use bullet points everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rip off"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"almost unusable on the Samsung fold"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Plain annoying. Says you can have 50 notes for free, I got 38 and it blocks me. I installed many years ago, when it was unrestricted. I feel scammed..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps telling me to download new version but says it is installed. It is impossible for me to get the updated version. Very poor explanation. All my medical records will be lost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was my preferred note app for over a decade, but now they limit you to 1 notebook and 50 notes. I had multiple books before the change so now it won't let me make new notes without deleting notebooks. Easier to switch to a new service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"reliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"March/2024 Keeps getting better. Previous reviews. Update. Evernote is great again. ***Don't upgrade*** I wish I had a option to revert to previous version. I just upgraded to Evernote 10.0. And to my disappointment I cannot find the ""Add to home screen"" feature. It's has been omitted from the new version. I had many linked notes/ shortcuts on my home screen. Most of the links are gone, and I receive a message saying application not found for the short cuts that did remain on the home screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently capped notes at 50 without having to pay. Okay, got it, deleted 20 notes and I'm down to 30. Still won't let me add another more. App used to be fine, lowering rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid subscriber here - today for no apparent reason my evernote application stopped responding on my mac and my notes for the past 5 months are just gone. DO NOT USE THIS APPLICATION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app will literally drive you insane with its aggressive, neverending pop-ups harassing you into buying a ridiculous and overpriced subscription for a dang notebook app everytime you open it. Use anything else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Assalam-o-Alaikum Please don't stop this app. Previous experience was good. But now, it is not being update and you are directing to update otherwise you are going to stop this version. Why????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A note appears when I open the App saying that they will delete the current version on March 26 and to go to Google play, but I enter and there is nothing new to download, then I see that it has not been updated for a long time. I have a tablet with Android 8."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My second brain of choice. I have been using Evernote since 2019, and every year it gets better. I love it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a great note app, but I'm sick to the back teeth of these ridiculous, stupid, pointless and obstructive demands that i upgrade to some rubbish that i don't want. One would be enough, but every time i change note?? EVERY TIME?? If it continues you can stuff your app. It's appalling. I DO NOT WANT YOUR UPGRADE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was my fav app. But lately, it says limit is reached & also lagging so much. I deleted many notes yet it flashes limit reached message while creating notes. So byebye to your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Deduction of 3 stars for 3 reasons. 1. Evernote is not what it used to be. 2. I primarily used it for note making whenever I felt bored when I was younger, about 12 years old, I believe, but it has changed and I don't like the way it asks users to upgrade to Premium, like, can you just leave me alone? 3. The only huge red flag is that the app will stop working on Android 8, and it expects me to upgrade it, but all I see is the latest version and nothing else like the Beta or the Nightly version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Always been handy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Jump from Android 6 to 9+, are these kids having a laugh? After this force update my tablet is gonna become a brick lol... ITS ONLY A NOTE MAKING APP! Like all apps on the google citcuit now just obsolteting devices on older platforms. Think of the impact on the environment Evernote, shame on you for encourging this throw away culture. Im just going back to plain text files, like have existed since the 90s."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Finally, it's time to Uninstall, bye bye Evernote. You lost respect."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"In its beginnings it was my chosen app for note taking. I'd save my passwords and ideas. It was good. Then they decided to have that annoying pop up every time I open the app. It's so unpleasant to have to deal with that every single time instead of just being a normal pop up that stops showing up once you decide you want to stay with the free version. After a lomg search I found the app to replace this once beautiful Evernote. It has plans also, but it does not annoy me with pop ups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Uploaded application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and I have hundreds of notes- but recently they've added a note cap that's actually ridiculous ontop of the constant ads. I was planning on getting the paid version eventually but now I'm just jaded and looking for a new app. miss the old app 😔😔😔😔😔😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Epic app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app wad getting worse and worse and It officially became a completely useless app. Evernotrs marketing team has no clue how to make money with the app. So they removed basic free features and constantly bombard you with usless notifications. Switched to OneNote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great when I started using it, but there are now way to many ads trying to get me to upgrade. They are too difficult to close."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used this app for ideas and creative writing so I didn't need all the extra features for what they were charging but now they decided to take away general usability with the note and notebook restrictions. I think its a good app unfortunately the creators seem very money hungry so I am parting ways with this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A million features I don't use. It has become expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome app! put ALL of my lists on here!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Long term user, find it to be a very good app..., keeps important information readily available..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a subscriber for several years now and just this month I paid 14.99 for my subscription. Whenever I open the app I directly goes to the upgrade to $129.00 a year (hiding the monthly subscrtion) and that's something that I refuse to do pay for the yearly subscription when I've already paid $14.99 for the monthly subscription. All of my notes, sermons and other valuable notes are being held hostage even though I've already paid. So bye bye evernote hopefully I will find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EN has gone from being my favourite app to one that I can't bear opening anymore. The incessant prompts to upgrade are a worse experience than an app full of ad interruptions. I used to be a big promoter but have now moved to Notion for it's clean interface, flexibility and lack of interruptions during critical moments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The constant badgering about sales and premium pop-ups made me switch apps. I used this app for a while and it was fine, but now whenever I open it I get like 3 straight pop-ups trying to get me to upgrade to premium. It's a notes app, I should be able to easily access my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"cant update new version in my phone!! a52 5g with last android version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As others have said this used to be a great app, now the constant pop ups asking you to upgrade have made this app unusable. They have now introduced a limit to the number of note you can have on the free version so I'm moving to another note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Writing notes is not fluid with this Android application. I feel there is a very slight demay vetween typing and seeing the letters. Furthermore, the application is overall unpleasantly laggy and worst of all, the keyboard keeps popping down for no reason while I type. Too buggy for its own basic purpose. It's been like that for years now. Since a while, the app is litterally harassing me about moving to a paid version every time I open it. That's so much that the app has become unusable!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the app since 2013. Well, there were never any special offers or services for early users ,and I didn't mind that at all until they started to gradually cut out basic features to force me as a user to pay for my membership. I have nothing more to add. People have already said much down in the comments section. I am socked that I wasn't the only person to notice how greedy ever note has become. It's time to say goodbye with a one-star rating after almost 10 years of usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Baifas gomes gomes baifas gomes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't login. When I tap ""Sign up using Google account,"" it throws an error and closes. If the bugs are this bad before I've even opened an account, I think I'll pass."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best ever!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"has gone downhill. used to be simple quick and easy to use, now it updates all the time to add features nobody wants."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app before they changed the UI to spam us to get the paid version. And not only is there spam, but it won't let you create any new notes even if they're all within a single notebook and less than 50 as required for the free version. Guess I'm gonna have to look for a new Notes app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"TOO EXPENSIVE! More expensive than my office 365 subscription, have you lost your minds?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"gets clunkier and glitchier with every update. wish i didn't pay for the years renewal as it was $$$ and the app is no longer pleasant to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be a great note app, but I can no longer make notes due to a 50 note limit on the free version. That is fine, but when I have a total of 40 notes and try to create a 41st, it says I'm at my limit. Great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app is good but when I sync to windows and want to continue with handwriting using my pen, it should insert as sketch/image. cant directly writing as some other app can do. this app not for me right now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome way to keep notes in all forms--written, audio, photos, and web clippings. I really appreciate and highly recommend this app. I use it everyday 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"was excellent until I had to start paying monthly for it in order to keep all my saved notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The 4.0 must be due to the amount of reviews, or paid for. Each new update makes it less user friendly and less stable. Notes can be accidentally deleted and unrecoverable. When scrolling, if pressure moves beyond centerline, note closes. Unecessary to have multiple ways to do same editing, just makes it irritating. The frequent popups and banners to purchase the expensive professional version at $129.99/year is another annoyance. Quality keeps declining as price increases."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"RIP Evernote Legacy, i think you guys are taking revenge that we are happy with older version of Evernote. I moved to Notesnook and very happy with that. I was using Evernote since 2017 on both plateforms but you guys make it worst since you take over old company. In the name of improvement and UI change you guys make it more horrible. Now free users can't stay on your platform and you should named it ""Evernote - Only for paid users 🤑"". I wish i could rate -5 ⭐ but google doesn't allow me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great App. I use it ALL the time. I AM NEVER going to update UNTIL I Know that SYNC is Continuing in updates. SYNC was removed in the past. I AM Keeping the app the way it is with SYNC in the Android App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recommend exploring other note-taking apps like Obsidian or UpNote before trying Evernote, as the app constantly advertises and forces users to pay for a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Superb. No suggestions other than..Allow users to add music so that we can work and listen to something at the same time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Amoney extortion scam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is very slow when you're dealing with big notes. even if you're having your notes offline. it's all happened because developers decided to save money and re-write a cross-platform code instead of doing native code for each platform. SHAME!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is going bad to worse. Notes are not saved and synced. Losing a lot of data every now and then. Pop ups for upgrades are the worst of all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to rave about this app, but then they had to make an unintelligent change to the UI. Home used to display user customizable content, tasks, pinned notes, calendar. Now, it ONLY allows one to create new content, so Home is a really stupid designation. The customizable content is now located under the My Widgets tab, so we need extra navigation to see what we used to see right off the bat. The intelligent change could have been to add a create content widget for users who want it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Smooth"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good had all my information on the app medical mostly then greed caused the app to become paid I lost everything now I give it 0 stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"exceptional in document management."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2012 review: One of my favorite apps! Extremely useful, smart, and convenient! . . . 2024 review: This app has gone massively downhill since forcing the $20/month version on me. Every time I try to open a new note it crashes. I have more than a decade of notes on here, I'll be looking to move them elsewhere asap. This is absolute bull. Not worth $20/month. Not even worth $20/year."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"my exocortex."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limits number of notes and available devices. Constant pop-ups directing you to buy the paid version. Frequently buffers while blocking any editing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great, then the upgrades were so glitchy it wasn't usable. I got around the issue by downloading an older version, which was fine, but now doesn't work. I don't mind paying a bit but not £8.99 a month (madness when I just use the basic features). Please let users download previous versions that actually work and put together a pay model that's scaled eg for lite users affordable and maybe more expensive version for business users etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote is getting like Java back in the 2010's with more updates then reasons to use it... LOL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greediness at the top. I can't use this app anymore. Once I open it, the premium ad keeps popping up. Can this stop???? It's so frustrating. Might as well switch to a better app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"been a user and a fan for years and love Evernote. new things pop up and they each have their pros and cons, but Evernote has consistently adapted to meet user needs and help us help ourselves through our note-taking"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very nice way to take and keep notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app frfr really good for me and friends. Much bigger thanks to Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Takes forever to clip a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I am still dealing whether I want to upgrade or not, honestly compared to other apps Evernote interface is very user friendly but the price is a bit too expensive for my budget and is anual. Also only thing missing is to put a password in notes unless this option is added for pay plans"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A wonderful app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Часто дублируются заметки, появились проблемы с ssl сертификатом, что не даёт пользоваться заметками.

Теперь точно ищу новое приложение для заметок."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The new menu makes it harder to get to my notes. And I cannot get the app to work in my laptop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Fast quick,relyable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"they continue to remove features from the free version and badger you to pay for it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need to reduce the rating stars from the unchecked ones, lik dis app is just a programming test run, it's hangiiiing, can someone pls help wit some hangers lets hang dis app. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Im liking the new interface. Speed has improved. I'm excited to see where your headed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Now the free version says it's limited to fifty notes. I have FIVE notes and it tells me I'm at my limit, must upgrade to add another note. The pay versions are ridiculously overpriced. Run away, stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The crappification of this app overtime moving good stuff to premium and the constant nag to update to premium has made this app useless. Moved to Better solutions like Google keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Complete rubbish. Overpriced, too. Bin it and forget it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My plan allows me to create one notebook and 50 notes. I have one notebook and 16 notes and it will no longer allow me to create a new note unless I pay to upgrade my plan. Uninstalled. I went to Samsung Notes since it was already on my phone. It works fine and is free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App was great. I understand the need for them to make money but everything you click on seems to bring the pop up to sell you the paid service. It's almost unusable at this point unless you pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using Evernote more than 12 years and my subscription is over my iPad. Even my subscription is active, somehow Evernote system cannot detect it and it continuesly force me to upgrade which is I am at the moment. Support didn't prove information more than I can find over internet. What a pity. I'll move my all notes to Notion eventually where AI also supported"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Not work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works good. Good features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's okayish app, basic note app, but the premium version marketing is kind of aggressive and they locked the number of notes you can have behind paywall, so Im forced to change to something else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would happily pay a onetime fee for this service, but the subscription model is ridiculous and clearly just shareholder/managements greed. The sheer volume of afs, pop-ups, and reminders to try and get you to subscribe is obnoxious. Not to mention the 'x' to close it, or the link to 'remind me later' are all in different spots. I'm looking for an alternative because the reality is that I hate this app now when I used to use it all the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Decent app with great features. Marking as 2 stars though due to the constant barrage offers to sign up for the premium service. The intrusive campaign for premium sign ups has become so frustrating that I am looking for other apps to replace this one. BTW, I attempted to send this feedback via your app, but that feature doesn't seem to work at the moment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good but prices getting higher which makes me to find alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's a great app !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Spoiled all values after updating its menu features. Goodwill decreased due to asking update notes again and again whenever open it. It means now, it isn't available for free user any bit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fantastic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So they Allow only 25 notes.... useless now. Shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The original developer wrote a brilliant app. Sadly, over the years Evernote has been passed from one owner to another, none of whom have taken a long-term interest in the platform and have applied a random selection of whimsically insignificant 'upgrades' while ignoring - or maybe just unable to fix - some infuriating long-term bugs. All the time jacking up the annual subscription and/or moving well-used features to a higher subscription level."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do not recommend the Evernote system. I am sad for those who already use this system as now they are holding users hostage unless they pay $129 per year. Unless you are one of the very few who need some of the special features given, just pass. There are many viable free electronic notepads available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"For me it's a great place to store thoughts, data, information, ideas, etc... and have readily access to that information via various covenience portals. It's been a great tool for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using from 2013, and you guys were the best, that's why I always came back to use Evernote for anything. But now, after the implementation of the 50 free notes, you guys are now one of the worst app (if not THE worst note app to have around). I'm going to move all hundreds of my notes towards google docs instead. Looking forward to a better competition in note business, I'll definitely be using them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Expensive Anual Subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this was a 5 star app until they added a pay wall for multiple notebooks. I used this app for years so I had a ton of notebooks which should be standard and not behind a paywall. charging me money to basically make a new folder is ridiculous. greed ruining good things like usual. switched over to using clickup now. way more feature rich"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The thing is I fought tooth and nail from changing apps. I've been using this app for literally 20+ years. Now I'm being forced to buy a monthly subscription for $14.99 just to write a simple note. You guys have lost your way. I am taking my notes off this app and uninstalling it. You can't even use the free version. This app holds so many poems and that I've been able to write but now I can't."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So expensive!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free use ended."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of my essential apps. I've been using Evernote every day almost since it's infancy to collate all the plans and ideas that make up the different parts of my life. The app just gets better and better and for me is well worth the annual fee. I honestly could not do without it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"most annoying ads most annoying company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used Evernote for years -- it's super helpful, and keeps getting better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but damn near unusable at this point. Switched to Joplin, a free open-source alternative that backs up to Dropbox. automatically syncs across unlimited devices and is exactly what I need. works perfectly. I will never go back to Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect binder for all my lyrics and songs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really buggy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do not know what you guys at Evernote is doing...but imma need you guys to stop having pop us to join a paid membership..like many others I've had this app for a long time 2012 to be exact and I use this app to save passwords and notes for school or writing and recipes and my appointments etc .. now all of the sudden you guys want us to pay as if this is Amazon prime ..miss me with the B.S. I deleted madd old notes and still have ads popping up asking to join and pay for unlimitednotes/books"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried to start using the note taking again, finally working better after previous log in and data loss. New problem is the predatory and repeated bouts of splash screens blocking me from using the app and opening notes to add to or review and send. Constantly trying to go from a free app to an asininely high tier and cost for a low use app. App has potential, but is being oversold with a high price tag and ridiculous limitations as to the number of notes allowed in the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was amazing years ago, but they got greedy. After eleven years of use, I've deleted this app and am closing my account. Terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't know why this app shows that irritating premium pop up window when customer is happy with that standard version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good for keeping all notes, links etc in one place. Can organize by folder, but there is nothing special about the hierarchy m, nesting, or timeline of folders."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Multiple prompts daily to upgrade to a paid plan. Every time you open the app and at least once when you open an existing note, there is an annoying prompt. I'll be moving my notes to a different app. What a shame. Update 3/18/24: I have closed my account and deleted the app. I recommend Obsidian if you're on Android. It's so much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointed with the new subscription options. This used to be the absolute best notepad app available, hands down. I had 8 separate notebooks and probably 500 notes between them. Now I'm capped at one notebook and 50 notes unless I want to pay over a hundred dollars a year to use a notebook on my phone? Which is an insane price. I will go back to walking around with a physical notebook before I ever drop that much money for the convenience, absolutely not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new predatory monetization."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How about ""sort by"" title alphabetically A - Z as an option? Simple and easy. Please don't study. Just do. (REV March 18, 2024)So where is the ICON now? Hidden, deleted, or a paid option?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be able to cut & paste documents & photos from my laptop into app. Now, for the past 4-5 months, it won't allow me to do that. And trying to speak to a human to get some tech support is IMPOSSIBLE! I used to love Evernote because it allowed me to access documents that I've transferred into the app, on the go. Very frustrating. Have been researching other apps. will need to make a change."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very good 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love Evernote. Cannot live without it. It is my #1 used app on my phone and it isn't remotely close."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new version says it's installed but doesn't work and says install the new version, over and over. So I have no Evernote and will find a different App that works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too expensive at $5 per week."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The creation of notes on mobile app does not work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been an Evernote paid subscriber for about 15 years now. It used to be great, but their new versions on both Android and Windows are bloated, clunky, and full of bugs. The company cares more about making a flashy looking UI and adding features nobody asked for or wants than they do about fixing bugs and making a solid note taking app. There are serious bugs that have existed for at least 5-10 years that they just refuse to address. I'm definitely looking for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads and forcing you to upgrade. Had enough. Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of the best note taking app been using this app since high school"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"connect to internet issues"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"wont let me delete my account and erased all my notes from 2012. This is the kind of unreliable app it really is. useless and in breach of data ethics. update - now they wont let me delete my account by causing one hassle after another. its a nightmare to deal with this company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app! Only, lately I get a message saying I need to upgrade to the newest version but I don't get the option to do so on Google Play. What's this about? I want to keep using Evernote..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not yet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Started to suck since the most recently update. Just to access notes, have to take more steps. Also, layout is notbuser friendly now. Hope the previous lay9ut be restored asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is okay for taking notes and I've used it for a number of years. Recently started to a charge a ridiculous $130 per year to take notes... I'll be using something else from now on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"taaks and reminder can be more user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I keep getting an error message telling me to update the app by 23rd March 2024 or lose it , and directing me to Google play but when I go to Google play there is no option to update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bit the bullet and moved everything over to OneNote today. Goodbye endless Evernote ads, we're done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I never rate an app. But I'm here to give this one star because I'm frustrated with the annoyance that this one has given me. I unfortunately write some notes in it in the past few years because I liked it then. This is such a scammy app now. Constantly urging me to buy it. Started using keep notes. It fits my use case. Just manage my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I redownload it and signed in, but can't find any of my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for more than a decade, but since you no longer want to support Android 8 I will be forced to use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely atrocious monetization. App won't let you save more than 1 note before it paywalls you. Use literally anything else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice apk"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has become a pain to use this app over the last year, with so many pop-up to get you to buy subscription and not allowing you to create new notes. This used to be my go-to note keeping app. I am sad to leave and resort to other alternatives. It's not working for me anymore and just too much of unnecessary hassle to deal with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I took off a star for the reminder you get every time to sign up and pay, but other than that, it's always been great for what I used it for. Some of the reviews are over the top in their complaints about the reminder. It's annoying, but it's basically just a pop-up that you X out of and forget about until next time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not secure!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EDIT: the begging for me to pay never stopped. it actually increased to every single time I opened the app. deleted this app and never looked back. I really love this app. I've been using it for years, and until the last few weeks, I have zero complaints. with that being said, recently it's been popping an ad up for a paid version literally twice a day now. developer....please stop the begging and insanity, or it's back to the stock android pad, or whatever else I can find, for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was fine, but now I get a pop-up to subscribe nearly every time I open the app. It's so frustrating that I'm going to migrate over to a different note-taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I have to pay to make notes on my phone? No, thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be very good and had a free version that was really functional. Current version has aggressive monetization asking for $130 dollars a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying ads and pop-ups. Degrading functionality that makes it hardly usable without wanting to smash your phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to love it...now there is apparently no longer a free version as it won't let me add anything new without a subscription. If you want to charge for your app, do it! But don't pretend you have a free version when you don't. I only needed a basic note app and would pay for a simple version but don't need all the features here, especially at the crazy high prices they want to charge. (I mean $130?! Seriously?)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App has gotten greedy over the years. It's a great app but when I first started using it, I could have the free version on two devices and be able to access it via web from any device but now you can't even do that. Recently, they limited the # of notes bc even after deleting a bunch of notes, I'm still over the limit. I'd gladly pay for a subscription but I literally only take notes, no collaboration, etc and it's not worth the subscription. Going to switch to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"my files are gone....i use when app is free.. after some day i return to check my files..this application ask for money for access my file... without notice me...very bed..i hate Evernote..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Paid user sice 2012. Discover what's news popup that you need to kick away on every update is too annoying. How to make a note with a copy font, like simple notepads do? It should be both options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used to be free for just a few simple notes. I used it for smart selecting recipes online and creating individual notebooks for each recipe. I only have maybe a dozen or so. but now I can't do anything without paying even though it says I have up to 50 free notes within 1 notebook. $129 a year is way to much just for occasional uses for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had the free version for years, always seemed nice even though I didn't have access to the premium options. I have 484 notes with the free version but now they have changed it. You can only have 50 notes on the free version. So I cannot create any new notes and I would have to eliminate 435 notes just to create 1 new one. This is basically a defunct app on my phone now. The only reason to keep it is to have access to my old notes which will become less and less relevant as time passes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years, but this new version on my android tablet is a total piece of garbage. It crashes. It's impossible to navigate, and it looks super remedial. And I'm paying $130 a year to get screwed over like this? Roll back to an older version or fix all the garbage with this one, or I'm out of here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote became part of the GREEDY bunch. Time to switch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a user from 2012, and suddenly, I could not create any note, popup everywhere, and every tap show the warning. I deleted my account and have to give 1 star to this app. Hope you long live with your remaining loyalty users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"RANSOM-WARE! I have used the free version of the app for more than 10 years, and my notebooks contain >200 notes. Suddenly, the company discontinued the free version of the app and began charging $129/yr. I can't add any more notes, and each time I try to access my existing notes, I must wade through a gauntlet of screens telling me me I have to pay $129 to continue using the app. The problem is compounded by the fact that there is no simple method to export my existing notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very user friendly. But now I'm asked to pay!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too expensive to get all the best features. I would take some lower screen ads for a free full fledge version. It could be perfect for me but for personal use, I can't justify the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps deleting my entire note if I switch apps and put my phone to sleep. Sometimes deleting hours of writing. How is autosave not a core function of a writing app?! Edit 03/2024: They're now intentionally making it unusable. Messed up home page, note limit, auto-refresh, and ads every time you navigate to a new page... Changed to Google Docs for free. It's not awesome, but it's way better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cumbersome clunky tagging system since being bought out. I ceased my premium membership due to this. Tagging a clip has no obvious option to save the tags you add. Do I need to do one at a time and click back and forth between those screens? In the end they weren't even saved. Next to useless and barely consumer grade now.... 2024 update... fark this I'm out..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is completely useless now unless you upgrade!! You can only have 50 notes on free version, and after having this app for almost 10yrs I hit that limit a long time ago and haven't been able to create new notes since December. Literally no point in keeping evernote now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am unable to use the free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Works fine, but it's too expensive. 🥴"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was recommended to me years ago, its been a constant in my life ever since. I don't think its been thought through that there's an endless quanity of apps for taking notes. We didn't all choose this one because it's the best notes app (which it is), but because it's the best FREE notes app. Now you have to pay for it. I mean you're opening an app, jotting something down, closing the app... the people who care enough to pay aren't the ones who utilize this app. We hoard. For free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go-to app for note-taking since 2017, and I thought it was fantastic. However, their constant nagging to upgrade to premium every time I opened the app became incredibly annoying. Now, I can't even create new notes without being bombarded with prompts to buy premium. It's like they're holding my notes hostage until I cough up the cash. Way to ruin a good thing, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly... The app on laptop updated and told me that I can't create things notes or notebooks till I pay them. I can't believe are going this low down and dirty to get money. I hope your proud. I hope the dirty money worth it. Now I understand why I can't make notebooks on my phone. I'm absolutely disgusted by y'all. AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO LIFETIME PAYMENT OPTION!!!!!!! Such a kick in the face y'all really don't care about people at all anymore. Y'all just want money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I relied heavily on this for all my notes, I had it for 6 years... now they just want to charge you for everything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app now seemingly takes a screenshot everytime you open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Automatic log out while typing a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I love how I can access my notes just about anywhere either on my pc or on my phone. Edit: due to the incessant nagging to upgrade (including a ""one time offer I can never return to"" multiple times a week), I decided to bite the bullet and move to another service. It was good while it lasted, but not anymore. Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"great app with less attention to customer's voice and needs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's just a giant ad for the premium subscription. It borderline unusable with how often they force you to decline the premium subscription service. There are way too many free notes apps that do it better and aren't aggressively annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very easy to use because it not take a lot of things to see. Just, very comfortable to use it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ah yes, now it's time to threaten to remove support for the old desktop version of the program where it doesn't change the font on you every time you hit return (among other quality of life removal decisions). Evernote continues to make it very, very clear how little they respect the userbase's wants and needs from the product while charging out the nose to store a bunch of text files. I thought I'd found exactly what I needed, but the product goes further downhill every year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The functionality of the app is now better than ever. I've reinstated my 5 star review."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for over a decade now; they have filled it with so many ads and desperate attempts to bait you into paying for their useless premium subscription, that it's no longer functional. I can't even write a new note because I get locked into the ""are you SURE you don't want to pay us $130 a year for no reason?"" page. How am I supposed to remember my jokes? How will I ever become a stand-up comedian?! Oh yeah, I'll use literally any other note taking service besides Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"For a simple note taking application... It does it's work pretty well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They stopped the old legacy app to Sync. I have been with Evernote for last 10 years and have to leave it for Zoho and MS note. It is unfair to stop maintenance of old legacy software. Very unfair to treat your loyal clients this way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update March 2024: STAY AWAY! Crazy amounts of removing functionality and putting it behind pay walls. 1 star. Update April 2021: Removed another star. Changing the interface and forcing people to pay to pay to modify it at all? Super scummy. I know you have to make your money but this product keeps getting worse, with more and more behind a paywall. Original: Super easy to use! Recent change where you have to pay to have your account on more than two devices when in the past it was included."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop asking me to upgrade every single time I open the app! It's more of a hassle just getting to my actual note to review it! I'm thinking I need to find a different app 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's very easy and convenient"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All my notes was deleted by the new update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant barrage of ads pushing to get the paid version of the app have probably had the opposite affect of what they hoped. Not only would I never subscribe, I'm slowly moving my stuff off and to another app that hasn't become so annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"nogood"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent App in all respects."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop pushing your upgrades multiple times after opening the app. The app is terrible annoying and skipping the upgrade is well hidden intentionally."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Might as well uninstall and search for something more usable. This app has become a continuous headache that accomplishes nothing at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is HORRIBLE. In their attempt to encourage subscriptions they've nearly become unusable. Difficult to even access existing notes. At this point, I just want my existing notes exported out and delete this NIGHTMARE of an app! Seriously, what they've done ought to be illegal and punishable by capital punishment. Pathetic."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app hasn't been opening for days. It requires me to sign in each time, but entering my email or signing in with Google doesn't work. I need help as I have important notes stored in the app that I can't access. Please assist in resolving this sign-in issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using the paid version of the app for years. It is very slow. Widget stopped working a few months ago. VERY difficult to edit notes if any kind of a table is involved. Only way to do it is on PC. I wish I wasn't trapped in with all note notes I've made because the app seems to get worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They make cancelling a PIA. Been trying to cancel for an hour."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It has stop working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier the premium subscription was affordable. Now it is overpriced. I am thinking about switching to alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become an unmitigated disaster"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"unpleasantly surprised to see the cost per week🤔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Отвратительное приложение, невероятно как можно сделать простой блокнот и при этом быть таким жадным будто сделали Microsoft Word. Приложение медленное, много лишней анимации, цена космос, функционал низкий, организация заметок неудобная и тд."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App can not be updated"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop paywall creep!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No free trial without comprises to credit card."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic service, trying to leech money off of their users wherever possible, can't even give a breathable experience without stuffing microtransactions everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Searching for better one now... Too much pop up for opting premium version... That's very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"לא תומך ב RTL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From Evernote to Nevernote. 50 notes only? Hahaha what a scam! Easiest decision ever. Bye! Why is this still rated at 3.2? It should be 1. Not going to update since every single update cuts features. Edit: be aware of clearly paid 5 stars reviews. Tells you everything you need to know about this service... sorry I mean app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Usally questions give me money, normaly ı liked but last 3 mounths evrday a lot of time want to money. It's horrible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ad spam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been locked out of everything. Swiping down to add a few notes will be missed along with webclipper, my data, thoughts, and memories Evernote erased since 2014? I'm visually impaired now and this app was my occupational therapy. Older version were better because I COULD SEE the black elephant on the green background. ~15 notebooks, 5000+thoughts are being held hostage for $130/yr with bugs. You need a DOWNLOAD/html Export feature so we can leave with our memories for FREE. Zero/5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love this app. Great service and support. No ads and plenty of memory for storage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I uninstall this app due to not supporting farsi ( persian) language"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I miss when this app was free and wasn't forcing me into a membership. What happened to having 100 notebooks? Now I have to upgrade to begin a new one even though I'm only at 74. Search also doesn't work as well as it used to. I have to search the same term 2-3 times for it to finally show accurate results."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So disappointed. After updated, it takes tones of time to load my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HUGE price increase. I've been a paying subscriber of this app for years, and now my $70 annual fee is being raised to $120?? You've got to be kidding me. I use this for my small business and a $50 price hike just won't cut it. Time to start researching other apps now. What a let down and a disservice to long time existing customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for 10+ years now. Multiple phone worth of time. Getting rid of this app today after the excessive amount of pop up subscription windows. You already havest our note information for data to sell to advertising agencies. Stop trying to take our money too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"THERE IS NO ONE MANNING THIS ACCOUNT.Enjoyed free acct since 2003. Feeling defeated, I now feel it's easier to give in & purchase yearly personal plan (rather than pay monthly). Though ALWAYS BOMBARDED with TONS of Evernote pop-ups begging me to upgrade, I'm now unsuccessfully digging all over & unable to find how to pay for annual subscription. It's SO EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING that it now seems worthwhile to find a different note-taking app & transfer everything over before my next payment is due."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paying a monthly subscription just to type some notes? Figure out another way to make money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's become more of a hassle than anything over the past year. There's always a prompt trying to get you to upgrade. Anytime you try to make a note or read a note there's a prompt. It takes more effort to get the prompts off your screen then it does to accomplish anything else. This app has turned into a major waste of my time and patience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It forced to make annual subscription otherwise I can't access my notes. Afterward, the quality was declining, and bugs kept coming. I had to clear caches every now and then. I even can't save my web articles. What a stupid purchase"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"at first useful, the app has become unusable because it keeps pressuring me into buying the pro version, like 5 times in a row. I have switched to Google Keep, which has the subset of features I care about."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps closing on its own as soon as u try to type anything. Unusable app since many months. Hiked price 3 folds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I dont know. Never got to open it. Too slow to do anything with. Not good when you're trying to write songs. Especia!!ynot the way I do it. By the time its open, everythings already gone. Its not my equipment either I dont think cos it works fine with other apps. Cant guarantee that tho."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Starting to charge for an already poorly ran and performing app was all it took for me to seek a different service. Used this thing for years, but it was clear there were way better options out there, especially now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good n superb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This has been a fantastic app I've enjoyed for personal use for free for over 10 years. But now, I am getting inundated with pop up screens and notices to upgrade everytime I use the app. It's borderline harassment. Fine Evernote, if you only want paying users then go that route and give free users like me a timeframe for going paid and we'll arrange to export our data and uninstall your app. But stop the constant upgrade poking. Geezus, it's annoying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"app itself is great, too bad its creator has resorted to have the app FREQUENTLY pester me to upgrade to a paid plan that I absolutely don't need. will still use though"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They changed the policy so we have less storage limit. Premium plans are fairly expensive, considering the competitors."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"& The New Rating because you're shutting down the good old version.. 😞 I'm sorry but, I just can't get used to the new one. With grieving heart, I must move on to another app.. The times were great, while it lasted.. 😌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My paid subscription has expired, and I choose not to extend my subscription. I want to sync between all my devices, my android device included. But it's painfully slow to type when using evernote on android. Now I want to go back to the free version but it won't let me sync (even though I have 2 syncs left to use). The paid subscription really isn't worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry for you that this organization chose to basically eliminate options for those of us who helped you get to where you are, even the free version. A 10+ year customer who is migrating elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The most ads for their priced plans I've seen from any app. Won't be using it anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be such a great app. Have used it for years. But now it is constantly trying to get you to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"(1) Please stop asking/forcing to buy premium. (2) Fix auto auto-rotate setting in the app. (3) UI needs to be updated to material UI."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increíble how annoying this subsection promotion became, I can't damn do any steps with my free plan now. So sad to completely leave this app behind even after using it for such simple functionality that didn't even require any plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Hi i just bought your premium plan yearly. And i found the apps often closed by it self . Evernote please respond to it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"جميل جدا"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"superb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"That was very helpfull"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app is visually amazing. Other apps have coolest functions but this app is convenient and provides a dashboard like no other. Pricing is the only issue I have with it. It bit pricey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant popups promoting paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Your app is fantastic, but what about the users who have ""right-to-left"" text formatting in their language? In addition, the app is slow in opening a blank note. Thank you for your attention to these matters."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Back to issues with password protection I see. The app is once again not asking for the code I set to open it. Very disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"worth it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many in app adds wanting you to upgrade to expensive options that many other apps offer for free. I've had an account since 2014 and finally deactivating due to how frequent and aggressive the adds are"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to say that with this mandatory update, all my notes went away and their ridiculous services did not address this situation is truly regrettable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Its nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be great and now they limit it so much it is almost useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Please go back to original format. Way to difficult now. I love this app and us it weekly, but find it difficult to use since update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new 50 note limit makes this unusable for me. It's not worth it for me me to upgrade for more space"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It is good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One star for the crazy ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime you open irritating pop up to sign up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How to ruin an app, by Evernote. The NEED for money as if this app was the best or the only one on the planet??? Too restrictive with the free plan and way too expensive. No previous warning that these restrictions would come into place. Been using the app for about a decade and it will be cheaper to leave it than pay for a RIDICULOUS plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Superb 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app before they increase their prices dramatically. 12 years user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gatekeeping notes with 'premium'? Nah, goodbye Evernote. You offer is backlashing you and you could've had another premium feature ASIDE FROM limiting the amount of notes to avoid this. I'm moving all my notes to another online journal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Kinda sad to switch to another note app because of limited note use and need to upgrade to premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it, but the constant upgrade spam is annoying and distracting. I considered upgrading, but the price is too high."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My account was accessed by someone in India. I've never been there. Avoid this app, it will leak your data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're scammers: They doubled the subscription price a while back, but it's difficult to find an efficient way to just export all my old files. I've been too busy to go through all of my past notes to copy and paste them. I'm finally able to cancel now because I have the time, but I realized looking back that I've been paying them twice the price while using it 99% less (if at all)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Functions pretty well. If you don't pay to upgrade it though, every time you go to any note you've taken you'll have have to go through a series of prompts asking you to give them money. (You'll spend as much time in those promts as you will in your notes). It's almost as pathetic as it is annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"price keeps going up; sync is slower and less reliable; was great, but it's degraded too much to recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good for notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: I used to love this app, but it has recently become too business faced, restricting regular non-paying users to even take notes and organize them outside of a very tight limit. Evernote has many amazing features and functions that are worth money, but simply having more than 50 notes and being able to organize them is something that should be available to all people for free. This update has caused me to leave Evernote after 7 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscriptions will kill this app, not keep it alive. Like many other users, I have been using Evernote for over a decade. However, I can no longer create new notes because I have so many that I am now required to sign up for a paid subscription plan. I will be migrating my recipes, poetry snippets, and other notes over to Google Notes since that doesn't require payment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the service now requires a membership that is overpriced,. the free version is too limited to only one folder and 50 notes which is ridiculous. I recommend OneNote and will be switching very soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I, like many I see in other reviews, was a loyal user for years. I always recommended Evernote. Had it on every smartphone I remember owning since middle school (back in 2013ish?). It was simple, efficient, full of tools! Not anymore. Now, it has become a glitchy state of ""upgrade to premium"" propaganda, just like everything else is these days. You can't make two clicks without being bombarded by a pop-up ad for their premium services. I will not support it, and plan to go back to pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited notes: 50 notes for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"buy-a-plan nagware, capped my max notes after years of unlimited notes, you've heard it all before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their new business strategy is, ""We will annoy you until you cannot stand it anymore and finally buy the subscription for $100 a year."" I just moved my 600 notes to Notion after 6 years of happily using Evernote. Good luck with the 50 free notes limit! 🤑"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become so bad. Purchase adds at every step. Keeps freezing to update the text (which has already lost me a few paragraphs of notes). I've also reached the maximum number of notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has been ignoring system-wide portrait lock for almost 3 years and the devs are intent on ignoring the problem even after multiple threads in their support forums dating back to 2022 complaining of the problem. Do not give this company your money. They do not care."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"its horrible. slow. restarts. search doesn't work anymore. more expense than Dinsey+"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lol I get that they needed to monetize their app but a limit to 50 notes for ""free plan"" and $130 a year? It's useful and full of features but I mean.. it's not $11 a month good.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't activate this app without purchasing an upgraded version....very disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Soooo, I can't create any new notes because I have 29 which in Evernote world is greater than 50. Nice one. My advice, use a note app that can count... I will."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Salam wakahat"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app recently is asking for the upgrade and won't open. There is no way to get rid of the upgrade pops out, and currently, the app is locked out. Annoying and out of use now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to login now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is now charging to do new notes past the 50 notes mark. This is not cool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"exceptional app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"All I use this app for is a sharable checklist that 2 people can access. The paid version of the app is extremely overpriced, especially for what I use the app for, so I use the free version. Every single time that I open Evernote, I get a popup ad nagging me to upgrade to the paid version. After declining this every day for months, this app is now excruciatingly slow, and I think it's because we're on the free version. I'm annoyed, and I'm switching to Google Docs for their checklist feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Amazing experience using this app for about 6 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a terrible app this has become! Everytime I open up the app I get 3 different pop-ups trying to ""persuade"" me to buy the premium version. Misleading exit options from these pop-ups finally get me to the notes themselves. Trying to make a new note? Forget about it! I was informed that I couldn't make new notes without the premium version so I deleted many old notes. This did nothing and I learned that no matter how many notes I deleted I would need to buy the premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"like the notery but need some money for storage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I would give 5 stars if it stopped crashing in my Galaxy Fold 4 full screen mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of times it asks me to upgrade is frustrating. I remember when this app was free! Now they're just greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Needs android 7 update. Forcing me get new phone when I don't need one. Environmentally unfriendly therefore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately it's Unusable from long time ago!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like it, using it more than 5y"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used Evernote for years. I am currently a paid subscriber. Just switched to a new phone and can't log in to my account. The Continue button doesn't work on the first screen. Please fix asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm finally giving up. I desperately needed access to a particular PDF that I saved to Evernote. As is its custom of late, it just spun and spun. I need reliable, quick access to some of my notes. If I can't guarantee that, then this app is useless to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Am highly disappointed for not functioning"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work. Sad, this used to be my go to app, some time ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can you fix the sharing directly from browser, it says loading n then clipping failed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"salvou muito"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's unusable due to constant crashes on tablet. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So bad , only paid service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app really lags. Like REALLY BAD"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"good app but keeps trying to get you to upgrade to the paid version - really annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't want or use, takes up space."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"ограниченный функционал в бесплатной версии: после ограничения количества создаваемых заметок, всё использование сводится к просмотру рекламы платной версии..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So now you want to charge me more than Netflix to access my 3000 notes I've saved to this app over the years? You are holding my data for ransom as there is no easy way to download my notes. I think these bait and switch tactics should be illegal. Uninstalling as soon as I copy my critical information. Update: Google Keep notes is doing a good job as a replacement. I have deleted my account. Sorry I can't rate zero stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to be a nice app but from some time it starts annoying with too many upgrade ads untill now when it stops me from making new notes if I'm don't pay lol now I need to copy all my notes to other app... Ridiculous!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New policy makes existing users out of compliance, ruining what was already a very flawed system. If you can find another note taking solution, definitely do so before choosing Evernote, as you will hit a very small threshold and be forced to upgrade and pay. Couldn't be more annoyed with these people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App is telling me to update (as itll stop working on march 23) but there is NO OPTION to update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works like a charm. Reasonably fast, the best way of clipping articles. Notes, anything kept very well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why app not working?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have decided to part ways with Evernote as I have found an alternative free application that meets my needs. I am not inclined to pay for the services of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To subscribe for paid version is just impossible. I have tried every advice but nothing seems to work. Both on google play and on the website. So frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became overloaded with unnecessary features and payment plans offerings. I'm going to migrate my data away to forget about app that once was pretty useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is me updating the review after using this app for more than a decade from 5 stars to 1. Stop showing pop-ups for a deal, and it's not a deal if it's omnipresent. I just wanted to make a quick note before I forget it, not try to find that tiny x button or that carefully designed 'not now button' that is impossible to find. what kind of AGGRESIVE MARKETING IS THIS????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unnecessarily expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I don't usually leave reviews but I had to with this one. I've had this app for years and never had a problem. Yes, the ads got annoying, but I'm not against ads, largely. But today I go to make a note and it tells me I've reached my limit. Fine. I delete more than half my notes (it was a long time coming anyway) and STILL it won't let me make new notes. If I had known that, I would've just kept the old notes and edited them as I needed to. You can't beat pen and paper, in the end, anyway"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is a foolish app and a scam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Frequent crashes/blank screen when loading a note. It has most of what I'm looking for but it's laggy and crashes or will reload a page frequently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is spiraling downward, and everything they do to stanch the bleeding only makes it worse. They don't seem to understand that when free, and by now better, alternatives exist, not many people are going to pay for an unstable and error prone service using a slow and bug-ridden app with a terrible and jumbled UI, or that constantly hounding users for money only drives them away. It's not a unique service anymore, EN don't get this, and they offer no compelling reasons for users to stay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app been using for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it from the beginning and it has been whittled down to useless. So sad to see such a previously powerful app become such a waste. Don't waste your money on this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is a bait & switch money grab scam now. Used to be a good app but even the paid version doesn't work anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keeps resetting"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since the ""upgrade"", the app freezes when I'm trying to get into a folder. Sometimes there's just a long lag time and others it just freezes completely. I am not a fan of the ""improvements"". 😕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"restricted all my old notes on upgrade and want more money. crooks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"upgrade this, upgrade that. jeez, i'll upgrade when i need to but i'm okay with what i have right now you know? the app always been bloated but now it's even worse with the constant ad popping up everytime it opened. Had been using the app for 7 years but i guess it's time to move on to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is trash now. Takeover Pop-Up advertisement after every single action taken everywhere in the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Busted Apps.. Rubbish!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Handwriting aka Sketching is completely (!!) unusable. Unless you only want every other stroke to be actually written. Didn't test other features since this is a must-have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like this app, especially for the ability to organize notes into notebooks and the scratchpad.....but then google started going for my throat with the OBNOXIOUS upselling attempts where clicking ""no"" wasn't even enough - now you have to click ""no,"" then you have to CONFIRM that you really meant ""NO I DON'T WANT TO SPEND MONEY FOR AN APP TO JUST JOT DOWN A NOTE OR TWO."" I've uninstalled this and had to find something else to use. A true shame, I used to use Evernote all the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"limiting notes behind paywalls now? not nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good for note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote hasn't been perfect for years but it has certainly improved, I've looked for others but always come back to it. However the incessant advertising has pushed me over the edge and I've just deleted my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Keeps crashing often. Think I have to leave."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful experience on Galaxy Tab Ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a goto app for years but Cannot use on my lgv30 phone after update. Notes and notebooks show up on the list. But will not open for editing or viewing even after purchasing upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the heck?!?!?!?!?!? I keep getting an ""update"" warning. When I click on update in Google play, there are NO UP DATES! I just paid for this app! What games are you people playing????????? Ugh!🙄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Incredibly hard to use because i keep getting prompted to do things like review it or upgrade when i just want to add something to a shopping list. looking forward to migrating away when I have time. in stage 2 or 3 of enshitification."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Greatest"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was good for a time. After the changes in monetisation it became not worth it. I'm not paying weekly for a notepad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The pushing of paid plans is obnoxious. You have to decline 2-3 separate screens just to get at a note. I will be porting over my existing notes to another app soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DON'T UPDATE! 50 Note Limit Without warning, you will be limited to 50 notes. Bait and switch tactic to get you hooked and then try to sell you an expensive subscription to continue. I'll be transferring to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You're cant open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywalling old and free options is a nice way to lose users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has turned into a pesky app of late with every single touch promoting me to purchase the premium version. The other big issue is performance. I have never seen such a slow app so far."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing but now it constantly keeps trying to force me to purchase their plan. I wish they didn't become so greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"La version gratuita esta muy limitada y por ese precio se pieden encontrar mejores opciones"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is crashing and is not maintained!! Help; have years of worldwide notes in a crashing app!!! Keeps crashing in my Samsung- lowering to 1 star"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"once upon a time, it was a very useful free tool. now, as with most apps these days, it's all about the Benjamin. I'm looking elsewhere these days for a useful notepad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be bloated but excellent. Now it's absolutely horrible with their pop-ups and terrible pricing structure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always needs a updated but I cant"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ten at 10 I love it ❤️💜❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: I opened evernote to jot down something from memory.. but as always, a popup EVERY time I open the app asking if I want to pay. This time a new popup asking me to use the trial or pay with no way to close it and by the time I finished reading and force closed the app, I forgot the numbers I was trying to remember. Thanks evernote. Uninstalled and finally moved it all to onenote. Great idea, HORRIBLE experience for free users. btw, I have to reinstall the PC app every time I restart my PC"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved to use this app for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It now wants to charge people for money using the app that is just to keep my notes in check... I'll probably go for Google keep or one note...

Why do I have to buy a new phone just to be able to access my notes? 3)The $100 fee for a year’s subscription is too expensive especially when there are other competitors out there offering similar services for free. I think my Evernote days will soon be over…"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but lately there are so many ads for a subscription that it is really frustrating to use. It is hard to get past the ads so I can actually access my notes. I am looking for something different."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm rating this app again because the older version was way better, The application now is not usable with so many pushy advertisements and very limited space and impractical interface so what could be worse!?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks I trusted it..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has become a sucky company with an inability to solve problems. I've been engaged with them since 2012. Bots serve in reducing workforce, but there are times this is NOT helpful to subscribers, especially with account management. The free version is limited but adequate for most but their process stops when you need additional help. Even when you pay for an account, no additional help can be found. From reading it was recently (1/2023) acquired by a new company. Has something gone?"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Finally, tagging of notes have been fixed. No need to erase the typed characters once a tag has been selected!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never seen an app can be so annoying. Every single click leads to a pop up window ask if I want to upgrade, makes it so hard to use, if you really want money like that, you should ask the users to buy BEFORE they can download."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nearly suffocating, near constant request pop-ups to join premium. They've rendered it very, very difficult to use. Feels like I'm spending more time batting away pop-ups than using the app for its intended purpose. I've been using this app for 10 years stubbornly, I suppose, at this point, and it's worth me moving on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you guys asking me every time, I open the to take subscription? I don't want to take the subscription. It's annoying how many times you mf asks. I would ask everyone jump to NOTION. It's the best, way better than evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for so many years i lost counting, it was the best. Now thank you for ruining the ux .. Horrible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's frustrating when misuse or overuse of AI impacts application storage. It's important for developers to optimize AI usage to avoid unnecessary strain on storage resources."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want to have to close five ""ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY 80QUID A YEAR?"" windows every time I open this app. It's now losing my notes, I've lost one that is incredibly important and now is empty and in the trash. I've been considering uninstalling this app for a long time and now that's just convinced me. No back up, no security, too many ""are you sure you don't want to pay us??"" for a note app I just want to be freaking simple!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant spamming of paid plans. Removing more features without subscription."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used evernote for years without note count limitations. Today I found out I no longer can create more than 50 notes. I had thousands of notes. But now I cannot create any new notes unless I pay $130 a year. Good bye Evernote. Time for me to find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"If you plan on using the free version, don't bother downloading. They start making it very difficult to use the free version. I actually lost a bunch of personal, important information. It's good if you're willing to pay the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"В последнее время этот сервис просто огорчает. За долгие годы создал себе пару сотен заметок, разделил по блокнотам, а теперь ограничение 50 заметок и один блокнот. 15 евро в месяц для обычного блокнота это чересчур. Постоянные всплывающие окна с предупреждениями ""ТОЧНО ОТКАЗАТЬСЯ"" просто раздражают. В последнее время заметки совсем перестали сохраняться (видимо так хотят перевести на платную подписку). Написал абзац текста и потерял его. Придётся перейти в сервис, где не нужно платить за воздух"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"LOVE THIS APP!!! It is a total must-have for any organizer or someone who wants to be more organized."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024 update: having used for 4+years they now want £100+ a year. F-off. It's unusable unless you pay.Now need to find a way to export all my notes and import into something that isn't a scam. The free tier constantly bombards you with popovers asking for payment, and my desktop version won't work at all now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm very disappointed that so nice tool blocked all free options, probably you will lose all your clients by such unfair move 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is no free version as such left with this app, they are constantly bringing new restrictions to sell their upgrades. I had been a premium customer, however now don't like their cheap tactics. Better go for one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This application has become totally unusable write at this moment. if there WERE possibility, this app should get no star for his cruel money making policy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was good until someone decided to auto rotate the app and to push the plan update add EVERY SINGLE TIME!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much nagging for premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version no longer supports even basic needs. Even if you delete notes, you will get constant ""over 50 note limit"" errors. Evernote will be dead soon enough; save yourself the trouble and look for a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sad now they want so much money for people to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app ever, you simply can't create offline notes even if you select offline in options, moreover i can't open some my notes one month already even with internet connection, it continuesly show loading ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too pushy about their paid subscriptions, which are way too expensive themselves. $130/year for online notepad? Absolutely screw off with that"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed ruins all things. I am not paying you $150 a year to store maybe 6MB of note data. I've used this app for over a decade, but greed has finally won out over common sense. I'll be downloading my data, deleting this app, and installing something else with a simpler interface. Goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't make the mistake of thinking you can use the free version of the app comfortably anymore. It used to be a decent option, but now they aggressively harass users to upgrade daily with huge popups as soon as your trial is over, and the free app is way more limited than it used to be. Charging money is fine of course, but it feels like a bait and switch now that millions of people have years' worth of notes and it's a pain to transfer to other apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is no longer fluid and you are spammed to buy the paid plan (usually, a 2-3 steps spam. It is not just a pop up to close )"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been an evernote user since 2012. Never had a problem. The app always worked great. But for the last year they spam me every time I open the app to get me to upgrade. Now they won't let me make a new note unless I upgrade. No thanks. I'm dumping ""never note"". I'll be migrating to ""notion"" for my future note needs. Sayonara."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"a great note taking app, I've been using it for years, however I'm tired of the ads. every single time you open the app, it tries to offer you premium plans. sometimes multiple ads pop up before I can even get into a note to read it. it's disrespectful to ask $169.99-$200+ a year for a note taking app. good luck Evernote it's been fun"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app (free version) for well over two decades now and lately the annoying pop ups trying to get me to pay for the upgrades version are annoying. EVERY time I go into the app it asks me, I got the X out say No and then I get an""Are you SURE???"" Pop up close that and get ANOTHER message asking if I'm sure I don't want to try. I said no so bothering me. I'd rather get in app banner ads then get prompted every time. I'm switching to Microsoft OneNote or doesn't pressure me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incompatible with Galaxy Fold5 Phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fantastic app. Now they've made changes to where you can only have a certain amount of notes or you need to upgrade, and I've been trying to consolidate and delete ones I no longer need, but I still can't make new notes. And the subscription pop-ups are kind of excessive. $15 for a note app subscription is wild pricing; I would have considered it for $1 or $2 a month, or $15 for a year. I like this app, but if I can't use it, I'll be switching to a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very very usefull,no need paper at meeting,and no need notebook again in EDC bag."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was amazing years ago now it has gone downhill fast. You need to pay to use it. It is so slow I would not pay for it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very aggressive adverts, pops up everytime the app opens to check notes. Stop shoving ads in my face. I will stick to the phone's free and easy to use note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash. Horrible. Deplorable. Crimen. Felony. I'm so fed up updated a note, click to save the changes and look again in a few minutes and ¡Oooh surprise, everything has AGAIN BEEN DELETED! Well, I will use Word as app to keep my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been a game-changer for me in terms of organization and productivity. Its seamless integration across devices ensures that my notes are always accessable , whether I'm on my computer, phone, or tablet. The ability to create notebooks and tags has revolutionized the way I manage my thoughts and tasks, allowing for easy categorization!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was good while it last, but now it's saying I need a +9 version, which apparently is not available to my phone, cause there's no updates available, so no modern phone no evernote. Farewell, I will seek another."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am unable to login in my account or wven update the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very handy but their constant harassing for upgrades is a nuisance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Old version was far better, new version is atrociously glitchy & constantly freezes, rebooting half a dozen times in a row, deleting notes that aren't saved midway through. It will freeze & you'll try to save, but it won't let you. Only option is closing task & then all your work is gone. Use a different app. This one is no longer viable. You guys used to have a winner, but you evidently broke it & continue to find ways to break it further. To add insult to injury, now it costs more $$$ too!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent app changes are NOT for the better. On a different note, how the heck does a password expire 5 days after it has been changed? I have had to reset my password more times in the last 2 weeks than is conscionable. Evidently the bent spoon has broken. Paid subscriber for 13 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Was good but now it pushes upgrade too incessantly. Used to be 1gb free and moved it down to 60mb."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote has become my filing cabinet. I was initially unhappy about the price increase, but they definitely have made some great improvements to its functionality and speed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years for free with the free limitations. Suddenly to continue using the same app the same way on the same device, I have to pay $130/year or you'll hold my previously made notes hostage?! Terrible!!! I'll be replacing this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"အားလုံးအတွက်"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fir Se Plan Lo 🥺"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Looking hood,trying my best so far,hope I'm attaching what I should."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Astazi aplicatia asta a devenit a un gunoi inutil. Am tolerat interdictia de a mai crea note noi si popurile enervante cu oferte, dar e bataie de joc sa-mi spuna ca nu mai pot folosi aplicatia pt ca sint logat pe 2 dispozitive, cind unul dintre cele 2 e cel pe care il tin in mina. Si bineinteles ca nu-mi arata dispozitivele pe care sint logat pentru a le gestiona. sint sigur ca ma voi descurca mai bine cu one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the update, I lost all the information that I had for 6 years. What shall I do?????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Premium subscriber. Update: it's improved. Noticeable difference. Each update makes me nervous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Google search ""what happened to Evernote"" and this will tell you everything you need to know. Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sejak berbayar malah tidak responsif aplikasinya"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible, dont waste your time on it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote Ever The Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very crashy, very buggy, very restrictive in terms of number of notes you can create. Too much of selling to buy paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only have 35 notes... App constantly nags me saying I've reached the 50 note limit and demands $129 to continue. Use to be a good app. Not so much anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I use the Evernote free version. Good to store passwords and contact info. I used it almost every day. Recently my phone was stolen and I got a new phone. I can't seem to access the tasks and notes I had stored on my old phone and customer service seems to be down. I can't find any help in the help and learning section or a phone number or email to contact Evernote. Can someone from Evernote help me to restore my old notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I keep getting an error message that I can't add any more notes for free as only 50 are allowed. I only have 15. When trying to reach your customer service via e-mail, I was re-directed down a path with no options to reach out to anyone on this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is an adware right now. Don't download it. If was a beautiful app before. They updated recently, not it has adds, popups forcing you to pay money.. I changed my review from 5 stars to 1 . I deserves a zero star rating right now. I recomend everyone using Nimubus. Is a very clean apo with no adds. Im not 100 happy with that app but is so much better that using the latest crappiest update from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my favorite note-taking app before. I have been using this since 2013 but due to the recent annoying update, prompts for upgrade, and limits, I had to export and delete my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I just updated my app from 10.50.4. Previous versions after 10.50.4 no longer worked when clipping on sites. Everything works well now. Will give 5 stars if I can create tags when clipping."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I want to update app how to do this please help me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Advice for you: You should fire who made all this mess before turning a Top notch app to just Garbage!, the mess that will make you lose most of all your Customers/Users who used this app for a long time, and will turn all new users to other alternatives far from you, too! You are walking a downhill road in your decision making policy as it is Now, you should fix these idiotic ideas that will make you suffer more, which focus on the short-term rapid gains and already neglected the big picture!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was an early supporter of evernote, but not anymore. They keep charging more and more for fewer features, and the customer support is abysmal. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is Flickering and rebooting. Don't know what they did with this last version but it keeps rebooting. Hopefully they come out with the update that fixes this major glitch. Plus the in add apps are super annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As stated by others, I have used this app for years, and now they have decided to black mail people to create a paid version. No thanks, I've uninstalled it .. Found one for free that blows this away. Color Notes, I love it.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Always a very useful app. Unfortunately the version on my old but faithful Samsung Tab S2 will now be withdrawn, forcing me to invest in a new tablet. I am definitely not a happy bunny."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"hate evernote ever since they put the limit on the number of notes and notebooks, practically destroying the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"trash, dont use, will forget your notes and has a note limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now for everything it asks for subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has become unusable lately, with too many popups, the editor feels buggy, and UI as a whole is horrendous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Saya sudah menggunakan aplikasi ini cukup lama. Aplikasi yang bagus untuk menyimpan catatan namun berubah setelah mulai berbayar dan membatasi pembuatan notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10 years.... 10 fing years I've had this app. Now you want 130 dollars a year from me? Are you crazy? And you say the free limit is 50 notes? I have 26. And can't create anything without you trying to get me to fork over money. It's pathetic how this world has changed.... 130 dollars for what is essentially a note pad 😄😄✌️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is the app you need ! To organise your notes ! To quickly find the note you are looking for 👍👍👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rarely rate apps. This one is a rip-off. They want to charge you for everything they can and halt productivity with ridiculous amounts of requests to upgrade. Use Google docs/drive!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ist beautiful application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good app functionality but has recently become almost unusable due to pop ups. These are trying to get you to get subscriptions or special offers and so on, highly irritating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moving notes to a better note app. I was a fan for many years up until it supposedly changed hands."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have a problem the stolen hacked my IP my Google willet everything is locked i hop this ap helping me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This a very fully-fledged notes app. It probably has whatever features you're looking for. However, I can't open the damn thing without it prompting me to sign up for a subscription plan. To a notes app. Every. Single. Time. It can take a bit load, then when it's done loading you have tell the app that you want to use the free plan, because why would any one pay for a note taking app, then it's back to loading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my go to notes app for years now but I finally had to delete it. It's no longer useful for taking quick notes as everytime you open the app there are intrusive pop ups for paid services you have to click through. It's not worth the hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wrost apps in play store...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier the app was too good. But now a days, whenever I open a note, an add appears and that too,is very hard to close. I open notes for a quick reference / to quickly write something and these advertisements of the same app is really distracting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has been so great, EXCEPT FOR NOW. Forcing upgrades by no longer allowing notes in established accounts is lame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nearly impossible to get support for your queries... I've less than 50 notes still I'm not able to create a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its annoying when they're always putting the ad for the promos/subscriptions. I used to love this app so much, but I have to look for a new app that can give me unlimited notes for my things and could sync with my google acct."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"yo, the notebook and note limitations are a joke, and obvious cashgrab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please fix portrait screen glitch for password. Whenever the initial paasword is asked some digits do not appear at all. The screen has to be horizontal in landscape."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Update: Evernote has corrected the issue. Paid for professional subscription 1/13, upgrade still not reflected on my account. Only automated non-responses from support thus far. Have had evernote for 13 years, considering switching to OneNote at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What do you mean by charging 450 Rs per month from students. I was dependent on Evernote for all my notes and now being a student I can't afford it anymore. I have to switch now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent update is garbage. ALL of my tasks were deleted and the widgets and clipper don't work. You destroyed what was once a perfectly functional app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As soon as I downloaded this, im being spammed with ads to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for almost 10 years now and over the last 2 or 3 years it's just be getting worse and worse... Sad to see walk away from it but now I suddenly can't make any new notes even after deleting 50+ notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"stay away. it is not what it used to be. There are many other good alternatives to NeverNote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"f u 4 50 notes limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Popups are incessant and annoying. I shouldn't have to pay a subscription to make notes on my own phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good functions. Make me more organised"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Spamming me to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No more free plans, had Evernote since 2012 sadly removed all my notes and moved elsewhere...Far too expensive..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Ever in the name of the app turns out to be untrue. I have Android 7.0 on my phone. They are cancelling support in March 2024. App just tells me to update to a newer version. Of course I cannot without getting a new phone. So much for Ever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Is Evernote back at the leading edge? Just downloaded yet another version and I am truly baffled: it finally now make sense, features are usable and after a test drive of more than 30 minutes most looks fine and quite reliable. My 10000+ notes synced fine ( first time ever with any 9.x or 10.x) and look as they should. It seems that I will finally be able to upgrade past the legacy 8.x"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App keeps crashing and is full of bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was probably one of the first users of this app. I started using it in 2010 after I found it by accident. It was a great app. Then they started harassing you to buy the app. It was a free option back in 2010. For my purposes, taking occasional notes, I didn't have a need for any other use. Therefore, I didn't purchase it. But, I got tired of the harassment, so I decided to un-install the app. I will use Microsoft."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I been using this app to write simple subjects whenever I need to without a real notebook and Evernote has been very useful for me over the years however recently I have come to strongly dislike their new changes and customs of their latest updates. The paid subscription pestures me everytime I come to type down something on my notes and I hate that, what's more is their new features on the interface made the app's performance regress and made it sluggish. Lay off the paid subscription at least."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Be careful. Evernote crashes frequently on my Zfold 4. Only with the screen open. When using only the front screen there are no crashes. You always crash with open screen when choosing ""new note"" or after searching. Dd 26-2-24 crashing not resolved yet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was easy to use. Easy to create and amend notes. File into notebooks. Always backed up to the web. However, they added all kinds of features I don't use. Now they hound me to pay huge amount of money for premium service. DELETE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New app is terrible. Opening a note takes 15 seconds on new Samsung Fold. Such a shame they broke this app so much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to use it for making some quick notes. Sadly everytime I open the app I get bothered by ""last offer to buy premium"". If you keep bothering with a last final offer it isn't a last offer. Prevents me to make quickly some notes. Very annoying. Used to be much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a good simple notetaking app but recently they started limiting free features just too much and constantly pushing you too upgrade. Plus there is this really annoying featured that Evernote just takes over a bunch of shortcut keys and then you have to figure out how to disable this. I am switching to Google Keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app but like all apps that turn paid, you either pay or get a terrible experience. Once you reach the 50 note limit it's done, even deleting notes won't reset it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"At first I was angry, but now I'm grateful to Evernote for making my experience as a free user so frustrating and unbearable that I developed enough motivation to discover and fall in love with an another app. Thank you for that and for the early years of our relationship."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Dr did"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pay $150 a year or lose all functionality. How about I pay nothing and you go to hell, evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update just tries to do too much. Also premium plan is way too expensive for a subscription (paying that amount and more forever?) — seems unreasonable for a lot of users who were using it for free all along."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hii... Its a very good app but I'm not able to update the new version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I got this app several years ago as a free note keeping app. I loved it. It was just what I needed. Now I can't access my notes without navigating several screens trying to get me to upgrade to a paid version. I'm hating it now. I just want to be able to access my notes without being harassed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used evernote for over 12 years. I like it, I've paid for it for most of those years, despite the price. Now I have to move to another app because you no longer provide support for my systems. In this day and age, big apps like this should be able to provide support for older OS. That it's more important with ""innovation"" than functionality or environmental protection shows just how guided by money they are. Pretty sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was once the standard in notetaking is now reduced to a money-making scam. HORRIBLE. Used them for 10 years. Recommended them to at least 50 students and teachers. I have gone back to them and told them of my DISAPPOINTMENTS: constant Interruptions with sales pitches, increased cost of usage which, heretofore, was free, user-unfriendly design, and constant updates with each opening of their app, Hopefully the new take-over firm will sell Evernote to a more worthwhile parent. UNINSTALLED."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Occasionally freezes up and requires a phone restart"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since the update it constantly crashes, doesn't save what I write even though I check it to do so. I'm not going to use it and will have to transfer everything to something else so I don't loose it all. First time I've ever had problems with it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest Evernote is HORRIBLE and their customer support is just as bad. Evernote has lost their way & they don't care..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to me my note taking app for a long time. It was buggy and slow, but I've used it for 10 years or so, so I was never going to change... until they introduced a limit of 50 free notes and charge an exorbitant amount for premium. I ain't paying for a slow buggy note taking app, and at such a high price. Bye bye Evernote. You've made me look for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New limitations on devices, number of notes, notebooks, plus annoying popups and repeated security breaches make Evernote a loser for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit reached?? I had a paid account and switched to free now I can't create any notes. It is not worth even $0 if you can't use the app.. pretty worthless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have saved so many notes on evernote. And now it doesn't work as it used to work. Even if I sign out from my mobile to login my Evernote account on laptop, I can't. If I am using it on one device at a time by signing out from one device, then what's the issue?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money hungry app. Limit to 50 notes, I've deleted down to 30+ notes yet still not allowing me to add notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep spamming for upgrade.. Indicated one account is 50 note.. Mine is only 18note and I can't continue.. Pathetic.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sketching is broken in the latest version. I'm able to draw the first line but after that I only get short pieces of the lines that I'm trying to draw. Another problem is that opening existing notes sometimes freezes forever. And yet another issue: annoying ads almost every 5 minutes. And yet another: old versions (that did not have the bugs) stop working from march 2024. Time to switch to another app! ""Joplin notes"" does the job for me. It is free, open source and allows import from Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's absolutely disgusting how much they ask you to pay, $160 dollars a year. I used to love this app... But now plan to transfer all my notes to Obsidian, and deleting this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Making one pay $150 P/a to write notes is ridiculous. I've already lost all my content, now I can't write anything for free. Used to be a great app but clearly it's gone to the dogs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have not found a better software for my need. I can use it on my PC and then have it synched to my phone, tablets, and all equipment. I feel secure knowing no matter where I go I have my records in my back pocket. I also like the fact that they update frequently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Confuse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The latest update now makes it unusable unless you're premium. Thank you Evernote for the years of note-taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was my first ""Notebook"" app and I used it for quite a while. I really loved it. It was user friendly and very easy to use. But it’s time for me to move on. I really think you should have surveyed your users before you changed it so drastically to a paid only app. I had over 300 notes, files etc. on this app. To change it to 50 free notes and not being able to add any additional without paying was harsh. I have moved onto Notion. I works just as well and I have been using it for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unfortunately, it was a good 8 good year with Evernote. It was the only app that allowed users to merge cells and promoted a neat UI. I must say that I felt Evernote grab my neck with their sudden announcement of free version limitation for 50 free notes only, this was released on the new year I guess without any announcements earlier. In order for users to decide or swift to other app, buy that's how they did it, by forcing.  I found alternative upnote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the forced logout, I'm unable to authenticate into the app using Google sign-on. Tried resetting password but didn't get any link over email."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Piece of junk! I've used Evernote for over 10 years. An now they just want to be greedy. Can't sync this and can't do that. I think I will just find a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the heck happened to this app? I can't even make new notes anymore even though I haven't hit the supposed limit of one notebook and 50 notes? Every time I try to make a new one I get an ad for the paid version. Go elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgrace of na app! Making us pay now for wanting to access already saved stuff? This is intolerable. Deleting it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Insanely expensive for basic features. Popups. Unintuitive formatting. No idea how this app is popular."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app is my second brain"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"We only are allowed 50 notes for the free version but you cannot erase a note to create a new one. $15 a month for Premium! That cost is rediculous for whag it does. Unfortunately I have a lot of notes stored on Evernote or I would change to another. Once you get Premium, you can cancel at any time - but you will never have access to all those notes you made! I was offered 1/2 rate, but ad wouldn't allow me to go lower to click enter!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Read the critical reviews before you download this, not just mine... this used to be a great app. I have used this for years. Now every time you open it it prompts you to buy. Then it says are you sure you will not be offered this again. You confirm no you've just been interrupted twice before you can do anything. Annoying enough. But then the next time you open the app you discover that the Road Scholars have had a change of heart and want to offer the same deal again! And again, and again!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They ruined it with the recent update. It's slowly gotten worse over time; decreasing the amount of devices you can be logged in on, moving the best features behind a paywall, and increasing the cost of membership drastically. Now, I can only have 1 NOTEBOOK AND 50 NOTES. THAT'S IT.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: No longer useable with a hard cap at 50 notes and a few devices.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"UPDATE 23 Feb 2024: Since Bending Spoons has taken over development of this app, it has not been as good. My latest complaint is changing my settings after an update. Also, the 'Provide Feedback's option inside the app doesn't seem to work.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How the mighty have fallen. The new 50-note limit makes the app unusable, and obviously was only implemented due to greed. And now I get nag emails telling me to upgrade my Android version or lose access, but it won't let me; it's stuck at version 8.something and won't update because I'm perfectly happy with my non-Android 10 phone.

If you are just getting started with Evernote save your money and run far away as quickly as you can.

I purchased annual subscription after paying Rs 2399 INR through Google store but it doesn't recognize my subscription.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The constant ads to promote its premium (paid) account makes it almost unusable. They also change the details of what is available for a free account, even after using it for years, and you'll eventually lose access to create any notes if they've decided you have too many when they change the max allowed."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be a really useful app, but Evernotes drive to monetise it now renders it virtually useless unless you pay their extortionate subscription."

If it actually worked it would be a nice app. It refreshes the page while you are in the middle of the sentence. If you jump between apps (browser etc), it will only give you a blank page that is loading the note once you come back. Monthly limits are not a problem, but I will not pay for an app that doesn't even work properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not happy with the recent subscription requirements. I've been a casual and avid user of Evernote but now I can't even add new notes.

They want over $100 a year to make notebooks? I use this once a year typically and make 1 note book a year. I would pay for this app but not $100 a year. I see your rating is plummeting. I can't imagine why..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow, evernote really has the audacity to charge people $130/year to type notes. Yea, right, I'll go back to pen and paper first. I've been using this app religiously for 10 years. My life is ingrained on this app. Now I'm limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes? I have 20 notebooks and 582 notes. This was the perfect note app, journal, diary, planner, and life organizer. It always comes down to greed. Absolutely ridiculous. To anyone looking for a replacement, OneNote by Microsoft is good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was my life for over a decade. The changes over the past couple of years HURT ME. The inspiration to finally write a review was when I accidentally backspaced in a note on mobile and it erased the audio recording and after searching online I've found no way to undo or restore the recording. On top of that, some audio tracks haven't saved properly and just raise an error instead. The UX changes since the major redesign (last year?) ruined it for me. Edit: 2 years later, still broken."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would have been more than happy to keep using it under the $50/year Evernote Plus plan I've used for years. Suddenly that plan is gone and I'm now on the Personal plan that costs nearly 3x as much. No thank you."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved it originally and have been using it to store and organize notes sporadically, but I just updated it and lost everything. I wasn't given the chance to even copy the notes out, and now multiple sentimental writings are lost. I mean it was probably stupid to trust a new app to keep them safe, but I did after the original note app I used was glitching out too. I have never minded ads or the like, but the new changes are awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is excellent. Having spent ages using OneNote and finding the whole experience frustrating, laggy and unstable everNote was an absolute breath of fresh air. I signed up for a free trial (which they should make longer that 7 days) somewhat annoyed at the prospect of paying for something when I'm already paying Microsoft for OneNote. The difference is radical. It's amazing how different these two apps are. Let's just say I don't resent paying now, everNote is truly excellent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was a great app when it was free. It is absolutely, no way, not worth $130 per year. The greedy new owners ruined it. I understand the need for profit, but $130 per year is lunacy."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Lo tengo en mi Xperia sp, ipad y lap.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Regrettably, this app has been getting worse and worse. The format of my note kept getting messed up and some of my notes consistently went missing. Evernote keeps offering discounts for upgrades when my current version is very much subpar for a paid note taking app. With this issues, Evernote has become consistently and increasingly unreliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and it's only gotten worse over time. Half the time notes don't load, they don't save what I write, I'm unable to make any changes because it's 'checking for updates to the note'. I officially give up. I will be migrating all my notes to anywhere else, I don't even care if it's the dreaded One Note. (Edit: I've even had the paid $70/year plan for 4+ years now, it's not even an issue of ads. It's simply a disfunctional and unreliable app)"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I love evernote, have used it for years. But this app is Incredibly frustrating. As a paid user, there needs to be more offered for the price. I can get an entire package with Microsoft for similar money. And why does it need to pop up asking for location access every time? It's a note app! Further to this, I'm now a fully paying user, the app is still really laggy for a notes app I need it to be really quick to jot down quick ideas, it is not"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Auto-rotate to landscape mode even if the auto rotate is turned off on the android is a frustrating feature on the new update. We don't need auto rotate without permission. This is ridiculous on the feb 2024 update. Please, remove this useless frustrating feature. There is already rotation option in every ios or android phone!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using Evernote many years. I gave 5 stars in 2019. Now...this is most annoying app I ever saw. Popups to upgrade to the paying plan all the time. But literaly all the time. And it is working very very slow last year. So, go away from this app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another one fallen to disgusting corporate greed. Free tier is useless now and subscriptions are insanely overpriced. Good riddance, Evernote. You were too annoying lately, anyway."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Looking for Evernote Alternative. Day by day Evernote become worsen. Disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app since 2013. I will no longer use this app as the new owners (Bending Spoons) are after one thing and one thing only; profit. I have been using the paid version up until last year. Since I did not resubscribe to the paid version, a pop-up to upgrade happens with every click in the app. Dont download this app and dont support such a greedy company. Proceed with caution if you dare to download this piece of junk. I recommend using Notion Labs instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Years of terrible performance on mobile, and they have slowly increased limitations for free accounts, now limited to only one device, making its primary purpose moot. With no multi-device support, what exactly is the benefit of using this over a literal local storage text editor?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Change went in without notice. Now impossible to log in."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"While the app was useful and I have been paying for the last 2 years, the 50% increase in price made me reconsider my options. Sorry, Evernote, but this was too big of an increase to ignore it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use this for about 8 year and was once a brilliant app for notes. Now you have note limitations and constantly spammed with upgrade ads as well as being incredibly glitchy when in use sometimes particularly in split screen modes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am so very sad that I have to leave this app behind. I've been married to it for a decade & rec'd it to so many people. Over the last year, it's become such a nuisance to deal with that I actually take more physical notes & I resorted to finding a new app to use altogether. ~ repetitive pop-up ads, some of which don't even have an x or no option to close them ~ suddenly, I have too many notes, so i cleared & consolidated dozens of notes, & it still won't let me make more without upgrading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used free for years then suddenly constantly bugged for payments and now canycreate anything so will have to delete them all and the app. Evernote killed their app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you want subscribers, don't make the cost past outrageous. You switched to a subscription model and made yourself look greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great for keeping all your notes but can be glitchy and not as searchable as the reviews claim..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Back in the day this used to be a good note taking app. Now this is just a cash-cow. They ruined the entire app, making it more complex to naviagte, while also forcing everyone to pay for premium. On top of that, the app became noticably slower. Using your phone's native note all is 10x more productive and Free. Hopefully this gets removed from the app store entirely as it probably just exists to scam unaware people out of money."

I tried to create a new note and it told me I'd hit my 50 note limit, but I only had 22. They want over $100 for their cheapest plan. No way. I've moved everything over to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for atleast 6 years and I used it every single day and loved it. Now it's just another money grabbing app pushing huge prices with the absolute minimum to offer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My favorite app to make notes and organize my every day routine. I like that I can still make notes even if I'm offline. I think there are a very few similar apps on the market, and Evernote is one of the best by now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You want me to pay more than $50 just to create simple notes?! There are much better options, and whoever suggested the idea of putting such a high price for a note app is with all respect incompetent. I already and very easily found another option and switching to it. For example Google keep, Microsoft Notes, Diarium .. etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pop ups will never go away to purchase a subpar app. no deleting notes in bulk. disappointed to have to search for a new note taking app as I have just been overly annoyed for the past 2 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can organize myself easily With this tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now you can't access anything without pop-ups asking to upgrade. I can't even create a new note, even though I'm way under the 50 note max."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years as paying subscriber, in Jan on opening the app, a screen said I must remove 2 devices. That done, I found that I couldn't access my notes before paying $14.99. Thank you Evernote! I had been dissatisfied for some time with how slow your app responded (often a couple of seconds from key stroke to screen and your random 3-8 sec delays refreshing a note in progress). I would not have made the switch had it not been for being extorted ($14.99 well spent!) Now using a fast FREE one!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just switched phones today, and I'm shocked that when I tried updating my notes on Evernotes (had since 2011), it says I can't make a new note because I reached my plan limit!? Come to find out, I'm not the only one going through it. I've kept notes here forever, and now this? $100+ annually to continue. I used to like the simplicity of it, and now it's just difficult because of what developers did to it, but I still use it because my notes are still here. Guess I gotta look somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps saying no network connection even when my internet is okay and other apps are functioning well. I was able to sign in but was not able to sync anything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I guess I'm giving a low rating now because I can no longer use it. I surpass my 50 notes a long time ago and I can't use it now. I must upgrade and pay $130 a year for it to store my notes/journal entries. I love the text editing functions and that's why I used it for journaling but now I have switched over to Samsung notes for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So sweet I love it🏅🏅🏅"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was my favorite for over 10 years, but now it has gotten unbearable. It worked perfectly for all my purposes but now they want me to pay an unreasonable amount just for the most raw, ground level and basic of features like... CREATNG A NOTE. Go get Obsidian instead, it's amazing, full of great features and free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I'm not gonna complain about the note limit, as for paid accounts that's not the case. HOWEVER, paying that much you would assume that the experience would be top notch. But, there are so many issues. Opening a note from a widget is buggy as f. It rarely opens the selected note. Most of the times it opens/closes the note in a matter of milliseconds and then after a wait it just opens the app. Meaning that the widgets are completely useless. You cannot rearrange tasks/check lists. Many more..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Customer service is non-existent. I've been trying for months to speak to someone in customer service re issues I'm having - they REFUSE to provide a number BUT are happy to almost double the yearly renewal. Email correspondence doesn't cut it, I need to SPEAK to someone about the issues. I've been using Evernote since 2012, and this is the thanks I get for their paid services."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since I wrote the below review, the hoops you have to jump through and offers you have to decline just to open any note has gotten ridiculous. Time to find a new notes app. I have auto-rotate turned off on my phone and ever note still automatically rotates. Annoying. I also don't want to have to dismiss upgrade ads every time I open a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be so good I was a loyalyzer for years, since 2015 to be exact, and I finally got around to deleting this thing. It has become awful, pain in the posterior to use. Non-stop "" upgrade now!"" Ads prevent you from smoothly using any of the features. It has a horribly outdated file transfer (I had to painstakingly copy and paste all of my notes out of it, like it was holding them hostage). Switched to Google keep, never going back 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was an excellent app. I was forced to migrate to it from Springpad, but now it's forcing me to upgrade to a paid plan: not in the 21st Century!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Put a paywall up such that basic features are not available and makes the app suck for any free users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app increased users and than stopped working for free users despite disconnecting additional devices. If paid they will demand more and more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"UI is mediocre, constantly being asked to upgrade to a paid plan is beyond obnoxious and the reason I'm looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The free version is limited to 1 notebook with 50 notes? This app has forgotten its old ways"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So now I can't make anymore notes without paying a fee. It says 50 free notes but I only have 25. Looks like I will be finding a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The most annoying app ever Every effin time you open it it asks if you want to pay for it, and then it says ""are you sure? It's an exclusive offer"" yeah you've asked 10 thousand times, It would be a good app if it wasn't a psycho harassing son of a ... Deleting forever, see you never!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I finally closed my account after over 10 years. They kept removing features until the app was practically useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have the free plan and it clearly states that I can have one notebook and 50 notes. I only have 32 notes in my current notebook and it won't let me make any new notes it just keeps telling me I need to upgrade and my plan only allows 50 notes. When you fix it so the free service works maybe I'll consider upgrading. I've had the service for four years and never had a problem so I'd like to keep using the app if y'all fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"GREAT app but the constant barrage of ads to upgrade, is tedious & annoying - it wasn't always like this. I'm now having to delete/opt out 2-3 ads before I can get to my notes, EVERYTIME I open the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"129€ par an sinon c'est limité à 50 notes... Une honte... Je désinstalle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is so slow and the widgets downgraded enough that I feel discouraged to even use evernote, eventhough i Pay for it...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really annoying ads that keep asking me for subscription everytime I tried to access my old notes without an end. Will soon uninstall the app if this madness continues. Very pathetic UX"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new payment scheme removed access to decade old notes, cool, thanks..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too expensive, more than Netflix 🤔😵‍💫 the most I'll pay a month for this is $7 maybe $8"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years and lived it foe the ease and security. Now suddenly it is limited and they are pushing you to purchase the premium edition. It's intrusive and frankly I may have to switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be useful for making notes, but now every. SINGLE. action. you try to make causes at least one pop up, usually two, asking you to pay and they've massively restricted the amount of notes you can make. Just did some research on the company and it looks like they were recently acquired by an Italian firm, laid off their staff, and moved to Europe. So, essentially a different company using the name recognition of what was once a great app. Absolutely would NOT recommend nowadays."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Update Feb 2024: bugs & issues are gradually getting fixed. Thanks Bending Spoons! Update Dec 2023: newer versions are decent, but still have tons of bugs and issues. Paid user for 12 years but I use legacy versions in both Windows and Android. Because the current versions suck (no manual sync, auto features result in losing work, UI is not user-friendly, homepage is useless, too much interruption by ""limited time offers"", etc). The company refuses to listen to beta testers and end users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The unpaid version of this app is quite glitchy with many bugs, making it unreliable. Due to its flaws, I've lost valuable notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is unusable now. Other note apps offer more features for free & evernote wants a ridiculous amount of money to provide the same or less services. I'm moving my notes over to another app & deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye and thanks for the helping since 2017 evernote. This is non sense to make a limit to create news notes for users. And guys, there are lots of alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am very disappointed that you now need to pay to add new notes and it's nearly impossible to even use it without paying because of so many popups. and it's not even cheap at $20 a month!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gone down the pan. Used to love Evernote but now u can't use without it trying make me buy plans. Says I can have one notebook with 50 notes free. I have one notebook with 8 notes and can't create any new ones. I'll be going elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app but now it says my limit is reached (50 for free version) and wants me to pay a ridiculous cost to continue using the app. I even deleted old notes I no longer needed putting me at 37 notes and it still won't allow me to create a new note w/o upgrading. Such bs! Guess I'm done with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app now absolutely trash they made limits on creating notes, I'll look for another similar app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Superb app! Easy to use and really secure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had the free version for years. It used to be awesome. It's been slowly going downhill. Now, you really can't even use the free version at all due to the popups. Sometimes three in a row will interrupt you asking you to upgrade. There's not even a ""no"" option. You have to click on ""other plans"" and then ""stick with free version"". It's so annoying, I'd never even consider the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"income for you and your family are well 😉😉"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrific experience on Android. It's closing every 5 minutes. Before the update after the update. Before clearing the cache, after clearing the cache. Before restarting after restarting. Evernote has been a good starting app for the setup of my secondbrain (PC). But, trust me, our time together will not be long. I will be moving onto something that doesn't actually make me dislike it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"buggy on pixel 6 - for example my yearly subscription stops working maybe about every 2 weeks and I need to reinstall etc. Also the feedback-button doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"app used to be great before it became a money grabber. this app isn't complicated. the format is easy to understand. my beef is that when it went pay/for/play, I had almost no options, so I deleted things I didn't want to. simply put-i used to highly respect this app. I would probably piss on it if it were on fire, but not with a full bladder."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has been super buggy. I only have 41 notes and it keeps telling me I've reached my limit of 50 free notes, expecting me to pay $160/year for a subscription. You guys need to fix this as I can't create any new notes. The constant barrage of ads to subscribe are getting out of hand. Will look to replace after having app for over 10 years. Smh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, number of notes now limited and accessing it from other devices (previously free facets of the app now cost) it's a bit disheartening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stuck the vast majority of it's functionality behind a paywall with about a week's notice. Busily transferring everything to OneNote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many problems! I get white blank screen everytime lately. It used to be much more reliable ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App now unusable since the recent paywall. Ive had this app for years and only now has it become quite probably a 30mb space waster on your phone. Please close down shop, set your offices on fire."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"5* to 1* - This is an absolute garbage app now, coming from an avid user of Evernote since 2013. I subscribed the last year or two, because I used this frequently, needed offline access, and wanted to try some of the new paid features. But lately I haven't been needing this as much and wasn't finding the ""features"" to be worth the cost, so I switched to the free version without realizing it has a limit of 50 notes, a complete joke for anyone that has been consistently using the app for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"All the new fees are too much! Can't even edit my existing notes. I deleted everything and switched to a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote! What is happening! I've been a customer for over 10 years. I loved this app and chose it over all the others by virtue of the long relationship and the great functionality. I can barely save a note now. Or retrieve attachments from old notes. Please fix this up! It's hindering my productivity big time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely disappointing, I change now from 5 stars to one star, we will not pay for that much for the change in subscription pricing, at the same time reducing our notes to 50 only??? You guys are making our lives much worst, not to mention the Table bugs you guys are still dealing with. After many years with you guys and limiting our notes, it's time I make preparations to exit your note taking app, the only way I'll come back is if you guys reverse your insanely crazy subscription price back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app until they make you pay for everything. It said I reached my note limit so I deleted some but still won't let me make anymore new notes. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work offline"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Opened it up to find I had been signed out of my acct. Can't get back to my acct. All my info is GONE. can't get ahold of anybody for some support. This app SUCKS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app! I call it, NeverNote. Bait and switch like others are saying. They let you use it for years and all of a sudden last month they don't let you use it without paying an insane amount of money for annual subscription. Not that great of an app and they got greedy! Uninstall!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible now, keeps asking for money every 2 minutes with only 36 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the free app for years, it worked great. They messed up the workflow, can't access anything without being bombarded with messages to pay $100+ per year. Do not get this app if you don't want to pay!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bye bye Evernote 🥺🥺 i was very old user now i want to switch notion is hard but hope one day i will be comfortable with notion , Evernote asking money for create notes 😳😳 any way takecare Evernote. Hope we haven't meet again, after uninstall 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From the increasing slow downs over the past couple years, to the ever expanding of widgets, clutter and notification pop ups, to now the abysmal plan changes, this app has really gone down the drain fast. From 100000 notes (not that I ever needed that many) down to 50? Ridiculous. And with no real warning, only once you've hit the new limit? The only reason I'll keep it installed is because I already have many notes stored and they haven't (as of yet) decided to delete any excess of 50 (yet)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the app for years, now with white screen issue, and keeps suggesting to pay. No thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lost notes. The free version stopped working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app since 2017. They changed the layout but in order to save how you reorder the widgets you have to pay. You have to pay to sync across multiple devices, basically they changed it from free to, pay for everything you do. Today I copied and pasted all my notes and emailed to myself. And I am un-installing this. It's no longer more useful than Keep Notes. Or a pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"firstly, its good with sync, even compatible with pc and mobile at a time and convenience it was awesome before but now there are too many conflicts, like when i work on pc with any other official software and I copy my work related data then it get copied or pasted only for Evernote even this app is closed and i was not able to paste my copied data to related sheets... after some time i get irritated literally and uninstalled this......please fix it..am missing Evernote.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It constantly requires force quitting to even launch the app or show me my notes. Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you have to pay to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using since 2014 and it is great app but they have introduced very high price which is not possible to everyone, they should introduce affordable and flexible plans to increas the usability of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"very nice and Helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cancelled the free trial before it expired but still got charge for it. There's no way for me to contact them at all. Now it is the 3rd week I am being charged!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is awful I'm so disappointed to this app he/she want to pay money for this apps (using son)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editing an decade-old review to say this is a trash/scummy app now that is not worth your time or money. If you took the time to read this, you should know to look elsewhere. They have made this non-functional for old users (retroactive note limits at f'in 50, booooooo) and have totally lost my trust; evil and greed embodied. Shame all involved. Shameeeeeee"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very satisfied"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been using Evernote actually longer than I thought. When it was free. It was awesome. Then they started charging, which is fine; this is a great app! Went to apple for a bit, then came back to my love for Android. This app started getting progressively expensive. I think it was a pay once thing. Then it was 5$ a month, to 10$ a month. My last straw when it was almost 20$ a month. Like ok... I get it, but for 20$ you gotta provide more than just an app. Install a shh option, encryption method"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's working as it is now but paid subscription is so expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow app, always asking for a subscription, free plan limits you to only 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love that my not taking app of years that has me held hostage spams an ad every time I open it asking me to subscribe. Infuriating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yeah new payment system and free sub is totally unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier it ws an awesum app to store notes and retribe them easily. But recently with updates, they ask only for paid upgrade and doesnt let u work. Also 50 notes free said, but they prompt to upgrade to paid even after 30 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years and it's worked perfectly, now I keep getting annoying popups when I'm trying to open anything. I'm not even close to the 50 notes limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"5000 per year !! Bye Bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had been using this app for many years with no issues. Recently the app has not been working well, the notes do not save properly (which is the one job it is supposed to do). And now the app is constantly asking me to upgrade my plan with intrusive and repetitive pop-ins, and does not allow me to create new notes. No I won't pay for writing notes, good bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In the past I was able to print. The print option has been deleted in the newest version. This is a real bummer. As of 3/2/21, print function still not working. Don't like the new forced membership that is know in place. I have been a member since 2010. You are going to screw up a great app. This change that just started at the end of 2023 is bad for people like me. I'm really invested in your app and now you have stuck it to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and have been happy with it. However all of a sudden everytime I login I get pop ups and requests to upgrade to premium. Stop bombarding your users or we'll just switch apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app. I would use it for quick notes while traveling and researching articles. Now all they want is money. For $130 a year, you could just pay for MS office and use OneNote. Only having 50 notes and one notebook in the free version is pointless. I was so mad I even closed my account. So should you out of protest. Evernote? More like Nevernote now!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Has been with EN since 2014 or eralier. Has been one of the early subscriber of this app. Used to pay about $50? a year. Now they tried to debit $100+ from my credit card without notifying me and without my consent. Lucky my credit card was expired. I am prepared to switch to any other notes as my notes are not important. Plus i am not very satisfied with the search function."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage app. No option to save notes elsewhere, and now there's a 50 note limit until you have to pay $130. 😂 -10/5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems what was once a great app, is now an obnoxious monetization engine. I have been a user since 2014. Time to say bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Super annoying pop ups. Avoid unless your prepaid to pay $$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user since 2011 only using Evernote for VERY basic note keeping, but during 13 years of use I accumulated over 1000 notes. With the new 50 note policy, I can't create any new notes or notebooks and now have to pay a ridiculously high subscription fee to get basic functionality back, which feels like extortion. This is after having been bombarded w/ an insane quantity of pop-ups for a year+. At least I could export my data. Now I have to see how I'm going to get it into Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a very public friendly application turned into a massive revenue land grab. No easy cheap subscription it went straight to premium prices. No thanks, leaving after 10 years of being a fan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth what they are charging, considering how many other good options exist out there, and with such a steep escalation in pricing, it may not be wise to bet your data on the company's longevity... Long time customer, though not much longer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update made the app slow. Takes a long time for my notes to load even on wifi."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Excellent app however, it doesn't seems to work on my new pixel 7. Can't even log in. Also, as another user stated, the persistent ads to switch to a premium are quite annoying. Update 2/14/24: No, seriously, I Don't Want To Upgrade! Removing a star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've started chasi6ng me without permission, and won't respond to my complaints. After having my card cancelled, they've somehow acquired my new card, and have charged me again. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS PRODUCT. CRIMINAL, RELENTLESS THEFT."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's wrong with app, I keep getting white screen, can't check my notes.. And I'm sick of the pop ups to subscribe.. I'm using this app for the past 10 years.. Now it's getting worse and worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app experience is so full of ads now that it's fairly unusable. I recommend a different note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app, but good luck trying to find out how to make your payment every month. I just spent an hour trying to figure out how to do it and I still don't know."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free version used to be great. Now you can only have 50 notes, one notebook, and you are inundated with pop-ups to upgrade every time you open the app. Now I use Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pretty slow and prone to hanging, that's not what we need from a productivity app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Such a money hungry app. Constantly asking you to upgrade with ""limited time"" offers that aren't actually limited. Each time you close it, upon next open it's right back in your face requiring you to hit ""X"" or ""no"" like 3 times to get around the upgrade request. The functionality of the app is fine besides that. Could use some more basic typing features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once a 5 star app, used to be an incredible notepad. Still has great U.i and nice features, but in the past couple years they implemented a note limit, and you can't access your notes without closing 1-4 ads that are hard to close ( Tiny X outs, always asks ""are you sure?""), depending on the day. I'm stuck because it already has my most important notes, but surely there is a better option for you all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Obnoxious, intrusive ads. This used to be my main note taking app but I'm transitioning to Google notes just so I don't have to deal with multiple full page at every time I load this up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Kept on bombarded with subscription options. Almost not usable if one is poor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You're limited to one computer at the free tier and it pesters you every single use to upgrade to the paid tier, ironically offering you the same one time offer every time. This stinginess leaves me so ill-disposed towards the product that I will never upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this service for 11 years as a paid customer. It was all good until 2020. Since then, it has been getting worse and worse. Terrible app, useless if you want to take quick note with photo and save it - it will last long time to save it and even might not save note at all, unreliable, very slow, and after I logged out I can't even log in, jut nothing happens when I write correct password. In addition, it very long time to get reply from customer service. Time to change to competing services"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moving to Microsoft one note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Infelizmente com a versão paga e várias propagandas não consigo mais usar gratuitamente."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is horrible. It used to work, but now every time you use it, there's pop ups begging you to pay $130/year just to keep notes. What a freaking joke. It won't let me make any more notes and I have less than 50. Do not download"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A very versatile note taking app. I however wish you could lock certain notes, pages, etc so only YOU can see them with a password or pin"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they are wanting monthly payments for differnt thikngs...UNISTALLED"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes limit? no thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I paid a lot of money to this app by now lol."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's actually quarter a star. Was good. WAS. What happened?Firstly the limit quota even after deleting previous notes? LOL. and the unable to sign in another account? talk about cash grabber. find other alternative. this app is soon dead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. With all the new ""updates"" it has gone downhill"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used it for everything until they wanted me to pay more per month than Netfix! Now there are so many ads, it's unusable, especially with a 50 note limit! Holding my data for ransome seems unethical to me, so once I download the most critical notes, I'm done. Google keep does most of what I need for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is very slow to load, kept duplicating the note pad and notes on its own... Recently they reduced the features on the free plan, now there is a 50 note limit and you can only use the app on one device, no more sharing notes between phone and desktop. Cash grab that I'm not buying in to for a mediocre app so I've switched to another notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible, limiting the number of Notebooks in the free version made it useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculously overpriced subscription - will switch to Notesnook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was told it was free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"installed it after a long time.. my god so many pop ups ask u to spend money on the app.. why.. I used to like this app.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My team and I have used Evernote for 8 years. It was perfect for our needs up until the most recent updates. No more work chat? This app is basically useless to us now. We're transitioning to something new and dropping Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be very effective and comfortable to use, with helpful tools and templates, but now it's just bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely a joke since they changed their concept 2 months ago. They use annoying advertising to push their sales. Every time I open the app there pops up a window to ""choose a plan"". Literally, don't use this app. It used to be amazing and now it's just rubbish to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Truly boreing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a amazing app now its completely garbage and unusablel do not waste your time or moeny get a different note app thats not owned by scummy sellouts that try to charge you almost two hundred dollars a year to use a freaking notepad app 😂😂 like you got be stupied or dumm rich if you would pay that also if someone Involved in that idea is reading this you're a Idiot you could have just charged like $15 a year. And then you would have kept a lot of the people that liked this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years to store notes and checklists. Several Christmases have been planned entirely in this app for several years. All for free. Suddenly, I have to pay to create a new note. Deleted a bunch of old notes as they indicated 50 was the maximum allowed for free and I had more than that. Reduced my notes to those I really need, only 27 total, and I still cannot create a new note without paying. They want over $100 USD per year for the cheapest plan. DON'T GET EVERNOTE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Minus one star for each ad in a row"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used Evernote for 12+ years. Just to be fair, as of today - that is February 13, 2024 - I can still create free notes via email or the Web Clipper in Microsoft Edge. I can't afford the upgrade, but I feel like I owe Evernote a 5-star rating for being free all these years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Becoming worse and worse =("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is pushing there subscription so much that now it's almost impossible to use the app. I already partially switched to Google Keep and waiting to transfer my all notes to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to say goodbye, a great app that just got messed. A pity 😮‍💨"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer usable. Not going to pay. Been using this app since 2012. As of now I cannot make any more notes because it requires me to pay if I want to continue using it. Considering all the free note taking apps and even built in note apps on my phone, it does not make any sense for me to pay this much just to take notes. I think you're going to lose a ton of users from this, and you would have been better off making the free version have ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love the app but literally needed to stop using because it's ALWAYS showing me ads. I don't know why the app has to ask me to upgrade every single time I open it. I've clicked no about 1000 times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Pagalpan. Kuchh din bad Paise mangega. Lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS APP. I used to give Evernote 5* but it SUCKS NOW. The NEW OWNERS SUCK! They've RUINED IT! n my opinion is the best FREE note storage, organizer - writing app out there PERIOD!! I've literally tried dozens of other writing apps over the last 8 yrs. I've been using Evernote since the summer of 2012 as a personal journal and also to write and store poetry and other types creative writing projects."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Web won't load past login screen. Long notes don't load on mobile. Images in old notes don't load on desktop. I have many notebooks cuz I got the app years ago, but I can no longer move notes between notebooks cuz i'M OnLY sUPpOsEd tO hAvE oNe. Can't download notes in HTML or PDF w/o losing images/formatting. Sometimes editing on mobile makes the note duplicate w/in itself. SO MANY ADS. Not my only complaints. Had app for 5.5y, and past issues were fixed, but I'm done. So not worth the anxiety."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good until it got to aggressive we with its ads. I have to click several buttons to remove their deals every single time I open the screen. It's ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a frequent user of this app since 2016 and have created hundreds upon hundreds of notes. Recently the app is unusable since they decided a subscription was needed to create new notes in an app that now provides the same service as the free notes app downloaded on your phone. The pop-up ads for their own ""premium"" service make the app not only obsolete but unusable. The only reason to go back is if you haven't found a way to move your previously created free notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update 3 days ago is awful. This app was great before they removed the SEARCH OPTION (magnifying glass) & added Customiazble Wigets which aren't needed. My notes are already full, so i only need to search for what I need. When you scroll it keep GLITCHING & REPEATING the sane notes over & over. Please add the SEARCH icon back! Some things don't need to changed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the best app turned into the worst one. Instead of Removing ratings, try to run the company with a better vision. Utterly disgusted with note limit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not sure what happened. It used to be an amazing note-taking app a couple of years ago, but now i can't even create new notes because I'm limited to 50 on the free plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disapointed with this app. It looks okay, but functionality has basically regressed. Used to be way better 5+ years ago. Messed up the workflow for me. The widgets used to be better. Only two basic ones now, and there is now no way to sort by last viewed. Forces me to search over and over again. Search bar doesn't even have a shortcut to the last searched. Good for you that you made it impossible to export to OneNote, otherwise I would have switched long ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overpriced notepad. That's literally it. The same features can be done with Google docs or any other free notepad apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The application has experienced a significant decrease in its performance When attempting to reopen it from a minimized state ,instead of resuming from its previous position, it consistently launches from the home screen. This issue has persisted across multiple devices, including the OnePlus and the S24 Ultra."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After recent update i can't open any notes. After 3 seconds of entering the app, the screen goes to grey"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good interface with web and app access. Wish there was a way to support by paying that was not a monthly subscription for functionality that is free in gdocs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's says 50 free notes but I am only at 8 and it won't let me create anymore. Used to be a good app but now huge amount of ads and contrast upgrade requests. Shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is not accepted at all i have been using this app since 2014 and i was recommending it to other people But now there are many adds Also the app is not working a white page will dispaly that will preventing me from using the app i have alot of important things on the app but there are many apps better and free of charge"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"hate this app, used to be great now everything is stuck behind a paywall. whats the point? im switching to something else, hell google docs would be better than this awful pop-up microtransaction app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"apps alright, but the number of times I get asked to upgrade is infuriating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywall for more than 50 notes and/or 1 notebook. Unbelievable. The months of subscription popups when trying to make a quick note was bad enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unsurprisingly, like every other review here, the constant ad pop-up every day to upgrade is infuriating. Been using the app since 2013 & it was fantastic. Nothing wrong with adding a paid model but you're not going to win customers by forcing that expensive upgrade every time the app is opened with 3 layers of rejection before I'm free. My old review used to say: Does exactly what I hoped it would, very useful day in & day out! -- Doubt it'll ever go back to being a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very nice service and good work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using and loving this app for 10 years, but I guess I need to find another note taking app this time. So sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They said i can't add new notes unless i pay. Deleted old ones and still get the message. Expensive as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote for years and suddenly now with the newest update I can no longer use this app. The fee is way too much for the service. They suddenly changed it so that if you don't pay $130 a year you can only have 1 notebook and 50 notes. This makes this app unusable to me because as I said I've been using this app for years and am way past that limit, so now it wants me to pay to use the same services I've had for free for years. This was a horrible decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This use to be the best app. Once you start writing or keeping notes, the damn app bombarded, and harassed me till I'm done with this app. Do not use. This is from someone that originally paid for this. And now they want to hold you hostage by holding your information against you. Which is my bad for trusting an app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand the business choice to increase limits to free users but this app has become almost non-functional on Android due to the amount of in-app pop ups to promote the paid version. AND within the web-based application it is 100% unusable due to those same ads and not having the ability to exit from the pop up and return to the note at hand. You either backpage to the home view or completely exit out. This along with other glitches I will be moving to another app, probably Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous amount of ads, every time I open it there's two ads right off the bat. Even if I close the app or switch to another & come back another ad pops up. As soon as I find another app to transfer my notes to I'll be deleting this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm sad to see it go, but I'm dropping Evernote as one of my go-to apps. I've had this app longer than most other apps on my phone, maybe like 9 or 10 years now. However, all the ads pushing their yearly subscription have gotten really annoying. Plus, the app tells me im at my limit for notes, despite having 11 other available note slots. I remember when this app was great and useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As someone who has been using this app for YEARS, I am pretty disappointed that I now have to pay to make over 50 Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps bothering me about upgrading and i have no intention of spending money on a note taking software. I can get google drive for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Effectively forcing free users to leave by suddenly blocking you from creating new notes. So long, it was fun while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A white screen is all you see after a few seconds of opening the app. I hope this gets fixed soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop spamming your overpriced subscriptions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changed my innitial review - se below from 5* to 1*. been paying for Evernote since it appeared but now it crashed on all devices. I cant acces my notes, important info, etc. Been going on for almsot a week and no feedback from the developer. Such a shame.... Old review - One of the most useful and user friendly programs! It's a must!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They changed the free plan and now I can't make any more notes even though my max hasn't been reached. I've followed the instructions to delete the trash too and I still can't make any more notes. Max is 50 and I only have 26. Used to love it but now I can't use it. Been a user since 2011. The cost for the plans is outrageous for what I use it for... basic note taking and task checking and brain dumps. I'll be finding a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the worst experience after using this for many years. I can't get into my notes without a rip off subscription. I will putters on social media if something isn't done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate this app. it used to be good but it just spams you constantly with adverts for premium, just **** off and let me journal in peace. I just realised that they retroactively limited me to 50 notes. Your app deserved crash and burn. What a scam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgraceful way to treat loyal users. This was a great app when I started using it a decade ago. Now, you can only create 50 notes and have to suffer constant pop-up ads trying to get money out of you. This app has become torture to use. I'm uninstalling Evernote now and will be using a superior (and free) alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"300 /500"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"since bringing in their recent changes that restrict you to one notebook and 50 notes, I've changed to a different app. however, the app won't let me delete my last remaining notebook and it's too much hassle to delete each note individually. this, I've emailed their DPO to enact my right to be completely forgotten and have all my data purged from their system instead so I can use Joplin and OneNote instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the free plan is unusable now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting the notes??? I've been using Evernote since 2019 and you guys now forcing me to pay for subscription to use this app?? Hell nah"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this religiously for 14 years and it's now useless because I cannot create anything new without paying some totally ridiculous price. I like what I like and HATE making changes, but that's not worth the price being asked. On the lookout for something better now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"was a good note app but constant pop-ups trying to get subscriptions is going to make me delete it soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Considering removing app due to the increased pay wall. They have recently locked multiple notebook functionality behind a subscription. Those who had multiple notebooks previously like myself cannot make new notebook OR notes until destroying our existing notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Past its sell by date, promises reneged on, android clients never worked well Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy when working off line. It continuously displays ""Opening note, please wait"". Can't search notes anyone. App is clogged up with additional, unnecessary tools. Evernote has forgotten why users chose them first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Way too expensive now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ASKS TO BUY EVERY 15 MIN W ANNOYING POPUPS. Un-installed. Stripped a TON of features. Can't create any new notes, limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes. No easy way to transfer /export data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Had been my go-to note taking app for over 10 years. Used to be simple, uncluttered, reliable. Now it requires wading through constant prompts to upgrade to the (very pricey) subscription version and has been so depopulated of features it's not worth the trouble. Way to ruin your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too much advertising! I don't know what happened to this app but every time I open it to take notes I get multiple prompts to upgrade my account. This is ridiculous and a huge turn off for me. I have moved to Google Keep where I get none of these annoying pop ups. Evernote use to be my favorite note taking app until they got greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had this app for many years but will have to unfortunately cancel my subscription because it is unusable on my phone it keeps crashing.I have tried everything.02.10.24 Update still doesn't work looks.like they don't care. Doesn't work on my Samsung z fold."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm sick of this app trying to sell me unlimited notes every time I open it. it's so ANNOYİNG to be asked ""are you sure?"" every damn time. I'm sick of it. Stop asking if I wanna upgrade repeatedly or else I'll uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been with them since 2017 and I could create all sorts of notes and books etc. Now I'm severely limited and the cost for yearly personal use is like $130 (cheapest option)?! Very disappointed by this company's greedy tactics."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update -- FIX YOUR WIDGETS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is great when purchased. The issue is that the price has almost tripled since I started using this app. Seriously! I stopped the month to month, I use the free service, but it's so complicated with the constant pop-ups. At the rate they are going this app will still not be worth the trouble. I use to recommend this app all the time but ashamed to now with the ridiculous cost!! 😕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't stop asking me to upgrade for paid plan, infinitely..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have only 1 note book and 34 of 50 notes but it says I have reached my limit. Will not be using anymore. Google Keep notes is a better free alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashing now. And every feature is now locked behind a paywall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use free Evernote. I received the prompt to upgrade because I reached the limit of 50 notes. So, I deleted 15 to 20 of old notes that I no longer needed. I am still receiving that prompt. It will not let me proceed. I will gladly change to 5 stars if the developer fixes this error."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a useful app with lots of cool options for writing notes (photo, scribble or type). Those options are still there but the app CONSTANTLY nags you to upgrade every time you do anything - add a note, edit a note. Every. Single. Time. In fact it's worse, I now can't create any new notes. The free version supposedly allows 50 notes. I only have 14 but get a popup to upgrade which I can't get passed. Emailed support but heard nothing. So if you plan on using the free version, don't."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Now it's a useless brick. They only want money. I can't make any new notes without giving them money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"3 stars is what this service deserves objectively, tops. Only recent reviews are valid, lots of paid reviews"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become ugly, greedy app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Bye bye Evernote, have had an account and been a subscriber since 2010. With a price increase of over 100% for 2024 I'm out..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work on my tablet any more. I've been obsoleted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"All my widget shortcuts to Notes on my home screen stopped working some months ago. Deleting and re-creating doesn't work. They open the app but not the Note. I keep expecting an update to fix the problem but nothing. Very unimpressed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I use to love it but they are making it harder and harder to us free version. Always promoting the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is the end 👋🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this might be the only app review I'll ever post in my life. This app is a steaming pile of garbage, dont download it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DON'T USE THIS APP! THEY LOST ALL OF MY NOTES AFTER USING AND DEPENDING IT... NO RECOURSE AND IT WAS PAINFUL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Ook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a brilliant app. Have used Evernote for around 13 years and has always been great for me. Free version was fine for what I needed. Then suddenly without warning they limited the free version to 50 notes and I get constant pop ups with a ""special offer"". I can still access and edit current notes but that's it. I'm not against moving to a paid tier but price is too high. Also glitchy nowadays."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App used to be amazing. Now it's just frustrating with the endless ads to upgrade. More frustrating, they can't be dismissed with a single click,l. Functionality seem to have taken a dive too. I'll be finding a better option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be really good, but it got so clunky due to ads/crashing to the point of being unusable. I stopped using it and switched to another notebook app, and just found out you basically have to have a membership to continue using this one anyway. Imo if they wanted to make money, they should have just charged a one time fee for the app and kept the services the same, instead of adding ""memberships"", or done crowdfunding like Wikipedia does yearly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"100$ to change my background picture in a note taking app i do not think so"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way too aggressive ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asking for a subscription cost pop up - consider updating the app to how it was before and I'll consider updating the review"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The program I knew and loved for 10yrs is gone; sold to B.S. in Nov22, and the remaining staff fired July'23. Problems IMMEDIATE. I have since had problems loading notes (endless buffering/loading), and no longer have note conflicts-- I simply lose the contents of the note. Not to mention the screen rotating despite my phone settings being locked? And ""ai"" offerings that I never wanted, much less want to pay extra for? Horrendous, can't wait to shift to a different app entirely. Rip Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"None"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Almost malware. Wish I could give a Negative review. I am removing all of my notes and uninstalling. I would never signbup for a service that TRYS SO HARD TO MAKE YOU SUBSCRIBE. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE MONEU TROUBLES . USE SOMETHING ELSE. MY ACCORDI JAS BEEN HACKED SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY HAVE 0 SUPPORT.If you value security This is NOT the app for you. Wow The Worst 2 Step verification ever. Still have logins in Russia and Asia. Think twice if you have personal info in this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now absolute garbage I've used Evernote for years, but then they sold to a horrible company. EVERY single time you log in, it's incessant and endless spam and pop-ups trying to make you upgrade. Subscription plans are ridiculously expensive. There is no option to purchase the app out right. Now they have nerfed it down so the basic app is unusable and you can't add notes without a subscription. Thanks for ruining a great app. I will never do business with Evernote again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After around 8 years of using this app I hate to write this. It is clear that Evernote does not care about its users. They have hobbled their free version, basically rendering it useless. The premium version is absurdly overpriced as well. There are many other similar apps with far better free versions and premium subscriptions at a fraction of the price. I very much enjoyed the aesthetic of Evernote, but unfortunately it's time to find another app for my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Tries to force you to buy premium version by BOMBARDING you with ads, some of which you can't even close without clicking a link."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$5 a week 😂😂 It's a notes app. Other ones are maybe $10 a year. Greedy company to take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After last upgrade the app can't open!!! Please fix this problem I have to open my notes I have many works in it!! Do something faster"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My review from 2013 was ""Use it everyday on my pc, tablet and smartphone. I couldn't live without it."" and now, well, I'm just here to say thanks and goodbye. No warning of the notebook and note count changes on the free subscription, instantly locking me out from creating new notes right before an important meeting is just really uncool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for YEARS. Got worse & glitchy over time. Unreliable, then they became extremely forceful with pushing you to a paid premium version to the point of it being unusable. Would have paid IF it was half decent, & a respectful cost, but it's extortionate!! Moved to Microsoft One Note & not looked back. Only reason I didn't move sooner, was the hassle of migrating hundreds of notes & folders etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm done. No more. What a garbage experience. Didn't know about the one device new rule and opened on a tablet instead of my phone so I'm now locked out of my account and can't access notes. Switched to colour note which allows me to sync across devices using my Google account and is free. Greedy so and so's Evernote, I'm gone. Edit : deleted off all devices now. Good riddence."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"J'ai longtemps utilisé cette application, mais je ne supporte plus les incitations à chaque fois que je lance l'application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for many years. But lately, pop-up notifications to upgarde become very annoying. So annoying that, I am searching for alternative apps to Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for 11 years now its turned into money hungry machine. I'm a writer and I put most of my characters in this app because it WAS my favorite to use. Now I cant even get into those characters bios because it's only 50 per book and they make you pay for more books thus completely cutting out most of their loyal users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"WAS a good app. (Initiative / smart interface/good templates) I used it to store all of my notes / lists. Now very annoying to use because of constant bombardment of requests to upgrade. I would have considered paying a one time fee, but 100 euros a year to make to do lists?! I'm going back to pen and scrap paper and/or will use a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,":: This is getting ridiculous. Downgraded to 1* after finding out this morning that I'm only limited to 50 notes. I've been using this app for a decade, and already have well more than that note count. The subscription plans are too expensive. Even my cloud storage is cheaper than this plan. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"High plan rates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As others have said this app used to be awesome. I've used it for probably 10 years. Now, it is constantly showing ads and offers that it claims you'll never get again. It's almost unusable now. While I would consider paying for the app, the prices are insane and subscription only. The free version is so ad heavy it's impractical to use, the paid version is so expensive it's also impractical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app since 2014, but the constant notifications to upgrade to premium for $129 per year have forced me to start copying and pasting notes into another program. So far, I have lost 2 important notes because ""copy"" deletes the text. Even if I back out of the note (not clicking the checkmark to save), the text is gone. And here's the fun part: the text isn't on my clipboard either. I hate this program now! After I screen capture the rest of my notes, I'm deleting this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using Evernote for probably a decade but the new update just flat out sucks. Not fluid anymore. Slow. No user-friendly interface like it used to have. Whoever was in charge of this update really dropped the ball. I'll update my review to 5 stars if this is fixed, but I feel like it may have been on purpose for free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used 9 year and now end . 1.Bad UI 2.Force to premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like it. Premium is good. Best Digital Note taking application. Privacy friendly and fast-feature rich. Truly a blessing. Can't imagine a life in a digital world in this age of information without it. This is a must have application. I don't have any complaints so far. Liked it so much I have another subscription for work purpose. This one for personal use. Evernote is truly the best of the best. Certainly it is paid, but that makes it sustainable, reliable and trustworthy. Good Luck EN. 👍😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sketching doesn't work with my Samsung Note 10 stylus. Other apps have no problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be the best app on the market. Reliable and easy to use. A few years ago, they began to limit where and how you could access it. Then, they changed the interface to be less user-friendly, unless you paid for it. Now, they've limited the number of notes, won't allow you to access documents without bombarding you with purchase plans, and won't stop interrupting my typing with those purchase plans. Why would an app I've used free for 16 years, make me pay? And why would I now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy. I've had this since 2013, and it's just endless spam of ""Please pay me"". It's not even great at notes. I'll just find a new free one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"😡😤😠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't believe it's been 10 years since I started using Evernote. It's been a great tool for organizing my notes, projects, and ideas. But now, it's time to say goodbye. Evernote has changed a lot over the years, and not always for the better. It's become bloated, buggy, and expensive. I've found a better alternative that suits my needs and totally disappointed for their limited edition they are trying to make money not service..... Good bye :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used Evernote for years but now have had to change to a different app. It states 50 free pages, i had 39 and wouldn't let me have any more without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Gute App. Hat mich 4 Jahre begleitet. Aber: Als treuer Nutzer werde ich nun auf 50 Notes beschränkt und werde extrem mit Werbung für die Upgrade Version vollgespammt. Dadurch habe ich mich jetzt für Notion als Alternative entschieden. (Und ja, es dauerte SEHR lange, alles umzuziehen) Aber die Arbeit hat sich gelohnt. Danke Evernote für die gemeinsame Zeit👍🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I suddenly have to pay to make a few notes per year. Not fair."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app. And the app itself still works great. But they decided to throw up a pay wall. So if you have 50+ notes you can't make more unless you pay. And on top of that every other button you click now they hit you with a ad (do you want to pay and get premium ever note???) ....2 button clicks later....do you want to do a free trial that will auto sign you up to Evernote afterwards) Like chill bruh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"more than 7 years using Evernote and it was always 5 stars for me. But now they changed the simple easy to use layout to a complicated free-account-punishment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WAAAY Too expensive!! Better and cheaper alternatives.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since the day I changed to Android smartphone but things just get terrible and limitations are not logical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app over 10 years. Stored tons of notes. Went from free to exorbitant in cost virtually over night. 50 free notes? Nobody wants a note app with that limitation and frankly price way too high otherwise. Bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Installing updates all the time. Keeps spamming ""unique, never to be repeated offers/discounts"" . Sometimes I get the same ""if you cancel you won't get this offer again"" 3x a day. Recently the offers don't have a cancel option. You just have to accept and then cancel later or kill the app. Seriously, guys... stop offering free version all together. As for the paid version. Just not worth when compared with some of the alternatives 🤷"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"And now, it's USELESS!!! Cannot access my files!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"3 .99 per week is extortionate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently, app shows way too often annoying popup ads (even 2 consecutive + almost in each session + hard to dismiss, the X is unreachable)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible. Forces you to paid plan, does not work well. AVOID!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive used this app for years, but for the past while ive been bombarded every time i open the app or a note with premium purchase pop ups. Ive already found my replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I can not launch the app, how to fix it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"More than 10 years here, now you're just marely focused on revenue, bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10 years, only to have the app absolutely ruined by poor decisions. Invite growth is a moronic thing to chase. Nonstop ads, horrible ui, slow, buggy, and all around unusable. Now I am logged out every day and it won't let me log back in half the time. Uninstalling. AVOID THIS SCAM."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024 Update: You now have to pay to see your notes offline!! Useless! Deleted from phone. ****** It's extremely difficult to copy and paste into an Evernote text nkte. It won't do it at all unless there's at least an existing character in the note, and it won't bring up the Clipboard, limiting me to the last thing I copied. So off I go to a another app to paste, select all, delete, then back to Evernote. Also, I inadvertently deleted most of a note but couldn't find an Undo."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother. Used to be good and I've been using it for years but don't bother downloading, I'm moving to a new notes app because of the constant barrage of popups trying to make you pay an absurd amount to use a NOTES APP. They have made these pop ups worse and worse, and now you can no longer create new notes if you don't have a subscription. This company will surely go under at this rate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the free version for years. Lately they're relentless in their efforts to get me to pay money. It's getting really annoying. I'll have to move my notes somewhere else. Not interested in another subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Yup. Read the other reviews. It wants a subscription every time you open the app. Used to be the best app for note taking. Seriously thinking about uninstalling and finding another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It now cost too much for too little"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Shocking, disgraceful, a disaster. Used to be great, and then... God, where to start? Endless pop-ups to upgrade, just constant. Lots of sync issues and notes disappearing, constant bugs, crashes, duplicate notes. Horrible, slow, difficult interface. I understand that apps have to make money. There are ways to coax people into paying for a premium service. But if the free service is absolutely dreadful, why am I going to pay for the premium one? This app is going to die."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They lost my information! Precious works are lost forever now. Horrible, invasive and unreliable. I used and depended on evernote for years not knowing it was a trap. Evernote is ceaselessly interrupting my usage with popups pandering for cash. Every note I attempt to open is bombarded with them, and when I click them off they popup another one asking if I'm sure. Many many times a session. It's pathetic. If they offered once and gave a reasonable price.... And hadn't lost my work..then maybe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the most recent update, the app no longer works. I can't edit current or create new notes because it just pulls up a spinning gray circle. Trying to use the scratch pad just pulls up a notification that says ""syncing your content"" but it never loads. I've used this app for years without a single problem until this update. I'm unable to use any of the features, but they sure do want me to pay $15/mo for premium even though nothing is working. UGH. NOT HAPPENING."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app says you can have one notebook and 50 notes for free. Ive been using it for years, and have cut back to 24 notes, 1 note book and it STILL won't let me make any new notes without paying $15 a month, or purchasing a year subscription. Really chapping my a$s guys."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to have Evernote for years. You now have to pay to use this, and I can't even get my notes retrieved without paying. It is just dog s***. I would not advise anyone to download thing. Go get Google docs, one less thing to spend money on. 1 star rating for me.....and also you have a limit to 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I LOVE THIS APP. Yet I will only upgrade if yall come out with a life time option. Also the app doesn't need to ask me if I am going to upgrade every time I open it. Its harassing. I have to click I dont want to upgrade like 3 times before getting to the main page. 1.99 a week or 5.00 a month like Microsoft makes more since for the app price. That way it doesn't feel like your spending alot. Also a special price should of been for the people that have been members for year. Like me since 2014."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless now thanks to incessant pop ups. It's such a shame, this used to be a great app. But the pop ups pushing you to upgrade are so constant that it makes the whole process painful. If it were reasonably priced, i would actually consider paying for it, but $160 for a notes app is insanity. Find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"THIS APP IS A TRAP NOW... AT FIRST THEY WILL LET YOU PUT MANY NOTES AS YOU WANT, BUT LATER ON THEY WILL REQUIRE YOU TO UPGRADE YOUR ACCOUNT AND YOU CANNOT USE YOUR APP WELL IF YOU DON'T UPGRADE (WITH PAY) STOP DOING THAT EVERNOTE. YOUR PREMIUM IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO MINIMAL USER LIKE ME, ITS NOT A FRIENDLY PRICE TO BASIC USER LIKE ME. DON'T FORCE US TO PAY BIG. GIVE CONSIDERATION TO MINIMAL USER OF YOUR PLATFORM. LESSEN THE PRICE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Now has a limit of 50 notes in one notebook. For years it has been relied upon in a different way and without that it's usefulness has been drastically reduced. At the time of writing this it wants WAY too much money yearly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I 1st installed Evernote around 2005 and it was a great asset to have on my phone, Tablet and laptop. I primarily used it for business and kept it small and compact. However since about 2018 there has been a downward trend. Now the app has become virtually unusable with its constant prompts to 'upgrade' and to 'one notebook' rule. I have therefore copied all my notes into Joplin which is 'free-to-all and forever'."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do you wanna pay $129.99 per year? Today, July 21, 2023, the app opens to an utterly blank screen (no icons & no menus) on either of my device. LoL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was my go to app for taking down notes in middle of work... But after the latest upgrade it has become very frustrating... 1. The limit for free users has been set to 1 notebook and 50 notes. 2. Constant pop ups to upgrade 3. Very slow 4. Does not sync now with my other devices.. Time to say goodbye to Evernote.. will switch to onenote from Microsoft..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Big shame about the paywalling that's being done to Evernote rn. I've used Evernote since 2015 because I could use it for free for the basic feature of note taking and internet backup. Now there is a file limit per account before paying - which I'm already way over. Guess I'll be slowly migrating to another site. Shame pay subscriptions couldn't continue to be an Option for Evernote. Now you're basically forced to due to the small file limit. Rest in peace Evernote. Death by greed is always sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm having a lot of editing issues while trying to select and edit on my OnePlus 12 Android phone. It is editing more words and alphabets than those that are selected to edit. Can you please have this fixed and the app updated immediately??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest update killed this app on my tablet - Samsung S4. Every time I try to open a note, it just crashes. My MacBook and iPhone work fine. I tried restarting the tablet and even deleting and redownloading this app. I've never used their tech support, so hopefully they can help fix it. This is a warning to anyone with an older tablet. Super disappointing that this happened after being a subscriber for many years now. Please fix this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I tried Evernote because google keep doesn't have a good rich-text editor, which i need for complex task management. But unfortunately Evernote doesn't have single-note widget (like google keep)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, the upgrade to premium popup comes almost every other day and even the basic auto rotate option is still not fixed! Very annoying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used evernote for more than 14 to 15 years now. I used the free version. Of course, while I understand the company needs to generate revenue however the aggressive marketing approach to trying to get people on the free version to subscribe to paid version just comes across as needy, annoying, honestly it feels almost like a spam. I don't think this approach is effective instead it puts off the user and damages the brand. I am going to find an alternative and delete this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent for daily use and multi-tasking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I want my refund ! This poppin subscription is so annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy! It constantly asks me to upgrade to a paid version, and now I've apparently reached the limit of notes (50). Even after deleting several notes it won't let me add a new one. Then I remembered, we have Google Docs. Who needs Evernote. Uninstall. Bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth the trouble. The app works as a basic note pad but you have to go through multiple pages of upgrade offers every time you use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is ok but bloated and the company doesn't care about it's users. There's a reason why if you Google it there are mostly articles about the best replacement apps. They want to charge a high annual fee which includes AI and high amounts of data uploads. My monthly uploads are about 10mb because all I want is a reliable note app. So. Not worth the money. And they don't care at all about their customers of 14 years. Try something else!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They paywalled it and are limiting new notes and seem to think that this app is worth approximately 120 actual physical notebooks a year. Needless to say I will be either buying real notebooks or finding another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How hard is it to have the app not rotate if the device setting is set to Portrait!!! Even after multiple complaints from multiple users on various forums since April 2023, Evernote has chosen to ignore them. What an annoyance this is if one is lying down and wants to write a Note!!! No other option left but to switch to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have finally made payment via google play store and it has not reflected on my account. Evernote was my best app, but it seems to be competing with my worst app with this new approach it has taken."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many promotion ads. I won't use this app anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Charging high prices ! It was free and right now they are charging high prices when there are many other options on the market, I am going to uninstall it immediately, it is not worth it. Era gratis y ahorita ya están cobrando altos precios cuando hay muchas otras opciones en el mercado voy a desinstalarla de inmediato no vale la pena."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed. It's the way to the bottom. These guys want to charge more per month for a cute note app than services like XM that has satellites deployed in space and has to pay royalties. Check out Notion, it lets you import your Evernote content and move on. It's been a nice ride for over a decade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This use to be one of my favorite apps. Now it's usless. RIP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So many pop ups these days This app used to be my go-to and I was even paying for a subscription but my needs have gone down so I went away from the pay model. There is so much spam whenever I try and use the app now it's insane. I used to be able to open the app and get to what I want but now I have to close three windows trying to get me to upgrade. I get that the free model isn't paying their bills but it really feels like they're making an effort to push the free users out by inconvenience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, but the they decided to charge ridiculous prices and bombard you with ads. Over $100 a year for a note keeping app? What a joke. Google Keep is 100% free and it loads faster."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years and it used to be great until they changed it to be paid if I want more than 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using the free version of Evernote since at least 2015 when I wrote my first review for the app and gave it 4 stars. It is now virtually unusable. I use it primarily to write brief notes such as grocery lists and ideas that pop into my head so I don't forget them. Lately, every time I open the app I am besieged by incessant popups to upgrade to a $159 plan. It takes 5 or 6 clicks before I can edit a note. I'm looking for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for the yearly subscription almost 2 weeks ago. They are asking me to pay it again. I cannot create notes. When I try to create one they are redirecting me to the subscription renewal/renewal screen. If I choose to continue with subscription renewal I get an error that I have already a subscription. Great stuff 👍👍👍! I am using it since 2010. It's sad but it is what it is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"How's your day my brother...Uki pata kitu don't forget to send paperwork is going on thanks for your cooperation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Practically unusable now with the frequency of pop-ups, and limiting previously available features to their $160/yr paid subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went from a fantastic free app, to a 'free but with ad spam and no ability down downgrade notes easily to stay under their cap' I've spent a few hours pulling out all my notes from years of work to ultimately move to a new alternative. What a PITA."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly shoves subscriptions down your throat, and now they've even limited the amount of notes you can make without paying a ridiculous 100€ a year. Insanely annoying to use and super pushy and transparent. Used to be good but has become completely insufferable, on top of having a lot of bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edited from 5 stars to 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I understand nothing is free forever. But this has gone backwards. I'm currently exporting all my data. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used it for many years as free version. However now, as many others write already, you get bombarded with special offers and plans as soon as you navigate somewhere in the app. Moreover, it seems they downgraded the free version and limit the app to one notebook with 50 notes. A bit annyoing to copy all notes to another app but it's not really usable anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've downgraded the review to 1-star as the app on my mobile network does not load properly (4G). The app is untrustworthy for quick notes when you're away from a WiFi connection. Extremely glitchy app. Often doesn't respond and needs restarting. It also needs a fast entry facility as it takes too long to make a quick note. Syncing is good. Clicking on the new note button always leads to a blank screen the first time. You have to restart the app. Not good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've switched completely to UpNote after trying out about ten other note apps. I have used Evernote for over ten years and thousands of notes and have dealt with the cumbersome design changes and feature removals, but the latest exorbitant price hike was the final straw that pushed me to leave. The app is far too bloated, increasingly full of unnecessary features that make it difficult to access the actual note-taking functions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst note app now... so many issues. I have been using Evernote since 2011... they have become worse to worst app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"overall the app is good but they are charging really high for upgdration to newer version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was my go to note app for about 6 years but they don't like me using it for free and I don't like constantly being asked to upgrade. I did have VIP for a period before because I lost some of my note data due to their syncing issue, and they upgraded me as an apology. However, after that expired it would just keep pestering me. I finally moved my notes elsewhere because I just can't deal with this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to always come back to evernote. I've had notes stored about stories I've brainstormed or character ideas I've had in the past. Now because I had saved all of this info to evernote, there's no room for me to add anything else. It's a great app, but no way near worth over $130/year. It's not even worth that for a lifetime amount. So thanks for being great back in the day, but I'll start looking for another way to keep track of my writing endeavors."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Still a good app. Had to down a couple stars as the pop ups to upgrade are incessant even after saying you don't want to see them again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using the free version for 3 plus years, I decided to pay for extended stuff. One month later, all my notes completely disappeared, and I can only access them on my computer, not my phone, which was the whole point . I can find no person to help me with this, so I'm beyond frustrated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be an excellent productivity application. Now you have to pay mega bucks or you get only 50 notes (I already have hundreds)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The 50 note limit is unfortunately where I have to say no. For the price currently being offered for subscription, it's just not worth it. In a world with so many competitive alternatives that are equally good, you guys are literally throwing your customers away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now that I've finally paid for the service, it fails to open on my phone most of the time. I've reinstalled the app to no avail. It freezes at the login screen. Very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I started using it just last year and was liking it a lot, but since de update, because I had 3 notebooks, I simply can't do anything. I can't move the notes to delete the notebooks, I can't create new notes in existing notebooks, can't see the size of the notes, can't even **download** the notes... I won't be paying R$ 264,90 A YEAR to use a notes app like this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User since 2016, downgrading from a 5/5. I don't know what changed internally but at some point the decisions that started to be taken for this app made it worse and worse. The whole ""in your face"" premium ads are annoying. Having a limitation of only 50 notes is ridiculous for a notes app, as if people can't use unlimited notes in their stock notes app. Clicking on a setting in dark mode flashes a white screen, and the worst:AUTO ROTATE IS ALWAYS ON - NO MATTER IF YOU DISABLE IT IN THE PHONE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a member (both premium and free) for over 10 years. Now the new owners have decided to kill one of the best note apps there were. No ability to create new notes for those who have dozens of notes over the years. The constant lying ads about limited time offers each time you open the app and tap ANYTHING. What a shame, especially for users who've been here for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App opens by itself and tries to force you to upgrade to a $15 a month plan. This happens all the time when though I restricted data, background usage, and battery settings for the app. This is malicious!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Constant hard to close popups asking you to upgrade are _real_ annoying. Used to be a decent app, but I now only use it to access old notes I haven't migrated elsewhere yet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a paid customer since 2012. The price is now too high while inflation is killing the coneumer.I'm tired of nonstop warnings trying to get me to pay their highest price yet. I exported all of my notebooks to Joplin because there is no viable low-cost option and being hounded for not having a paid plan right now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now only on ONE device you can use this app. Too expensive for such app. I don't use those ""extra"" settings or futures. I don't use them. Why should I pay so much money just for adding some notes, and then open them on two devices? This is ridiculous! Uninstall this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. I've been using it for 10+ years!! It used to be awesome. Now there are literal CONSTANT pop-ups to upgrade. It's insane. The newest issue is that it won't let me create a new note because it says my max has been reached. The max is 50. I have 38...WELL under the maximum. I'll be finding a better app and deleting this one. Don't bother with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"always have complete access to any of you notes and files no matter what device you're using! Since reviewing back in September 2014 I had been using since October 2012. Today 2/5/2024 I transferred all my notes to Samsung notes and deleted this app. I'm tired of having to jump hurdles to use If you want me to pay, make it pay only, don't drive me crazy advertising every time I try to use it! Maybe make a scaled down free version and stop pestering me to upgrade! I don't need all those features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated app. App will not open. Now I have nothing. NOT GOOD. If I can't get to it, I have lost everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Overly limited, and grossly overpriced. Loads of free note apps out there, don't support this greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time user of this app. Unfortunately recently they have changed their ways with greed- limited my available space and are trying to charge ridiculous prices for more space or unlocking features.. time to move on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like everyone on here I had this app for 11 years and all of sudden wants to charge. I'm good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Waste of time money and energy. I refuse to sign up for a reaccuring bill on ""ORGANIZER"" when the parent company MICROSOFT WORD does this already."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pay! Pay! Pay! That's all this app is about. I remember losing my notes before in OneNote and I moved to use this for work and it's been awesome for years. Now I try to create a note on the free version and I'm blocked by a pay wall. 50 notes maximum and only one notepad. This is sad. I guess I'm going to have to move all of my notes back to OneNote. People think money is coming out of our ears here to pay 15 a month to take notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid for full version many years ago, got a prompt to update app and now saying I'm limited to just 50 notes. Outrageous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for more than 4 years. But after update this app has become garbage. Everytime there is a pop up for buying subscription.Its literally annoying. I haven't even completed 50 notes and they won't let me add a new. I migrated to Notion, It's much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened! Used to be the best. Now awful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free doesn't even give you what it says it will. Says 50 notes but stopped me at 35"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote - Notes Organizer app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible, so many ads that I can barely use it anymore. Already uninstalled and using a different note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Experience with me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's starting to annoy me with all the Ads to pay a subscription. I don't want to. I'm happy with what I have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Demanding too much money. I am switching to other free alternatives. This app gives Only one note book and 50 notes but I have more than 1 notebooks and its not letting me move notes from one notebook to another. Even for moving notes it requires money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"X2 price more than 60 dollars only for note book app with 56 notes of coocking recipes without any variation for price? Greedy. Will end using, was a client for 10 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I understand they need to make money, but the amount of ads, app crashes and how they continue to reduce what is included with the free account makes it almost unbearable. It use to be a go to app for note taking. Now I prefer anything else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"When we want to close app and press Back button in our mobile app is not going to back so we can not able to close app. Pls fix it in next update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best note app. But now an Unbearable amount of ads to upgrade, and not even close to being worth the price. It's an easily replaced app, and I've done just that. We had a good run Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last update informs me that now, with the free plan I have, I can only have one notebook and 50 notes. I currently have several notebooks and many more notes. I don't see the point on keep using this app, specially the free version. The two options I now have are 1) not creating any more notes, ever, or 2) paying 100€/year for something I used to pay nothing for. I'll be copying the content of my notes and migrating to some other app. I don't recommend it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years. The way it was years ago was much better then it is today. Quality and value seams to drop every time they issue an update. When I first started using it you could make all the notes you wanted, with the last update they have cut you to one note book and 50 notes with out any worning. I have 10 notebooks and nearly 1000 notes on this app from 8-10 years of use, now I can't use it at all because I am only aloud 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Love the app but the constant Ads lately to upgrade to the paid plan are getting a bit to much. The full price seems over greedy. I'm thinking of switching platforms."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing app but they have recently implemented a very aggresive subscription strategy with constant pop up promts telling you to get a paid plan. I get it but they're overdoing it so so so much! Considering switching to an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is still unusable due to the incessant pop-up ads. It's a notes app, I should be able to create a new note or open an old one without being prompted to pay $5/week. I'm glad I found a way to be able to export my old notes so I can move on, otherwise that would feel like extortion. There is a fair price for the service and acknowledge that no app that adds value should be free. But $250/yr is not that price. If it was $20/yr like a lot of apps these days I would pay it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable is the amount of spam ads trying to get me to subscribe. Every single day and time I open the app, 2 no 3 no 4 popups trying to force me to upgrade. Sometime they try to hide the close button or have a close timer. This came out of nowhere too, the app was usable before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved the app and used for 10+ years but after it's update, It went completely backward and don't let me create notes and notebook anymore because of the new limitation on the free plan. Big push on paying, bombarded with pop-ups, Evernote is not what It used to be. At this point, I'd say avoid this app unless you're willing to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the update, this app has been awful. Half the time it just doesn't load or it will after waiting about 5 minutes. Why update something that was decent to begin with? Now also just deletes notes and constantly crashes while always getting push notifications to purchase the Premium version. If the app was reliable, I would be happy to pay for the Premium option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After being an Evernote user since 2012 and recommending it to EVERYONE the benefits have slowly been removed over the years. I'm now getting warnings and popups saying that not only are we limited to just 1 device, we're now also limited to 50 notes unless we upgrade to a premium plan. A maximum of 50 notes means that this is no longer a tool to keep ALL your notes in 1 place. It no longer makes sense to keep this app at all. Very disappointing. No appreciation for original users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had been using the app since Nov 2017. Slowly the ads came up and with this latest update they are everywhere. You try to open an existing note, there's an ad. Quite irritating and thus making the move to another app. Thank you Evernote. And Goodbye..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really struggling lately, was always brilliant and useful, been using for years. Now changed phones to Samsung zfold and seems like it doesn't support it. Takes several attempts to just open it, then to keep it open is another tasks, items don't save on first try I have deleted and reinstalled a few times but issues still persist."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love evernote but lately the pop ups to buy premium and the limitations on free users are very annoying. The app is so slow and doesn't let me move my notes to different notebooks or even change the names of the notebooks. Sometimes it doesn't even load the notes. Terrible updates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*edit Two years later, updated the app, won't even open. Absolute garbage. Zero stars * original - from 2022 App won't even open. Years of work, gone atm. Freezes up when I try to open it. I hope this gets fixed because this is devastating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had evernote for nearly a decade. I have all sorts of notes there. Just the other day they changed it from free, to you can only have 50 different notes. I had over 100 notes already and now I can't create new notes without decreasing how many notes I have down to below 50. If I pay ~$130/year I'll gain the ability to create more notes. I'm sure they'll limit the characters per note next. Failed app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ist klug und neec"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's 2024 and I am being asked to pay a $14.99 subscription fee for a NOTE TAKING APP? Their plans used to involve how many devices could use the same account, if you wanted the same notes synced with your PC or other devices THAT'S when you needed to pay. Now we have to pay $14.99 if we go over 50 notes? I already hit the threshold. Evernote was my go-to, but with the 50 note limit and constant reminders to upgrade to the $139.99 yearly plan has me going to other apps. Farewell!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good free app. But out of nowhere, they decided to impose a bunch of limitations, like number of notes. I'm a writer. I make notes all the time. I'm so disappointed to have to leave the app after years using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love it, but performance has been getting worse and worse. Loads for a ridiculously long time and occasionally freezes. They added a ton of useless multimedia features, so it is almost unusable as a note taking app now. I guess they have discontinued support or something. Doesn't stop them from showing an annoying ad every time I start it, though. EDIT: Ads have become more common and stability has become even worse. Migrating to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've loved this app and considered it essential since 2011 -- now they have chosen to price gouge and dramatically limit the notes I can maintain in the free app. If the pricing were reasonable and i wasn't getting hit with 3 pop-ups everyone, I might've considered it - but there are too many alternatives and they greatly misjudged the market. So after 10+ years I will be parting ways."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go-to app to write down passwords, personal notes etc. While there was a paid version that offered more, the free version offered plenty for what I was looking for. Over the years more and more has been taken from the free version, to the point where I was no longer able to take notes because I was over the note limit (I had around 50 notes at the time). I'm now at 24 and still over the free limit. On top of constant pop-ups to pay for premium. This app is absurd now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Yuck"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this app from 2012 I think, such a bummer of what it become, cash begging to limitation of notes? Shame this will just results in more and more user leaving the app then of incitive to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I used it for 10 years, but recently the constant upgrade requests made it almost unusable. I would be willing to pay a bit to get the app back as it was, but the price they ask is way too expensive. I'm switching to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"What a mess. I can't get to my notes, & passwords. What good is it. It wants me to pay 150.00 but won't even take my credit card. I guit!#@@@!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You cannot do much anymore with the free version...they also implemented a game where you have to close upgrade ad 3 times to click somewhere in the app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it fine for years, and now suddenly I get nothing but pop ups telling me to spend over $120 a year to continue using it. Sometimes three in a row. It feels like I'm dealing with a virus site from 2004."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is now taking away features/capabilities from users. I've been a loyal user for around 10 years and now every time I open the app it says that I am now limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook. This was never the case before, and as a user for many years i have more than 50 notes. This is such a low class strategy and way of treating loyal users - to take things away and threaten people in order to have them upgrade rather than adding new value. Such bad business. I'm evaluating alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this for years for free & suddenly I can't even access any of my notes unless I pay? They are holding my notes that I have been using hostage because my limit is reached after this bs update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Asking to pay for basic features is just pure greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, now I have 1 notebook and 33 notes... tried to add one more note. There is no way - as I need to pay because I'm out of 50 notes... Well done, Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was okay until recently when they started to ask you to pay for pretty much even approaching the screen and buttons with your finger, and it's not even a reasonable price for what they give you. At this point, just make Evernote cost money to even download, and put all of the services there as readily available after you buy the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super but money hungry app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my go to note-taking app. I loved the organization and the customization of notes themselves, but over the years, features that used to be free (like creating more than 50 notes) are now hidden away behind a paywall and constant upgrade reminders. $160 CAD a year? I don't think so. I personally will not be paying almost the same amount as a Netflix subscription for a buggy note taking app when there are better free alternatives out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime I open it it ask me twice to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for upwards of 8 years and all of a sudden I can't create new notes because I have more than 50 and more than 1 notebook. I'm not going to go through and delete my old files just to use the app so this is it. All this update has done is push me to move elsewhere to a note app that doesn't limit its users to store files on their own devices. Also the popups pushing their subscription is now borderline intrusive. I'd rate 0 stars if I could as it's now unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go to notes app, but the free version has become essentially unusable. It has become frustratingly slow, the constant instrusive pop ups and demands to sign up to paid product are way too frequent, and have put me off the app altogether, especially at the excessive cost to upgrade. It's unfortunate that they ruined such a good thing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crashes after regular intervals. App corrupted my notes. Very bad experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now we have to pay this laggy app. So thank you, see ya later!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Way too expensive for the product and account upgrade banners are agressively pushy. Cheaper and more sensible to use notepad app on your device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be pretty good now only so many notes are allowed then you have to pay. You can't even open a note without being asked to upgrade every single time. Glitch with Samsung users makes existing notes slow to open. Would not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To many pop-ups for upgrade, to the stand i can't use anymore, everytime i open it to check a note i have couple of pop-ups. And upgrade option to expensive for the service offered, it it was one time fee i would considered it, but not with the yearly subscription. Migrated to another free alternative OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years to take notes and it was great. They updated their terms at the beginning of the year with no notice whatsoever saying that free users are now limited to 50 notes. Sad :(. Will find another note taking app because it isn't worth it to me to pay 100 something a year to take notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"come with bad experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot describe to you how annoying this app has become. It used to be good, now it's all UPGRADE UPGRADE and ARE YOU SURE ARE YOU SURE in your face. I wanted simplicity, I got annoyance. I actually dreaded needing to open the app for my notes. The number of how many you can have without UPGRADE UPGRADE UPGRADE being shoved in your face for ten popups isn't worth the aggravation any more, I'm finding a better app 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Congratulate your decision maker/ceo for Trashing Evernotes Reputation. *This was one of the last few good apps left that felt reliable & real, & you just trashed that! *Years Long Happy User, but suddenly notes are limited to 50. *I was trying to put down a new song idea quickly & you made me forget it with the suprise blocks & denial of service. I'm extracting notes from a few device accounts, I'm done with Evernote! Worried you could hold our notes for ransom, You lost all trust..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great but now constantly bothers me to upgrade to an overpriced version. And they purposely make it difficult to close out of these ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My daughter downloaded Evernote in 2013, and created a cookbook of our family recipes which she shared with me. Sweet, thoughtful and irreplaceable. They have tried to get us to upgrade to a paid version, but the free app has been perfect. Today I tried to add a note, only to be forced to upgrade the app before entering, and afterwards I was told my current plan only allows 50 notes and I cannot add until I upgrade to a paid version at $130 per year. Been 5 Star for 11 years, downgraded to 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great until they reduced the free version and tried to get everyone to pay. Now I can't get at my data, even though they say I ""should "" be able to view, edit, export, and share existing notes. Do not load / use! They can't keep their own promises."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asking too much money to create new notes. I don't like it anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App was great a year ago. Now buggy and FULL of ads that make the experience 10x less useful for notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They make you pay for everything now. I've used this app for YEARS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crashes all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app is very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is useful and I'm happy with it. But I'm very unhappy about the last limitation you introduced on number of notes. This changes dramatically the conditions I started to use Evernote a few years back and basically makes the free account useless , because 60 notes is very low. You should think about other ways to attract new rev. I will port everything on another similar platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote. Thank you for everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Seems I get an ad to upgrade on every single action in do and it is very annoying. Also, the subscription is pretty steep if you're only using core features of the app (note taking). Sadly, will need to look for more reasonable alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely annoying to use. UI is not user friendly. Hard to copy or move things out of the app. Constantly pushes for the subscription. just use Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have had this app for over a year now, constantly asking me to sign up for a paid application (which is super overpriced for what it does!!) and the notifications don't ever stop, every time I open it they are bombarding you. So much so that I have chosen to go with another note taking app, y'all should be considering the UX of your app & how it has the ability to drive away users!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's bad! Look, I get it: You'll need to earn money. But in a freemium model, you'll NEVER get everyone to pay. Now you're harassing people with pop-ups. The app is outright unusable. And guess what? Those people STILL won't pay. They didn't pay you when they liked the app, they won't pay you now, because you're ANNOYING them. All you achieve is driving your ratings into the ground. I certainly won't pay you now, out of sheer spite. Instead, I took the effort to give you this one star review"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From 4 to 1, pathetic action taken as I've been using it for like 6 years and for basic use it was good without paid plan but their recent updates and limiting each and every function has killed my use for app. I can't even use the notes and notebooks that I already had."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Perfect app but now you can't add any new notes if you dont pay. Verry expensive comparing to other note apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Obnoxious and invasive ads have recently ruined what was an otherwise marginally useable app. Those looking for a useful notetaking app might want to look to amplenote, or really any note taking app that doesn't disrespect their users with spammy splash pages and actually lets you use the basic functionality of making new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app (severly laggy n highly unreliable) by an anti consumer company. Shifted to Zoho Notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow really? 4.99 a week? Have you lost your minds? I always used this app ever since Samsung decided to do away with their built in notes app. 20 dollars a month times 12= 240 dollars a year just to write some grocery lists or reminders down? No thanks I'll use a pen and paper. Good bye Evernote uninstall forthcoming."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for over 10 years with hundreds of notes saved. Now I'm suddenly limited to 50 notes and can't create new ones, not to mention constant pop-ups asking me to subscribe. Think I'll uninstall instead 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"3 stars because I love what this app used to be, & can't bring myself to give it a review it's currents state deserves. I understand the need to make money, but restricting it all the way to only ONE notebook for the free version feels insane to me. I used this app for everything. My books, world building, personal journals. I LOVED this app, but I can't bring myself to use it anymore. I deleted everything [after transferring it all to a different program]. I had no choice but to leave... RIP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant ads BEGGING you to upgrade to the paid version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They ruined a great app. Slow, bad UI, unreliable sync, and many more issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote as my primary note-taking software since 2009. What's happened to it in the past couple of years, and with this final decision pulling the rug from under its loyal users, is nothing short of a masterclass on how to ruin a great product fast. It used to be that it had no competitors, now there are far better options out there. Still a damn shame to see one of my favorite apps go out like that. It deserved better. Shame on the new owner for ruining it irreversibly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for over ten years, but it is becoming unusable. As a lyricist, i need to be able to quickly write down ideas that i can access from other devices later. Recently, the app had been missing the last few things I write! I can't think of another app that has got steadily worse over time! Looking for a replacement. Edit: Even worse than before. Apparently I've hit my 50 note limit. Well, you know what? I'm now looking for another service i can transfer to. You've lost me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nice cash grab limiting users who have been using it for years to 50 notes, great move guys, will promptly move all of my notes to a different app! Thank you again!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Despite updating the app, I am no longer able to add notes even though I only have half of the 50 notes allotted to the free version. This app was already quite annoying with its push to paid app and its exorbitantly expensive, $180/year for a notes app is ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asked 4 times to upgrade to premium before i started using it. Not worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant ads and being forced to upgrade for more notes. Good app ruined by greed. Will be using a different app and uninstalling like most other users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too many Pop Ups! The free app will ask you constantly to upgrade and it glitches often. I have tolerated the app since at least 2018 and thought it was OK. I only kept it because I didn't feel like transferring everything to a different app. But today, it popped up 3 times in 2 minutes asking to upgrade. That was the end for me and the end for Evernote on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Made the mistake of upgrading to Personal subscription. Now I cannot access my notes because it says it does not support my Chrome browser. Used Chrome on my phone for years with the free app with no problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I expected this app to be simple & feature rich. I'm the type of guy who like simplicity & especially writing notes is meant to be simple. I was using Google Keep & was very dissatisfied with how little formatting features it had, so I downloaded this app expecting a simple & feature packed experience but unfortunately this app was not simple or clean looking at all! I switched back to Google Keep again & luckily they've added some formatting feathers while keeping the simple look too!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for over 14 years. First it limited the number of devices, now you must subscribe or they won't communicate with you. I don't remember if I had paid anything when I got the app but it sure isn't worth subscribing to use it. I'm looking elsewhere. They won't reply to unpaid users. Why penalize long-term users like this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was good for notes now too many ads that won't go away so very annoying to try attempt to get notes down"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Way too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the app/program since 2013 but for the last month the app keeps crashing forcing me to go to my settings and force stop the app. it's been happening on a daily basis. Need some technical support"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this compant is dying of hunger. Wrote notes here for my whole life now I can't even open the app anymore without having do dismiss 5 notifications. Ridicolous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rating over 4 must be fake. The new owners (Bending Spoons) had a goal to trash this company to the ground."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my review that I made in 2015 from 5 to 1 star. I have a few big issues with it. EVERY single time I open it it's begging me to pay for the yearly subscription and it takes multiple back button presses to exit the subscription plans. Whenever I click on a note, or move from one to another, it opens up MORE pop-ups telling me to pay $100 for a yearly subscription. (BuT wAiT! iT's A lIMiTeD tImE oFfER! It's so annoying and unusable. I'm looking for a better app now. This one sucks bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for a long time, but now they are limiting the free version to 50 notes only, meaning I will be moving to a different app. I would have paid a one time fee if it was an option, but I only get 'exclisive one time offers' or 'limited time offers' all the time, which is trying to pray on the Fomo of the user/customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basically unusable due to ad spam unless you pay. Who pays for a notes app lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have to see good bye now. Not useable at all now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'd been a loyal Evernote user since 2016 but since December I am now bombarded by continuous ads to get me to subscribe and have been limited to only 50 notes which I already had a few hundred, I haven't been able to live without Evernote but now I'll be looking for an alternative as the developers have become money hungry pigs wanting to charge fees to use something that we use to use for free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for close to 10 years now, and never had any issues with it. Now it is HORRIFIC how often it gives me popups to upgrade to a premium plan. It used to be every few months I'd get a popup when opening the app which I just had to dismiss. Now every time I open a note, I get multiple pop-ups with very hard to find close/pass on this offer buttons. I'm copying all my notes to another app and deleting this one because im getting more popups than Raid Shadow Legends had"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Money hungry corporations. But I think it's a great great app for ANYONE who need to take detailed specific notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive. I've been using Evernote since 2013 and I'm happy that I found a better and free alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable. I guess after the owners made a few million each, the focus turned into maintenance those millions each year. Regardless of the well-being of the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to Notes app but in recent years, especially with the latest updates, it's glitchy as hell, not as seamless and the interface is wonky and clunky. It's a chore to do anything on the app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No care or regard for long-term users. Have been using this app since 2018 and never needed anything else. The new limits have made the app unusable for long-term users, and to charge £79.99 per year is EXTORTIONATE! Avoid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a member for years and now can't sign in to my account. And no help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible terrible terrible. Do not download. This is bs. Evernote automatically connected a third device to my account. I tried to disconnect it 3 times. Now they are locking me out of my account. EVEN THOUGH I NEVER CONNECTED THE DEVICE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over a decade and used to love it. But lately I'm seeing more restrictions on the free version and the app constantly begging me to pay. It shows more pop ups than a porn site. Moving on. So long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app since 2013. I really liked it in the past because of a good search within the app. I have always used a free version of it. The last couple of years they have been pushing more and more towards the paid version of the app. Every time I open the app it asks to switch and pay. I do not find that the app is much better than in the past. Maybe slower! So annoying!!!! I started using Google Notes these days."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too expensive...love it used it and now zi loose all my important stuff cause they see a chance to make money..so sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2016. Evernote started as a wonderful service & devolved into greed like every other app. They now want to charge you a ton for being a basic note creator & organizer app, which you can get from open-source apps for FREE. Good news, you can turn your back quickly and easily on Evernote and switch to Joplin for FREE- export your notebooks and switch to less greed-centric apps. There's always better for cheaper. Good riddance, Evernote. Never looking back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good app but you know that the app has some bug and you guys never fix it, and now you make it paid?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: 1 star now. They've killed the free version completely. ---- To Do lists are broken. Always deletes text as I'm writing then appends to th end of the re-written text the letters that it had deleted. Very frustrating. Evernotes is good for taking notes (not To Do lists)...And that's about it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good, but now it just has so many ads for its premium membership, and you can't do much with the very expensive premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is evil. I am user since 2009, Recently it made changes into user plans and won't let use the App beyond 50 notes, until i purchase high subscription. Hence deleting the app. There are better alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great place to organize my notes, with minor inconveniences for the non-premium users like me. I didn't even mind the barrage of ads to subscribe to their premium services. However, with the recent changes to push people towards premium plans, such as not being able to CREATE NEW NOTES, it has become impossible to use this without a premium subscription. I cannot reccomend this to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use Notion instead. Evernote changed the free version's offerings and broke my account in a way that I was unable to use it anymore. I couldn't make new notes because I had too many notebooks, but they removed the ability to move notes because I was now over the limit (also I wasn't notified of these changes). So I couldn't move my notes into one notebook without copy/pasting outside of Evernote. Use Notion instead, Evernote is dead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2015, had 5 stars review but changing it to 1. i've had 1000+ notes in it and suddenly can't use them because it pops up adds and makes me to buy the app. $15 per month is a JOKE! 1 star from now from me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Window keeps on popping up to ask me to subscribe to a paid plan. Are you trying to push all your users to paying for your service. If so just send out a message to say we will be charging you and we will just port out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money >>> notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great experience overall. I love taking notes when you can make them organized & easy to understand! GoodNotes has many different pen/pencil/highlighter options that make it fun & aesthetically pleasing to take notes, keep a planner, or keep track of documents."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just want to be able to write stuff down on my phone. I cant look at my notes without closing 4 ads first. Im switching to pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote. Then it got really buggy. And now, it's still so buggy that I have to close and reopen every time I open it. It also asks me to buy it at a REDICULOUS price EVERY time I try to open a note. Super limited, can't create a new note without buying it. It's a shame companies can't be satisfied to let the public have a great app for a great price. Always greedy for more and giving the public less. Going to switch to a new app until they do the same thing and I have to again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From what used to be a decent notes app, the experience has gotten worse and worse in time to the extent that I am being polluted with ads and forced to pay for text. Friendly advice: just get Notion. It's better in every way and FREE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"needs to pay subscription to access my old note, how low can you go?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit isn't smart. It should be a place where you can make notes without having too many pop ups and limits."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i love that it works across multiple devices so my partner and i can share shopping and to do lists. plus the easy ability to format is a big plus"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A once useful app Evernote became unusable trash with constant messages pestering me to take out a plan. I increased my productivity by deleting Evernote from my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over priced and they limit the amount of notes you can have. $130 a year is insane"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Would be better, but now that theres the payment plan for more than 50 notes? I like it as a note app, but i do plan on finding something else, because when i first used evernote, there was no limit. You didnt have to pay, but you could."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get app to fully display on Android phone so I can agree new terms, etc.; so am unable to see my evernotes on my phone. Please fix!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had given this application 5 stars in 2013 but now deserves only 1, by the time Evernote gets worse by forcing you to have to buy it, can't enter through web browser easily and much more. Now literally I hate it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of dirty marketing is insane."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sellouts. Sign away rights to class action lawsuit or stop using app by February. Not free anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's ok, has a few glitches here and there in the free app but it's to be expected I guess? Recently though, you can't go anywhere near the app without it insisting you pay for the premium version. Every time you open the app or a note, 'are you suuuuure you don't wanna upgrade?'. NO, I don't want to upgrade, go away. But you have to click it twice, everytime. Finnaly had it and got a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for over a decade and now it's starting to just delete my notes. Delete years of work, years. I will try and copy something and it will just delete it, without any way to recover. Awful. Would not recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it. SO tired of having to find my way around upgrade ad EVERY time I open app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very useful..use it every day amd have beem isomg ot dfpr years! Have reduced the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars as the newer version keeps crashing when trying to share web pages"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to LOVE Evernote, that was until they starting taking everything away unless you pay a large yearly fee, I can't even get my notes offline now. It's ridiculous and I like not to be forced to pay so I can get them and move on. I understand everyone has responsibilities and bills to pay. Realistically, in the big scheme of it all, it's simply about how much profit one can make. It's not just Evernote... it's everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has gone so consistently downhill over the past few years it's extremely disappointing. From an app I would recommend to anyone to something I would discourage anyone from going near. To make it so unusable when free, with such a steep premium fee, for such a mediocre paid product? What a bizarre business path for them to choose"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used this app for 10 years and really enjoyed it. Just used the free version, never felt that I needed any of the premium features, especially as they kept raising the price. Then recently they put a limit on how many notes you can create using the free version, with the max being 50...after I had already created over 1000. Might have considered paying to remove that limit if it was like $5 (Canadian) a month, but it's $18. Switched to Joplin and now pay $4.50 a month for exactly that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open the app up without advertisement to upgrade. Getting sick of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app saved all my 5 to 6 year datas file pdf thank you so much we want to recommend and receive your new updates fast like beta alpha version if you have"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"bombarded with subscription requests. I probably have to consider transferring my notes elsewhere to save myself from the incessant attempts to make me sign up. It used to be amazingly convenient"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Remember when there were no ads? Pepperidge Farms remembers. Literally an ad every time I open a note. Will be switching soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They spam you with ads unless you sign up for their paid platform and it makes it very difficult to use this app because of that. Pick a different app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free plans allow up to 50 notes in one notebook. I have 35 and can't add another note because I have to ""upgrade"" Guess I'll be moving somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"All ways fantastic to communicate with everyone around the world. Congratulations"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I open this app, it asks if I want to upgrade to the paid version. Every time I say no, it says it's a one time only offer and I won't be able to get it back if I decline. What a load of rubbish! The same or similar offers pop up every single time I use the app, without fail! This has been going on for months. The phrase ""you won't be able to get this offer back"" not only means nothing but is an outright lie!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hope no one will ever use it. I'm so furious with new restrictions!!! I've been using Evernote for ages. It ends now. I will make my peace with moving all my notes and even with paying for another app. It still will be more fair than what these morons did."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cheating app... i paid twice by mistake still it shows upgrade..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be fine and free. Not they're trying to muscle you into a plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I can't launch Evernote anymore. It was working well until Jan 22. I am not able to accept the new policies therw is no CONTINUE botton to click on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"100 bucks for note taking per year crazy. This was my goto note app before not now Any more. I cannot add anymore notes even it is not to the limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome app with security , Thank you Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Editing my new 5⭐ review to 1⭐. With new update, there is constant pain for it's high price membership. New notes adding is painful.. also reading my old notes is headache. Looking for it's alternative. I was using it from 2015"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I keep downgrading my review. I've been a 10+ year user of this app. Started at 5 stars, then 4 when buggy, then 2 when they stripped the free version of features, now 1 star because they bug the sh!+ out of me to upgrade with EVERY SINGLE CLICK!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do you love closing three pop-up that beg you to upgrade to the paid version every time you open a ""free"" app? Then this is the notes app for you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since forever, but now it's ridiculous with the pop-ups and the outrageous pricing. I'm almost done saving all my notes, after that I'm out."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 11 years I am finally Evernote Free!!! 🥳 The app was getting worse and worse over the years, but the last limitations introduced by the new owner were the last nail in the coffin. The migration was stressful as there are too many apps out there and there's no universal substitute as different people have different needs. But now I'm happily paying £0.89 per MONTH for the replacement and good Evernote screwed everything, because the change is so refreshing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After switching to Electron, Evernote has become slow. Recent price hikes have been too unreasonable. I have switched to UpNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since I was 28 and this year at 40 I made the decision to transfer all of my notes and closed it due to ridiculously annoying multiple attempts to ask me upgrade and was almost designed to accidentally pay to use. Few days ago I realized it locked the ability to add more notes if I want to remain a free user. Thank God I have no more than 40 ""notes"" in all these 12 years. It felt good to say goodbye once and for all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is a very good app to use for taking note of important and writing i have in mind very useful for any situation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"artificial limit of 50 notes has been introduced and put behind a paywall – the ads for which are more intrusive than any mobile game i've ever played will be moving all my notes elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too many ads always trying to get me to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't open notes to create one. It just is a blank screen, even after force closing it and clearing cache. And I'm not over my limit either... It's just not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"was about to use Evernote again. but nah. when the app keep asking me if I want the upgrade, I was like nah, I'll never use this app ever again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whatever you did during a recent update and not allowing this to be a free app is very disappointing. I see multiple entries of the same note and am missing many notes I have entered previously. Your subscription price is way too high. I can no longer recommend this app to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Yet a menu layout option for categorising list names and numbers in alphanumeric codes as an option on the menu tab for us all would be great in the future. please consider this if possible please. Thank you for your time and consideration and care. JK Gibson"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for 13 years and slowly over time they took away features until now I go to add a note and it says ""you can only have up to 50 notes and 1 notebook for free, you have to pay $159/yr to add more"". $159 per year?!?! I have 200+ notes and 10+ notebooks! You've made the app effectively useless! Buying pen and paper is cheaper than your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 star for charging a $130/year subscription for a basic note-taking software."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Terrible UI that works against widespread ""industry standard"" behaviors."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a brilliant app. Have used Evernote for around 13 years and has always been great for me. Free version was fine for what I needed. Then suddenly without warning they limited the free version to 50 notes and I get constant pop ups with a ""special offer"". I can still access and edit current notes but that's it. I'm not against moving to a paid tier but price is too high."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app until you wanted money and I would get spammed, every time I opened the app, with ""discounted"" offers...and now my notes are limited to 150 and 1 book (but actually I have over 400+ notes created from before you guys tried to monetize this app. 😢 I will be using a different app to take notes now. It was great while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years and suddenly it won't let me create notes. It says I can only have one notebook and 50 notes, but when I tried editing an existing note, It wouldn't even let me do that. I understand ads and things to pay for the work developers do on apps, but Evernote has just become too difficult to use... Especially when there are plenty of free competing apps. After researching free replacement apps, I'm finding Microsoft OneNote to be a very close replacement. Give it a try!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was great, now it's overly monetized and full of pop-ups and new restrictions for free users. I'm moving on to OneNote after over a decade of use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be a nice and easy App. Now the free version is basically useless. You can't create more than 50 notes, the app is loading super slow and to access the notes you have to close multiple push up adds for the premium plan before. Also in my eyes the price for the premium plan is insane if you just seek for an app to safe simple text files."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"using the free version and it has hard limits on how many notes I can have, even if I delete some it doesn't give me room to create more. I didn't know this beforehand and ended up creating and deleting several notes and now I only have access to like 6 out of around 25. The ads are aggressive now too, I get ads for the premium version every single time I click on anything. Use a different app, this one is just annoying I'm moving away from it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot decrypt notes on Androidsibce Aug 2023. I keep trying every upgrade and even bought the personal plan after the free plan said no more than 50 notes and hoping the paid version might fix my issue. I hasn't. I have been a user since 2011 and highly recommended it. But now it is unusable on my phone for what I need it most for. I will not be renewing my subscription if it isn't fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Can you stop giving me pop-ups every time I open the app, offering a membership? I've been ready to hit the X and say ""I'm sure"" but now you've come up with a puzzling way for me to X out. Now I have to slide the offer down. Just stop! I love the app, just hate doing this every single time I open the app to find my notes! Also, app crashes when I try to customize the Home."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been using evernote since forever, but they lowered the limit for free and now forces me to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps force closing when I tap the home button"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"STOP. ASKING. ME. TO. UPGRADE! I say again- STOP ASKING ME TO UPGRADE! I don't want to upgrade, I have no need for it, especially not at the outrageous price they're asking. Evernote used to be free, but now they're incessantly harassing their users to upgrade. I'm going to move to another app if it doesn't finally stop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"👌🏾"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I bought an annual subscription thinking I could link my Outlook calendar but I can't, I requested a refund the day after and Google rejected my request. What? Is this happening?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app (free) and recommended to everyone. Now it's just a hassle to do anything, struggling to find things, cause ads keep popping up, can't customise home screen to a simple layout etc etc Looking for a new app Now just found I can't add another note or notebook? Why don't they rather just say 'Your free account will be deleted shortly'? Be upfront and put the limitations on the app store description"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I got Evernote back in somewhere around 2017 I think for the ability to organize my life. I used to make so many notebooks and unlimited notes. It was amazing because there was FINALLY a free note taking app that I DIDN'T have to pay an arm an a leg for. This app helped me organize my ADHD into something I can work with. Now everything is ruined. Not only are there constant subscription ads, I now can only have one notebook and 50 notes. Not worth having this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be one of my fave apps. I only use it to catalog my craft supplies so I know what I have/need and don't buy dupes. Also, I could sync it on my phone/PC. However, now everything is limited how I may use it. I can't even add or move a note without paying $12.99/mo. Excuse me? I think not. I'm a very smalltime user. lol I'm literally using 442bytes of 60mb! There are many optional apps avail. now so I think I will find one that values my loyalty and recommendations - user since 2015!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The greed of developers has broken all records."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Much like all of the other recent reviews of Evernote, my experience is almost identical. I have been using this app since 2011. Now I cannot even open the app without advertisements asking for me to purchase the monthly or annual subscription. And the cost is entirely too high for what they are offering. I have been a loyal Evernote customer and I would have paid a reasonable price for the subscription service, but the prices they offer are nowhere near reasonable. Use Google Keep Note instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has become such a pain in my neck kind of a app especially with auto rotation feature which comes by default and you can't turn it off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updating my old review. I've been using Evernote since about 2011. Now the pop up to upgrade is so excessive, matching the excessive price TO upgrade, and I can no longer create new notes. Incredibly frustrated and will be finding a new app. Here's to the hours it will take me transferring my old notes so I don't lose them..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Actively getting rid of loyal users I first started using Evernote in 2008, and found it so useful for recording a daily journal in addition to other notes that I subscribed to the premium version. But in The last 5 years the price has tripled while support has tanked and ownership changed several times. There are many better alternatives, stay away from this one!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Could have been great, but it's now riddled with ads and carries a hefty price tag to remove said ads. $4.99/week or $169.99/year, yeah no thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"While initially this was my go-to app for taking and making fast notes at work and accessing them on PC, the constant ads and pressure for me to upgrade to their subscription ($160 a year??) are driving me away from it. In addition, while I am still using their free version, I only have 35 notes on my device... but it says my limit of 50 has been reached and won't allow me to create a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very aggrating app. Have used it for 5 plus years. I've always had the paid version, at least as long as they have been charging for the app. I upgraded again in Dec of 2023 and still no upgrade, deleted, or held hostage notes, and still do not have access to the ""upgrade"". When you get try to work with support you just get routed back to a bot no matter the path you take. I'm stuck. I have years of business and personal notes tied up up. I want to leave this service but no way to export notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Feelgood and faster! I really like the app after new update pleasedon'tchange nothing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Oh boy Evernote update often and forced us to pay monthly that not right bec for free Evernote with 50 limited that all. Evernote love to bother mobile for update to pull costs $$$$$ too much. Many people think Evernote try to advantage them to pay attention pay cost! I will remove Evernote app today. I am very disappointed about my lists in there bec of Evernote blocked my lists in my mobile. Rating is 0! I read many reviews that many people not happy with Evernote app. Sorry!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this for random small notes, nothing crazy. But I spend more time X the pop ups for a $4.99 weekly subscription, it makes this app not worth the trouble."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was hoping to get an exciting app for my assignment to journalise, but the future looks bleak because the download wont complete"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"You used to be my best, and I have to recommend you to almost everyone that came my way looking for alternative note or documents keeper. But lately your service is currently not funny and this is an honest opinion. With my years of experience in SEO, I will humble request you do some more work on your UI/UX to look more pleasing and simple to navigate. This is to enable This will promote more conversation and authority. Cheers!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite note app, but now it randomly shuts when I open it, won't let me type, deletes some of my tasks as I am adding another one, jumbles my words, and recently has taken to duplicating my notes to the point I have 7 of the same note. It has become increasingly annoying and I am deleting it. Edit: I tried keeping it a bit longer as I've had it since 2016. I'm actually deleting it now because it won't let me create a new note despite being way below the limit of 50 (20)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since a few months ago it's becoming increasingly impossible to work with this app without getting bombarded by reminders to upgrade to paid version. After 10years of being a user, I have to uninstall it. Unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"deleting this app, it use to be good but now I get asked to upgrade every time I open the app. 120$ per year is ridiculous for a note app. out of touch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"an excellent app for keeping imp data in cloud storage. Easy to retrieve through mail id."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The free version has almost been unusable for the past few years with the amount of ads they serve trying to get you to upgrade. It's a shame they can't have a basic free model of this otherwise solid product. I've changed to a different, better, cheaper notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"wao"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 8 years I´ll switch to google keep. I´ll not pay a subscription for more than 50 notes. You will lose a lot of users with this new greety policy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't sweat the small stuff in life, except now I am truly irritable whenever I use this app, I don't even want to open it! It just ALWAYS, ALWAYS would have their UPGRADE AD pop up. I already declined and yet they have to ask OVER AND OVER AGAIN it's almost unusable at this point!😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"medium Y"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"DIVINE GREETINGS FROM KISHOR BHAI THAKRAR IN DAR ES SALAAM TANZANIA I AM VERY PLEASED & HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOUR GUIDANCE & INSTRUCTIONS (INFORMATION ).VERY NICE OF YOU"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible sometimes and average most of the times.. I have been a paid user for last 7 years and this app is getting worse. On my iPad, it crashes a lot and the moment i switch to a different app, the note reloads itself from the start. Overall pathetic ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent application & performance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good. Now it's garbage. It won't let me make a new note. Says I have to subscribe in order to have more than 50 notes, and I have lest than 50. It also won't load any of my pics I have in specific notes I made. Total garage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive for what it is. 169$ just to customize the home screen..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucks, I used to love it, and then they more than doubled the price. And took working features away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now plagued with constant pop-ups to try and get you to upgrade. Don't bother."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The user experience has meaningfully declined to a point that I am in the process of leaving this service. Better options than Evernote are now PLENTIFUL!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use it years ago. Came to leave 1 star. Limits the # of devices that can access your notes to 2 devices. Even if you log in with a web browser. They also have horrible security as someone got my PW and logged into my account but thankfully couldn't get passed 2FA. They tried many times. Really wanted to leave an extra 1 star to lower their rating so people know not to use them. I use google keep now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly pop ups asking you to subscribe and getting worse, if things don't change I'll be looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use this app since 2015.It used to be an awesome app. Helped me to keep recipes, notes, novels and other stuff. But thing is. As free user I can no longer create anything new, since free users can't have more than 50 notes and 1 notebook. In 9 years I definitely have more. Pay? Why would I pay subscription more expensive than Netflix if I need to write one or two notes per month. Sometimes I don't even use the app. So yeah 1 star...even though you don't deserve even that greedy villains"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wonderful app before the ""premium"" update. Now unusable wit limited notes, constant pop-ups,etc. I don't even have the limited amount of notes and still get a message saying I'm over the limit allowed!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Almost every time I open the app to take a note I get an ad trying to sell me the premium version. It's very intrusive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for upgrade a month ago. Evernote took my money. Zero upgrade zero benefit. Also checked in the app, no contact email to fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. Been using it for many, many years. Now they've capped my entries and I can no longer create notes unless I upgrade for like $150. I can barely access the ones I've already created without being bombarding with upgrade ads every few seconds. Wth?! Jumping ship and transferring my notes out of Evernote right now. Will be deleting this app afterwards... It's a terrible shame. Smh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a handy free notepad app. Unfortunately, now, every time you open it you have to close out several ""UPGRADE TO THE PAID VERSION!!!"" pop-ups just to use it. I'm currently searching for something better and will edit this review to inform folks of a replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad application now!!! Developers totally destroyed their product!!! Now is terrible, it impossible to use normal without payment!!! 1 star is to much for Evernote 2024!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Hi there,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is too slow and ux is awful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have no idea"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be such a great app, I've been using it for 10+ years but now it's just pop up ads left and right trying to get me to pay for the subscriptions and I can't even use the app anymore because of all the pop up ads (that of course say ""are you sure you don't want this offee? It'll never be offered again!"" 🙄). Plus the search function is broken and won't pull up notes I know exist, so I can't find anything anymore either. It's useless now. So frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can't believe they made it totally premium and now after using it all these years I have to look for alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Just really started getting to use Evernote. It is becoming more useful every day as I get better at using it. I have the Premium version and I reckon this will be worth it from the satisfaction I get having a good personal ""database"". I can completely organise my life now. 🇬🇧"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my favorite note app of all times. I used it for years. Have written a lot of valuable notes in it BUT the constant and very annoying suggestions to upgrade it to a payed version forced me to abandon it for another note app that may not be better featurewise but at least it does not annoy me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was an awesome app for YEARS. I have all my important things saved here from years. Now it says evernote doesn't support my browser and I can't get to my saved information which leaves me helpless. I haven't changed my browser so what are you talking about?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get back in to retrieve everything I've saved here! It seems now not free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"1st time I used this I dont know if its good or very good let me see.,for now it was awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for nearly 10 years and they've decided they no longer want anyone whose not paying $160AUD PER YEAR to be able to functionally use their service. I had all my notes on evernote but I'm apparently no longer allowed to make new ones without paying. I'm moving all my notes off and deleting my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They limited note creating. Seriously!!! Limited facilities would be fine. But now they wouldn't even let me take a text note. Don't waste time. Don't install it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nasty, nasty business with a nasty business model. Tricked us all into believeing that this app would store our notes forever. But increasingly we are bombarded with distracting and time-wasting nag screens which bully us towards spending the insane sum (for non-commercial users) of £80 per year. You're much safer using OneNote for free and without any nagging."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a way to absolutely tank your app. I cannot describe how horrible the current experience is. Have moved to a different app now after using for years and years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My account has no notebooks or notes on it and I haven't used it in over a year, but I can't create a single note without coughing up over $130. The old useful note software I used in college is now just paywalled drek."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but has become steadily worse and more annoying to use over time until it's almost unusable. Finally moved all my info to a different app and deleted this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The usability and look of the app are great, however it does constantly pushes it's paid plans on you, which has pushed me away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I like this app but there is to many pop ups with information to upgrade to paid version- it is very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have loved Evernote for a long time, but I can not recommend this app in good faith. I've been a user since 2013. The user experience has been eroding for the last few years. Today I opened the app to discover I no longer get to use it unless I pay an extremely unreasonable fee of $200 annually. I'd gladly part with a one time fee of $60 for this thing, but $200 a year is a bitter pill to swallow. It's a sad day but they have finally pushed me out. Goodbye Evernote. It's been nice knowing you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"For anyone who is having trouble clicking through the new service agreement. This is the fix that worked for me.. I went to my settings and made my screen font size smaller so the full page would fit on the screen. I'm hopeful you'll find this helpful. Cheers Richard"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't have anymore access to add more notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have always loved this app, but now you're putting messages & you can't get rid of them to get to the app. They are too large & you can't scroll to where you say there is a continue button so now I am SOL at the grocery store trying to find my list. 😤🤦‍♀️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years (used to be top rated) but in the recent years it became very buggy. Sometimes it doesn't save notes properly so you come back and you have multiple versions of a similar note. Sometimes notes don't open so you have to reload the app. The search function is subpar, you have to search notebooks, then the note itself, and still scroll to find. The layout has changed to cater to paid versions, there is a limit to notes now, and constant spam to upgrade to paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This all has turned into unusable garbage. It won't let me scroll to accept the newest garbage terms on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App frozen on updated terms page and won't scroll down to accept terms. Therefore app won't open!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just 1 Notebook and 50 notes? And if I need more I have to pay?? Sorry but no, so this is me quitting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used Evernote for over ten years and absolutely loved the product, enough to evangelise it to people. I'm now switching out due to the incessant reminders to go pro - it's a terrible user experience; if the goal is to reduce server costs from non premium customers, well done. I can't recall a product that got so bad so quickly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"A lot of really bad issues were fixed after a long period what made me practically stop using it. Now the app is back to its known good performance. There is still a issue with the website links on the desktop version, but generally it is still the best note app in the market."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this for 10 years and now I can't sign in at all on my phone, keeps saying error and to try again. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a year now, Evernote deliberately blocks me from my important data in an effort to get money from me. Im 71 years old and don't want anything but the FREE subscription so that I can continue to keep very critical medical information handy on my phone at all times. I now have been locked out of my critical data until I agree to pay $130 for a year (which I cant afford)! I NEED MY CRITICAL NOTES NOW! Why is my data being held hostage until I pay? I need my data and then will close my acct"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The functionality is very limited for free accounts. Constant ads for upgrade. There are so many free apps that do more without constant harassment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just until a year ago it was my favorite note-app. Now I decided to STOP USING IT & FIND ANOTHER APP, because of the extremely annoying, forced premium offers, each time I open a note!! 😡 You wished to get more subscribers this waY, but actually ended up making us STOP USING THE APP ALL TOGETHER!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. * * * Then they removed the recipe book. That in itself showed that it was not the users that they cared about the most. I mean they could have just stopped development of new features instead of killing the app. * * Then there are the incessant reminders about upgrading. It only works on two devices. Sorry, the subscription is just too expensive for the value I would receive at this point. * * * Now there are even more restrictions in the free account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Hi how are you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be great! Now it's so buggy and annoying. Considering finding something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This Evernote app is Fantastic especially for an old guy OG....Actually a VOG!!!!! MY MEMORY IS AGUMENTATED BY EVERNOTE!!!! THANK YOU....Now...if I coukd ever remember how to merge my two phones Evernote together....oh well. I'll make a hard copy of the other cells info!!!!"" THANKS AGAIN!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is now unusable, every time I open a note it shows a pop-up trying to sell me a paid plan. Selecting the free plan every 30 seconds is user hostile, awful company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App constantly nags user to buy the subscription for $130/year. Nag screens interfere with app functionality. I'm moving my note keeping to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't auto rotate anymore so I can't enter because numbers for passcode don't all fit in portrait mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I want to unsubscribe from this app. I can't pay for the subscription again. Please deactivate my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for sonce about 2011. Now all these ads to pay for the app and limiting the free usage. Sad they doing this. Looking for a new app for note taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Warning Free version not free anymore. You'll be bombarded with ads asking to sign up for expensive membership. Looking to move to a different note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be a useful app with lots of options for writing notes and taking photonotes. Those options are still there but the app asks after every action to upgrade - add a note - update, edit a note - update. Every, single time. In fact it's worse, I now can't even create any new notes. The free version supposedly allows 50 notes, but i have hundreds because been using this since 2011. 100% changing to another app, they have become greedy, prices are going up and now one year is 99€."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous price for one year subscription! Constant nagging to pay for subscription! Unusable! The worst! And it's getting wose! Moving to other platform. Not worth zero stars!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2016 for some quick note taking features between my laptop and my phone. Swapping to an artificial cap of 50 notes was a shocking and aggressive tactic to get people to pay for the application. I plan on clearing out what I have and moving over to an application like OneNote or Google Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Сильно урезали функционал бесплатной версии, смысла в приложении практически не осталось"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried to load my free account onto a new phone and it keeps telling me I have exceeded my device limit of two devices and places a banner over the app until I choose a paid version. Playstore recognises that I have 1 more device to install. I have 10 years of notes that I cannot access on my new phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is unusable because of the excessive promotion of the expensive upgrade to their premium plan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't be using the app for a second without an ad that's so difficult to get rid of"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yet again another update that makes this app completely unusable. Got an update, against my will, and now can't open it as the new privacy notice screen can't function on the phone. Can't accept, can't scroll, and can not get past it in any fashion. This app was once great, now it's just another annoyance I'm forced to put up with. Pen and paper is easier. Fix this stupid app so I can access my things!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for years and served well but very frustrating to use now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be the best notetaking app, but they recently blindsided users and limited the amount of notes they can create. Read the recent reviews for yourself. I suggest downloading Obsidian. It's a better app and it's free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"They are getting excessive with the trial ads. Everytime I open the app I get 2 back to back. One once a day would be expected. Other than that it's a notepad..it works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote sent out a new terms agreement that starts in February 2024. Opens when app is opened. Cannot scroll down to agree . Screen is locked. I need help. Have to get into my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the 3rd time i uninstall this app, if it is not compatible with my old ipad anymore then why it keep reinstall and told me ""it is not compatible"". This is malware?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has locked me out and doesn't think my Crome app is up to date, it actually is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's a great app would be lost without it no had problem at all and it saved my skin so many times specially when changing phones so many informations saved just connect to email my fav app i would say from ALL Until now, as I have 29 notes and it doesn't let me create more where it says u can have a maximum of 50 before the need of buying more access, and it opens options for that constantly... help me find another one like this used to be !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deserves all of the criticisms it gets. Scummy, greedy. 8.99 a month to keep using it for it's intended purpose. It's not exactly Netflix is it? F the right off. Ms 365 sub is £5.99 this mofos lost their minds with their pricing. Lol. How to alienate and lose customers by Evernote Corp."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App sucks now plans are to expensive. And the free plan is useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app since my college days almost a decade ago. Now I'm locked out because of caps on the free version which limits number of notes. Even if notes are deleted, I can't make anymore. The price for premium is ridiculous compared to other notes apps with more options for customization. Unfortunate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"IM DONE!!! I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!! Every year if feels like evernote is getting worse and worse. I'm never going to use Evernote ever AGAIN! and I suggest other people follow to send a message to these greedy MOFO!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"USE GOOGLE KEEP! I used Evernote for at least 3 years now. In the last year it started pushing me to pay and upgrade. I kept rejecting. But in the last few months the ad with the upgrade plan pops up every time I open the app and then every time I open a note and also (and that's what pissed me off) when I REOPEN a note. I deleted it. Downloaded Google Keeps, a lot better app, easier to use and not annoying with the selling ads at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a few years and I like that when I had to get a new phone everything transferred over effortlessly. Recently I'm getting constant messages about upgrading. I'm about to switch to something else because it's annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and have used it for years. Now it's intolerable with the constant bombardment of ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Gotta add back the select multiple notes option. If i want to delete more than one note, it s a burden"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Handy....but expensive and PERSISTENT. Every single time I open the app, I get a request to upgrade for a whopping $150/year. Often multiple requests in a single session. It's almost laughable. They recently limited free users to 50 notes total rather than to a memory amount. I stopped recommending this app to people months ago. Seek elsewhere if at all possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was perfect once upon a time. But now we sadly have to admit that the creators ruined everything that worked just fine, added a bunch of useless options instead and have the audacity to demand money for it with every click... Moving to other app and deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote became one of the worst note apps soo freaking fast! After using it around 13 years I gladly changed it. Keep doing the same, guys, and you'll kill the app in the nearest future. 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Switched to Things to do by Microsoft Very well organised.. Asking for premium even to a single note..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had to stop using it because of the ad spam, super annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of using, this up took a dive in 2023 becoming ad ridden app and nowhere near hiw great it was. Time to abandon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once-great app ruined. This used to be the first app I downloaded on new phones. Basic note taking, laid out with simplicity in mind. Now they try to charge for everything, including adding new notes or categorising notes into notebooks as of today. User experience has deteriorated since about 2021 massively. Why does it take four taps (adverts inclusive) to open a new note? Why do I have to pay for premium to return to the old notes-only style? Will be transferring my notes and deleting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Lots of ads, limited number of notes. Evernote used to be fairly decent, albeit quite deceptive in their advertising. However, in later years they've increased the number of ads shown, and limited the number of notes one can have, that at this point I cannot recommend it to anyone who doesn't already use it. At this stage, I'm actively looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2012, maybe even before, and it was good then. Lately, the ads are unbearable.. and they have been offering me a ""one-time chance"" every day for the past year. This app has also become so sluggish that it is irritating. I have uninstalled it and went back to my phone default notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app....no good....used to be free....not any more....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not cool that it used to be free and now it's not."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes and 1 notebook for free user is too less. I will just replace Evernote with another app. Deleted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A really well made and helpful application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for several years with no complaints. Today I open the app to access my notes....can't. A notice that all kinds of policies & agreements are updating as of 2/14/24...ok fine...but it says to click on 'continue' to agree. There is no 'continue' button & app isn't letting me open my notes....they are being held hostage! Users can't get to their info & back up notes? I have no problem with all the updates but not being allowed to get to my personal info sounds illegal!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Still relevant in 2024: Years of use without issue, now suddenly a big trash fire. I was writing down detailed pre op surgery instructions for my son, and none of them saved. Taps in the app stopped responding (even though the animations still worked) and I lost it all. I am transferring my notes to another program and deleting this one. Absolutely unacceptable. Whatever changes you are making, you have screwed up badly. I am enraged and holding back a whole lot of words."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the recent update limiting you to one notebook and 50 notes, I will have to edit this to 1 star. This is ridiculous since the multitude of problems that they have never fixed are still here. Moving to UpNote... Evernote still goes to landscape mode even if you've locked the orientation. No easy way to mass delete notes; j swipe and delete. Ads are still very aggressive; you'll basically see an ad every time you open a note. My Shortcuts keep getting deleted for some effing reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and all of a sudden I'm limited on everything I do. I've been using this app for years and now I'm going to be looking for a replacement. All they care about is money now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used the free version of Evernote for almost 10 years. The last few years I saw increasingly more restrictions on the free version. To the point now that the free version is useless to me since I can't create more notes. Thanks and goodbye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If Evernote has become this desperate to make money, it only means its lifecycle has come to an end. Time to jump ship fellas!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't need it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't save my notes and it's so slow to load that it is unusable. Checked on it again Jan 24 and it's slow and unusable as ever. What a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New 50 note cap makes it unusable. I deleted/consolidated like 100 notes and now have 36. Still says I'm over my 50 note limit and won't let me make new ones without upgrading. I'm getting a new app and deleting this one. it's inconvenient and a waste of my time. $160 is not worth it when there are plenty of other notes apps with the same features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a really good app, now constantly glitches and closes the app after approx 10 seconds meaning it's completely useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying. Only premium members can create new notes. When i try to purchase the premium version (personal), the website doesn't accept the payments. Thought of paying through the app/Google Play Store, but that doesn't reflect the offer, that I found in the website. Hard to believe that both are from the same organisation. Even more annoying is that I can't find any personal support, even for prospective customers. Changed my mind from buying the premium version, Now looking for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally everything is now premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Imagine paying $129 a year for a NOTES service. I'd rather pull out you know, a NOTEBOOK or JOURNAL. terribly annoying with their advertisements popping up constantly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be good but now there is far too much advertising trying to get you to give them money. Regular notes on cell phones are better now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and now they have made my notes inaccessible from my PC and cannot get to my data unless the app is used. It was great but now it's an overpriced ""app"". Bye bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You're just so desperate for money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great, now it's useless. Now, every time it's opened, pop-ups asking you to pay for the upgraded version destroy the experience. Even after you dismiss them, they come right back, so you can't even use it until you dismiss them twice. There are a lot of other alternatives, so I'm switching to avoid this BS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Farewell Evernote; I've been privileged to use Evernote for about a dozen years. I've seen Evernote struggle through growing pains, and am pleased to see it emerging as perhaps the finest note taking app out there. Evernote has become too big for me: I can no longer afford to use Evernote with their new business model. My data are important to me, so unfortunately I must move to a more affordable platform. Thank you Evernote, for having provided me with years of reliable service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Start blocking create notes and request for money.. Farewell Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was my favourite notebook since long time, but suddenly its free plan limits to only 50 notes and showing own ads every time 😂😂😂... No longer useable for free member its only for paid user, because i can't afford such a huge yearly fees. They could offer basic package with low charge, many could join low cost mini premium package. Far better to use Microsoft one note , good bye evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enough is enough! Disgusting sales tactics. Yes everyone, including developers need to be paid. But holding existing users to ransome over a 50 record limit? I remember when this outfit started up, and everyone was talking about it. Then they started imposing ridiculously expensive subscriptions and restricting access to two devices. And now a 50 record limit? I have moved on to Google Keep which is just one of many free alternatives to Evernote. You don't deserve any customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Requires an account to use, annoying UI and pushy on spending money. Hard pass."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App auto rotates even in locked orientation. And it is slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst service ever used"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NO ONE IS GOING TO PAY £80 A YEAR FOR A NOTES APP!!! app has always been great, now it's slowed down so much, is limited to 50 notes and even when I delete old notes it still won't let me make new ones! The pop ups and app closing all the time have ruined a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2024 EDIT OMG I just saw that I've been getting charged $7 A WEEK! NOT MONTHLY BUT WEEKLY COME ON EVERNOTE DO BETTER WHAT A TOTAL RIP OFF I have been a user for years and I'm out, no more for me thanks. Edit: bug with tags and categories updating now hopefully it will be fixed I've been using a paid subscription but my clipping are often failed. Not impressed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moved to OneNote for a week already, it's so much more stable than evernote and I no longer have to deal with it asking if I want to buy a premium plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was good at first. After the new year, the app started hounding me to upgrade to the paid version. Sometimes multiple popups within minutes. Switching to Google keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a free product with no real limits and has now imposed a subscription model with forced upcharge interruptions literally every time I open the app. I've used Evernote for over a decade and I'll be deleting it as soon as I can export my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Imagine having to pay $100 a year just to take notes. Evernote is one of the greediest and scummiest note taking app out there, the free version is basically unusable and if you choose to upgrade to the personal version, you'll feel like you just got scammed when there's plenty of other alternatives that don't constantly push ads in your face pressuring you to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is absolutely ridiculous!!!!! I've been using this app for OVER a decade!! And now it's charging me?!?! SOMEBODY IS A FAT FAIZON LIE!!!! This was the greatest app for creativity once upon a time. I'm extremely disappointed in the greed that has taken over this company. New subs, I could possibly understand, but even then, $129... such a far fall from greatness on this company. A FAT FAIZON FALL FROM GREATNESS!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They want to get payments for new notes. I say: ""greedy bastards"" and delete the app 🤷‍♂️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now I can't even use this product. I've used it for week over a decade and with the new price system I can't even add more notes because I ""exceeded the limit"". Horse hockey. Putting once free features behind a paywall (especially on an app with ads) is a recipe to make me look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been a regular user for almost 10yrs and I'm leaving. The basic free functions of a monthly limit and allowed 2 connected devices were still perfect for me as I really mainly just take notes. Now it's limited the free version to just 50 notes while I've got thousands stored inside. I once loved it and recommended it to anyone who wanted a Notes app but now I hate it for what it's become. Deleting this app off my phone forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have got to be kidding me, this app costs $170 a year? I don't care what it does, it is not worth that much money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"notes is the bomb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used this app all the time until the ads became too much. Find I spend more time clicking no than using the app. Would have been willing to pay if it wasn't so much. Even if there was a cheap option to remove the constant ads every time you open the app which also added some extra notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Organizes my life! Been using it for years. I use the basic. Updated 12/23- they want far more than it's worth to pay for. Seeking better option since they've been slowly strangling my functionality . Nice knowing you, evernote! You were maybe worth $10/ yr. Not sure where you came up with $130/ yr"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable now with the concept 'upgrade now' ads. Switching after 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very difficult to get a refund after canceling the product. The annual fee tripled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I cannot describe how annoying this app is for a basic (free) user. The amount of times I have to click I AM NOT INTERESTED IN PREMIUM is just humiliating for this app creator. Stop. I will give this app a few months to see if it continues and then will uninstall if its no better. I've had this app for years and it used to only pester me once in a while but now it is every single time, multiple times a day, sometimes 2 or 3 times back to back after rejecting their ""offer""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using the free version of Evernote for many years but since they have brought in the new 50 notes / 1 notebook limit I am going to be forced to go elsewhere. I am not going to be strong armed into a subscription and I am already well over the new limit so am unable to create any new notes. As I use Evernote for work and life planning as well as sharing documents with my husband, this has caused me a massive headache. I am off to find an alternative to transfer all my documents to..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like so many others, I've been using Evernote for over a decade. Had it synced across all my devices. This was by far my favorite app. Now it's limited to ""50 free notes"", and every button you push, an add pops up imploring you to buy some shockingly expensive subscription to REGAIN WHAT WE ALREADY HAD FOR LITERALLY A DECADE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Now I have to pay too much to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just deleted this pile of s**t"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"De cand ati decis sa promovati abonamentele, modul de promovare a devenit foarte agresiv. Acest aspect m-a determinat sa ma orientez catre OneNote. Si asta, dupa 10 ani de utilizare a aplicatiei!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gonna be moving my notes from this app to a free one WITHOUT 50 note limit. Great work devs, you got greedy and now we're all going elsewhere! If I wanted premium I'd have bought it. I don't but what I really object to is being forced into it by you stopping me from being able to use Evernote until I do so I'm out!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for 10+ years... until now. Unreasonable price tiers forced my off this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a fantastic, simple notes app for free users. I would recommend it to anyone who needed a notes app. Now the app is extremely slow and bombards users with prompts to upgrade at every screen. I've used it for over 5 years but I've had enough. I would have bought the app if it wasn't on a subscription, which is an outrageous price for what is on offer. I'm uninstalling and will never recommend this app to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great 👍 App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 6 years I finally deleted my account. I loved the simplicity of the original app but understand that subscriptions always happen when things get more complicated than they need to be. I am disappointed to be deleting it today but the push on ads was killing this for me. Good luck folks. Google keep is ugly but it's free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NOTHING HAPPENING NOW WHEN ATTEMPTING TO LOG ON. WHAT'S UP??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asks me to upgrade my account every single time I open the app or a new note. Extremely difficult to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No free access anymore to do anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription to trial very disturbing me evertime. Not recommended"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Whenever I reboot my computer, I get a request to upgrade, and I have to confirm that I don't want to upgrade. It's very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10 year Long-term user and I have to find an alternative. The app became useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"0 stars. Used to be great. I used this app for small notes and writings for years. Now they want $130 a year and limited the notebooks. I have had it for years so I am over notebooks and can't use it again unless I pay an unreasonable price. All their price categories are way too expensive. $130 is the cheapest overall. There is a $4.99 a week. I recommend paying for Microsoft 365 and using One Note. You can get a year of Microsoft Office and One Note cheaper than Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Clunky, slow and pumps ads every use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I gave this a five star review in 2013 and used it for years but it is now abysmal. The limits on notes and notebooks make it unusable in the basic version and the upgrade is extortionate. I can't even export my existing notes using the Web interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Without paying I cannot use it anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You finally did it. You made me hate this program enough to find something new. I'm allowed 50 notes. I deleted all my notes to get under 50. I have 45 notes. Your program will not let me create new ones. Learn to count. At least I don't have to put up with your constant advertisements to pay anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm another long time user. The only thing Evernote did better than Notion was the user interface, but Evernote's recent changes have undone that advantage. Take the time to get familiar with Notion. I'm so glad I did. Now that I'm familiar with it I'll never miss Evernote. One piece of hard-earned advice: Don't give in to the temptation to import all your Evernote notebooks at once. Do them one at a time to make sure they import correctly. It's totally worth the extra few minutes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can not export the notes to other apps, media ... etc - text, photos ... etc ...awful still ZERO ... can not remove RECENT ... still not ZERO but minus 100 ... UI is awful ... refreshing goes very slow ... VERY VERY SLOW ... can NOT change EMAIL NOTES TO ... it does not exist more ... IDIOTS ... how dare you ask me to subscribe ... not even for ftee ... very very SLOW ... AWFUL ... - 100 stars ... not 1 ... - 100"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a free app now I can't access my info even though I have stopped using due to paywalls."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free service gave me what I needed and I have happily used for years. Now with 50 note limit and constant pop ups about never to be repeated discounts on extortionate fees, that return seconds later has made this unusable. Moved to colour note nice simple effective and free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stay away from it, It's the kind of app that works until they finally want to slowly take features away and try and force you to pay. I imagine they do this to convert a smaller portion of the user base that has developed a reliance on it. I used to be able to go straight to my notes and then also make notes, I just went to make a new note and was told I can't with the free plan. Text is so small data wise and the app appears to mine data as well anyway.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Gij"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you're new to Evernote - turn back now. It just spams you with marketing popups that get in the way of your actual notes. Absolute trash app which once was brilliant."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My grandpa taught me early in life ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" was good now trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use it !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used Evernote for years and always loved it, but in the last year or two, the ads are absolutely ridiculous. I realize the free version of anything will come with ads to upsell, but having to close 3-5 ads and confirm my choice for each one every time I open the app is insane. Doesn't make me want to upgrade, makes me want to uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been a bloatware but after the 50 note limitation it has become useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Way too many ads to upgrade, no one time pay for life option, and the cost is too great for the services offered. I do like the app, but I don't see a great value in all the bells/whistles they're adding. It seems like they're trying to become a new total cloud productivity service (like Microsoft). It is pretty reliable. However, in the last 3-4 years of use (in the span of 1 month) three of my study notes were lost to the ether likely due to failure to cloud update. (maybe maintenance)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overpriced app for what it offers, and the free version is useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stick to what it was before!!! 1 notebook per month is rather cruel."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What used to be a decent note taking app with a good layout and varied options for personalising your notes has now become a one touch pop up machine that constantly bugs you to pay premium. You can't open, create or switch between a previous note without at least two pop ups saying you simply must pay for premium and such an incredible offer will never come up again, until you switch notes. Another case of an overly marketed product making me instinctively inclined to never pay premium prices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Love it. Update: I still love the app for what it is, but the POP UPS to get the paid version cover the screen every single time I open the app, AND occasionally they just make themselves known in the middle of writing a note. This is obscene and makes Evernote a chore to use frequently or daily as I do. TL;DR Less ads please!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app change orientation regardless the orientation settings of my phone!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Where do I start? I've had this thing erase ENTIRE paragraphs after pressing a spelling correction. It asks me every 3 minutes to pay for it and I'll ""Never have this chance again"". The auto correct function does what every single open mic comedian and twitter jokester complains about which is changes words that are already correct words to others. Its also beyond slow. Before I posted this as well I tested all out Trello, 2 other notebooks, Word, Grammarly and ChatGPT. Don't pay for this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I want to change my subscription, so I opened it on my desktop. It said I had to open on my android device. Went to my android phone and guess what it said open in your android device. There is no way to change. I'm going to have to copy notes, close the account, and delete the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Accidentally purchased the personal yearly subscription (one single click when opening the free app) and tried to get a refund from GooglePlay right away which was refused...since then trying to contact Evernote without success. They basically stole 100 euros from me and the app isn't even working smoothly!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer free. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"These lads need to fire their paid media in app person and scrap the strategy. Jesus, bombarding people with ad's when all of your insight probably says no one pays is not a ""business strategy"" like ""capacity"" shouldnt be a product. Worse experience ever. Imagine trying to monetise a note app, just greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All my notes are backed up on the evernote server but cannot be restored on my new device. What is the point of the backup if it cannot be restored?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review: I just had to update my previous review and downgrade this app from 5 stars to 1. They reduced the app from top to flop! With their super aggressive advertising strategy. Now my review from 2020: I use it since 2013 and this is one of the best apps which has been made!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"atrocious. Have been a subscripber for 10 years, stuck wtih it, even as the app got more bloated, buggy. sync function is hit and miss, collaboration fails most of the time, but still, good for random little notes and good search/tag function. however, now, i've been subscribed for 10 years, this year, paid in August as usual, evernote killed my subscription in January, and won't answer support questions. Took the money and ran. Stay away. Loads of other options now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for giving me an offer every time I make a move in application. And why is this app rotatibg when I turned off auto rotate?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was an Evernote paid user for 9 years. Worsening support, keyfeatures I've used for years removed and price increases. Have finally had enough and moved all my data to ms onenote and have canceled my account. A great shame as the product used to be awesome, now really bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app WAS awesome but now it is just rubbish, I have recorded all my notes in it but now they have logged me out for no reason. I tried logging in but it says ""error"". I want a properly good explanation for this issue. I have extremely important notes in there! Why is this suddenly happening? What's worse, they want me to pay for a subscription, RUBBISH! I want this monstrosity to be rectified NOW! This app has gone from fantastically useful to ridiculously useless! 😡😠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Should really fix this auto rotate issue. Have to restart everytime it starts doing it. Plz fix the app to portrait when the phone setting says so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled this app because EVERY time I open it I have to click a load of buttons to decline their current offer to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely unusable! Wherever I tap a pop up comes up to force me upgrade to pro!! I am uninstalling it now! It also doesn't come anywhere near the native Samsung notes app in terms of features and ease of use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To many popup come from one side to another side. Totally disgusting, Uninstalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous experience trying to maintain free use. Have you tried to unsync a device? How about your experience syncing across devices?After months of frustration, it's time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The subscription is too expensive and how do I unsubscribe it ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a decade+ Worked great for a while...Now it advertises it's paid option about 3 times per each time I use it. Finally, I'm curious about the price to shut it up and it's $15/month? Are you smoking? It's just a notes app. Whoever is running Evernote is offensively stupid. Time to use a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 of the few apps that moves on with me from phone to phone. *2024 edit* Bending Spoons, I don't like the path you're taking this once GREAT app. After convincing several teams & companies to pay for this app on a larger level for years. I will no longer do so. The free version of what you're offering is 1/100th of what it was. OneNote is now better than Evernote. I would bet Bending Spoons won't read these or reply to any of the concerns because it's already crashing & burning. FAIL."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Mandatory charging, more buggy than ever, don't get it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have the free plan & use this app exclusively for notes. This week I tried to make a new note & got a notice saying I'm at my limit & to upgrade to a paid plan. The thing is, on the notice it says the free plan gets 1 notebook & up to 50 notes - I have 1 notebook & only 33 notes. I've not reached the limit but I can't make a new note unless I pay. I'll just have to get a new note app then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After not using this app for about 5 years, I was notified about the upgrade and decided to give it a try again. Boy was I disappointed.. it forces you to use a widget that shows you ""Recent"" and ""Suggested"" notes. I tried to remove the widget as it contains embarrassing stuff not fit for work. Then it asks me to upgrade to customize widgets. What. The. HELL. I'm frankly happy with my Google KeepNotes and will never come back to Evernote again, unless they make it usable for professional use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"time to find a new notes app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Day by Day it's becoming paid app free feature's are limited. I was using this app for it's feature but sorry to say I have to move on that was a good journey with you Thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for quite some time with great results, only to find out recently that there is a limit to the # of notes you can create before you are blocked from making more until you ""upgrade"". Now, I get bugged EVERY SINGLE TIME to upgrade, which I personally do not need. If I can forgo an upgrade to disregard any future upgrade reminders, back to 5 stars!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be amazing, I remember when it was free. Now Everytime you open it, it's asking you to pay and when did this note cap happen... 50 notes max? I'll find something that's free. Total BS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So frustrating. A great, simple place to keep notes, then EVERY YEAR they stop your access until you UPGRADE for $130/year! I just want basic note-taking...not all the fancy UPGRADES! PLEASE DONT HOLD MY DATA HOSTAGE, AT LEAST LET ME GET IN AND PRINT MY NOTES OUT BEFORE YOU LOCK ME OUT!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"😈😈😈😈😈😈"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sooooo bummed to write this. I've been using Evernote since like 2011! I recommended it to everyone who would ask. It was my absolute favorite free note taking app, by far! But lately, it asks me to upgrade to the paid version literally every time you press a button on it. And it's not cheap - it's $15 a month or over $100 a year! From free to that price point is a huge jump. Sadly, after over a decade of loyalty, I'm switching to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote free version since 2011 and even paid to support the application the past couple of years until their yearly subscription costs rose from $69.99 to $129.96. Then they flattened the free limitations to only 50 notes (when I was already at 350+), multiple advertisements to upgrade had to be ack every time the app was opened, notes would refuse to load entirely, searching became buggy, and attachments failed upload. Moved to Notion instead. Serves same with less hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Vultures want $130 a year for a ""plan"" constantly spam the garage ""deal."" I deleted nearly all old notes so I can make new ones, and i just keep getting the ad for the said ""deal"" when I try to create a new note. Get real. Suppose you have up to 50 free notes, which they say in their ad that tries to scam you out of $100+ I HAVE 19 NOTES AND IT WONT LET ME MAKE A NEW ONE. FIX YOUR GARBAGE APP OR STOP FALSE ADVERTISING!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be the best, but sadly it's unusable with so many limitations"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🖐️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Took me a long time, but I have finally transferred all my notes to a different app. 👌🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It takes about 10 seconds to get past the splash screen . It's also too expensive for just my personal use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They force you to pay! Even on free trial ,they block you with a banner. I used this app for years! What a sh'tty app ! Uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the free version of this app for years, and used to love it. But now the pop up ads pestering you to upgrade have gotten ridiculous. At least one, sometimes two will pop up one right after the other upon opening. Also, when trying to create a new note, I've gotten warned that you can only have 50 notes in a notenook unless you upgrade. I have less than 10 notes total and it still wouldn't even let me create the new note! Leaving this app because it's not even worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app until 5 days ago. Then I updated and it started telling me I was logged into too many devices this month and now I can't access my notes until next month. They're holding 3 years of notes hostage to force me to pay for an account, and I'm so livid. I was waiting until I graduated to use the paid version, but now I'm just going to switch to google or microsoft notes. I feel so absolutely disappointed by how quickly this app turned hostile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the free app every day since June 2011 & the sudden harassment every time I open the app to upgrade is infuriating. I will not pay. I will find another app & ditch Evernote. ✌🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop bugging me to upgrade my account!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been with them for 12 years. I had a basic plan for 2 devices and everything was great. Recently they decided to go all paid and basically locked me from making any new notes even though they claim on the free account you can make 50 notes per year which is sufficient for me. Extremely disappointed in such treatment of loyal customers and left this app for for their competitor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not a lot of capacity. Too slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ad crazy! Used to be decent but now I cannot even open it without a pop-up ad. I understand you all want my money. But really?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For many years, maybe since day 1. There goes all my notes / note taking. 1-50 notes only? When I started seeing subscription ads for limits. Got frustrating. I understand paying for syncing multiple devices but these other little things. I will still use Evernote at a certain extent and clean up . Will limit because I still love the connectivity to my phone and computer. (I think theres other note apps out there) Had it on my tablet but multiple sync subscription got too expensive for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant upgrade popups are becoming tedious"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's been a great app for many years. Now, it freezes. For the past two months, it's been freezing up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Private personal health,appointmen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is a good and easy app which was free for personal use on 2 devices. off late they are using all tricks like popup to hide notes to force people to buy monthly / annual subscription which too is not cheaply priced. The backhand tactics speaks poorly of the company ethics. For infrequent small time personal users (and the company does have data of usage of app) such tricks are a put off for users. With competition from Microsoft OneNote they are just pushing users and customers away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The update that limited your amount of created notes was the final straw to get to me switch to another app. Even if it doesn't have all of the functionalities that Evernote does, I can easily find better out there. What a greedy move from you folk. Horrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"rodney austin ochimas sr"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Introduced unreasonable restrictions to force you to pay for premium, constant pop-ups requiring double confirmation to close makes free version unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version is really hard to beat for the features it has. Edit: My original 5 stars was true until they changed the number of notes you could have down to 50 max. I have 168 right now, down from 184. Personally I think if you had it before they changed it, you should be grandfathered in on whatever limit it was when you first downloaded the app. I don't care about storing them on their servers, I have them backed-up somewhere else. Time to find another note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Cut and paste features frequently don't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Other than the limitations the free account has, I feel over the years the app on both desktop n mobile has became slower even with greater processing devices. The premium is also more expensive than office 365 personal license... Will change to Google keep instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting greedy. Goodbye elephant in the room."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for more than 10 years, but now it's really affecting my efficiency. Its slow, very restrictive with devices and you can't use it properly because it's pushing you to buy this crazy expensive premium all the time. Onenote will be from now on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was my Microsoft One Note alternative, but since their recent update I now have to find an alternative to this. Although only having 50 notes isn't ideal, the worse thing is the constant ( when I say constant I mean everytime you switch notes) ad for me to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Truthfully I in know how to use this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: I've used this app for over 5+ yrs. Changing from 4 to 2 stars for free version. Paid version has all sort of lovely bells and whistles I don't need or want. Now they are only allowing 1 notebook and 50 notes for the free version. I use this casually and love the offering but not at the price point they are offering. Bummed but looking for another option to transfer to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for years but keeps advertising its paid version and recently limited amount of notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's pretty terrible that I've used this app for years and can no longer add notes without paying a fortune. I have over a thousand notes and now I have no way of transferring them over to another app. It's pretty deceptive to lead people to believe that they can use an app for free with the option to pay for more features, then suddenly force you to pay no matter what. They should have just charged new people who knew what they were getting into and not deceive the rest of us. Terrible Company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its horrible. I couldn't get it to let me login in at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If Evernote was not essential to my workflow I would delete it. 2021-03: slow. 2021-11: Lost notes, Very slow, Sync broken, 1 star. 2022-03: New version bad, not ready to release. 2022-04: moved to two stars based on support. 2023-05: desktop performance degraded. 2024-01: Index does not refresh, Tag queries broken - is focus on AI queries breaking existing functionality?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"About to delete because of all the pop ups. If I say I don't want it, and you say, are you sure because you won't ever get this offer again, and I say I'm sure - STOP ASKING ME EVERYTIME I OPEN THE APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be the best, I had multiple yearly subscriptions, they stopped listening now it's a P.OS. I also attempted a refund after a month on an annual service and was never replied to on their services list. After a decade of account history. I highly recommend shifting to another note solution ASAP and will be boycotting my experience with their app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EVER since Evernote was sold last year its been closing out the original audience. Most users have been here close to a decade or more. They knew ppl with yrs of notes would get cut-off ultimatum style. Many ppl don't need 80% of the features in the cheapest plan. Unsure as to why there isnt an in-btwn Free & $15/m option. Dont need tasks, calendars, or scratch pads. After research, I'll give Zoho Notebook or Joplin a try for a week. Would try Google Keep but I can tell Google is phasing it out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Price Is Too High"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. I only used the free version so had limited functionality, but it worked fine for me. Now it's almost unusable, constant pop ups and sales ads. One of them trying to get me to upgrade, when I decline it asks ""are you sure? You you cannot get this offer back"" and yet it comes back. Every. Single. Time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years. They used to be the best. Now they have absurd limitations like no more than 50 notes on a single device unless you pay insane monthly fees. There are plenty of other apps that are reasonably priced if not free with far more flexibility and access; use one of them instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can barely use the app anymore without constant popups to upgrade every time you do anything. Pretty much harrassment to give them money that never ends. I'm switching to OneNote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this app since Mar 2015. However has become very unstable over last three months. Whether on Android phone or Chromebook, bounces out without reason and content though saved along the way, is lost. This morning worst its ever been. Also become slow in loading up on Chromebook. Now got ""Note unavailable. Unable to load this note. Please refresh the page or try again later"" message."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aggressive new limits on free plan. 1 notebook and 50 notes. New paid plans ar too expensive. Least cost is $15 per month. Really? For a consumer plan? I might pay $1.99. It's a nice tool, but not worth $15 per month IMHO."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not effective"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love and recommend this app to many for years! Now I am unable to make any notes. Of course after years of use I'm way over 50 notes and 1 notebook so I was shocked today that the app blocked me from making any more notes. This is a terrible decision from the users perspective, any committed user had to either pay or find another note taking app. I'm sure many will join me in finding a better note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become utterly useless. Well done to your greed, forcing constant upgrade ads down our throat every time the app opens, upgrade now, this is a one time offer you won't get again (until the next time you open the app). Now found it's limited to only 50 notes! What a joke, good riddance this app is now a redundant waste of space on my phone and easily replaced by Google keep, which is far more stable, doesn't hang when you have a long note and doesn't crash or keep spamming you!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over 10 years user of Evernote, it was great app in the past. Now, performance is bad, super slow. Limitation of usage is also pushing users to leave it. So disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing app but the number of incredibly annoying and persistent pop up ads trying to get me to pay for an upgraded version every time I try to do ANYTHING is ridiculous. Now there is a limit of 50 notes and since I've had the app forever, I can't add any new ones. Add the INCESSANT pop up ads that they word in a way that makes it difficult to get past, and I'm just done. I'll be moving all my notes to my free Samsung notes app instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NOPE. Was good, TOO MANY POP UPS TO PAY!! I've been using for several years, with a few pop ups to pay for their paid app. $130/year for just me. Now, I get a 2-4 pop ups PER notebook I open! In 10 mins I had 12 pop ups! I keep clicking ""I'm Sure"" but it won't stop! I'm done. Looking for a new note app. This is absolutely ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great but not anymore you can only make 50 notes and one notebook. The cost is $120 a year if you want it to be of any use. No, thank you I'll be moving over to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fabulous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Unreal"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was one of the best for many many many years, but sadly ads kept showing up and now limits free users to 50 notes only and you need to pay 1000+ PHP just for unlimited notes. Too bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Nag screen makes this app horrible! Unusable. Too many ADS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app (was a 5-star review), but the new pricing model is outrageous! $100 USD per year?! I simply switched to using Microsoft Word documents on my One Drive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you Evernote. I have waited a very, very long time for you to significantly reduce the price for a personal subscription. I feel like I am now have a good deal and its justified to pay for a digital notepad EDIT : GREEDY"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why in the hell would I now pay $130 for something I have been using for free for years? If I can no longer make a new note, I guess I will look for a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be everything I needed and more. It was even worth paying the subscription for additional features, but now the free version is useless and their paid version is insanely expensive. Not sure why they ruined such a good thing..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limits the free user to one notebook and 50 notes. Another great one bites the dust."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried the trial period for the personal tier and reverting back to free is so complicated to do. It's almost like they are intentionally making it difficult so you can't get out of paying for their overly expensive plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of usage, Evernote restricted the amount of notes for free users. It's a good platform, but not worth the money they're asking. Made transition to OneNote the day I learned I couldn't make notes for free anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You money-hungry pigs, I'm moving to the phone notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I don't understand why I have to subscribe to anything, I been using this app since 2008 to hold my poems and quote and now y'all asking for subscriptions constantly and I can't see none of my files"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There's constant requests to buy their paid version every time I open this app. It also no longer allows you to create new notes unless you buy the paid version. I'm permanently switching to a different note app today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I was a user and premium subscriber for almost a decade. I tolerated as the mobile app got sluggish due to the bobber added to it continuously as I had hundreds of notes organised as I wanted them, but the tripled subscription cost is not justified by the quality of the product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How much I hate this App.. in each update they limit options and make them available for fees in addition to the frequent crashes. Just installed another app and will delete it from all devices. FOR NEW USERS: JUST FIND ANOTGER APP, DON'T EVEN BOTHER TRYNG, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, then started to spam there subscriptions. Now suddenly they have a new limit of 1 notebook with 50 notes. I'm not even filling the new ridiculous limit halfway and suddenly can't add any more notes. Just says I need to subscribe, even though I have 1 notebook with less than 25 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use the free version that has limited notes, which is fair. However, even though I deleted old notes and notebooks to stay below the limit, I'm still required to pay for the upgraded version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant acess my files after using for so long.....they want to us to pay to acess the files.....i would have given ""0 🌟"" if possible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic. Stop contacting me. 😠"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it since 2012. It was always clunky but I liked the idea, and tolerated the drawbacks because it was free. Well, now it has become unusable, and they want a lot of money for it. Bye then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was great but then advertising started going non-stop on the app. I understand that you guys have to monetize the app but in this way, you will be losing users. I loved this app but unfortunately I have to find a new one as great as this one used to be :(("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A Terrible App . I trusted it to save important data and I just found that all my data is Deleted ...never trust Evernote..delete it .it's dangerous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useful and relevant to any business or casual use! Now changed my review to 1 star. Slow and clunky and they expect to pay for functions I don't need. Meh. I am moving out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app stops working on some Samsung phones like Galaxy A51 after. And from 2024, the free version is limited to 50 notes! Time to move to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"using app for years, but now something changed and cant cotinue in creating notes, because i reached some maximum of 50. ok, this product is not available for me anymore because price 3$ (with discount) per week is unacceptable... try to find smth mor cheaper"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot send a feedback through your app Dear everyone company , It has been a great application indeed & of course an excellent experience. I have been using your app since 2014 . It is still my favourite app.  Once your goal was to increase your income rapidly, your annual plans to provide us a very expensive app has been very costly for us as regular users. So, we decided to look for another application in a reasonable price . Please, re-check the cost of your plans ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Look up ""Enshittification"" and read its definition. That's all you really need to know about the current version of Evernote. It's a shame, because it was once very good. I've been a user for more than 10 years, but now I have to move my notes. And they won't even let me take those notes ""offline"" without paying the ridiculous fee, which means they're holding my data hostage. I wonder which vulture capitalist is the new owner?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Apdet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always direct me to payment term...it is NoT fair...I have been using this for 5 -6 years...Now this app want me to sign up for PRO which contains additional payment term...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Llevo usando esta aplicación por siete años, ahora ya ni siquiera puedo usarla para escribir notas sin pagar. Empeoró con el tiempo hasta volverse completamente inútil."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10yr+ ex customer --FYI TLDR google keep will operate in secret folder and sync to your G drive w offline cache, UNLIMITED FOR FREE FOREVER... xferrd all my notes. You guys slowly broke the best thing out there. So u limited the number of notes I can make? I just tried to add a new note, which I checked and I don't have that many, less than 15, and get an ad to pay $130 a year? Then two more after, Seriously? I can just use Google keep and it'll sync to my G drive for free, unlimited. GOODBYE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HAS HAD ISSUES FOR OVER 7 MONTHS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Finally done with evernote... At some point recently they changed their model for free accounts so you only get 1 notebook and 50 notes. That's OK with me, but I have 35 notes split between 2 notebooks, and the app won't let me move any of the notes from one notebook to the other to eliminate one. And it won't let me create any more notes even though I'm under the total limit of 50. Good luck y'all, I'm finding a different note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to love Evernote now I want to switch they're always trying to sell there membership and only few devices and alot slower than it was about 2 years ago or so"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Acts like a virus"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beyond useless. No features, constant ads, and a stupid subscription on an app for taking NOTES. And if you don't spend money? Only 50 notes. Like created. Doesn't matter if you delete them. The app tracks how many notes you actually create. Once you hit 50, they tell you to cough up. Uninstalled as soon as I saw that. What a joke lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get your information out of Evernote before it goes out of business. I've been using the app/web for decades and Evernote was the gold standard but they just kept tamping down on features for free users to the point it was entirely a paid app. Nothing wrong with that at all. But there are free apps that do mostly the same things. I'll be moving to Microsoft one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was a decent app... until they added the 50-note limit. Now it's garbage. I've migrated all my notes to another app, and it's actually way better - for free. EDIT: No longer able to access my free account - these guys are going downhill fast."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"At one point this was a great app. Then greed set in and you held us hostage with HUGE prices. Granted, there was still the free option, but we knew what was coming. Not to mention the incessant begging to upgrade. I'm happy to say I am NO longer an Evernote user. I found another app that will work just fine. Greed destroys - remember that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once the ""best note-taking app,"" this app was my go-to for note-taking on anything and everything. I was even getting close to considering an upgrade as my side-hustles were taking off. Then the company ruined themselves by heavily restricting the storage and amount of notes available to free users, making it effectively useless. I recommend avoiding these guys, given their recent treatment of loyal users, and have moved all my notes to a superior, free app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love Evernote, but now I can't use the app at all without getting 3 or more pop-ups trying to get me to pay for a yearly subscription! I'm just going to use Google Keep Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 star for Forcing updates, ive used the app for absolutely years its worked fine and never faultered, not once... Until this week! Theyve diliberatley made it not work unless i update. I dont want to update, 50% more memory for what!? its just a note pad on a cheap phone. I predict the next thing will be moving the minimum from Android 6.0 to 8.0, out moding even more low end users. Forcing ""updates"" is obsoleting phones and thats not good for the environment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They're getting greedy with the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good app but nowdays its slow, also they are super agressive on pushing their premium which makes it even slower (because I dont only need to wait for it to load SLOWLY but also the 3 adds to load SLOWLY (No? Are you sure? 1 time offer only -every day) Disgusting spam. Also it doesnt let you export without premium so dont get into the trap of starting to use this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"why are you distroying evernote??the new update and ui is too much laggy and slow.it takes almost 20 sec just to open a previous note nd sync have bacome also very slow.really disappointed 😞 update - sorry but my phone couldn't keep up with this app anymore nd for this shifted to google keep.though it took some days to move all the notes one by one by copying and pasting.. but i did it. sure,miss may featurs of evernote but it became too much painfull ... take care"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"App problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every since the update I can't add a new note. I can edit ones I have, but that's it. When I try to add new note I get your ""upgrade now "" add for 129.00 a year. Said I'm allowed 50 notes and one notebook with my current plan (free). I don't have near that many (50) notes, yet you will not let me add another. What's the deal?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Even before the newest update, the constant harassment you'd get every time you'd open the app to upgrade was nearly unbearable. Now they're limiting you to one notebook and 50 notes. DO NOT UPGRADE THE APP. What a useless piece of garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2014 and my experience up to 2023 partly has been awesome. THE UPDATE DONE IN 2023 NOT TO ALLOW ONE DO A BASIC NOTE & NOTEBOOK WAS A FLOP. I STILL BELIEVE THE TEAM CAN DO BETTER. IF NOT, WE CAN MOVE TO OTHER APPS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"irritating popups at the startup and when searching for a note. some notes take time to load and save."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"wow are yall fr limiting the number of notes to 50"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Could you please stop asking me to buy your plan every other minute?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best, but corpo greed got the best of it. I wouldn't mind to pay a logic price for the service but €50+ per year is unfortunately too much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a wonderful app, i could keep notes for school, work, hobbies. Now you're allowed 1 note book with room for 50 notes unless you pay an absolutely ridiculous subscription. I can no longer recommend this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was really great, i had a perfect place to store notes and other stuff. It had a monthly size limit and a 2 device limit but it was still good because it did what it was supposed to do, let you store notes. Now they limited the free version to 50 notes. No more notes. If anyone's reading this i found a great alternative called Obsidian. Try it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's one of the worst app. I have used this and now they ask to for purchase primium for view"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no longer free and constantly trying to charge me. also cannot access notes offline anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing. But has turned into a money grab. Costs as much as a streaming service! After years of being a loyal user, I'm blocked making more notes unless I give in to their extortion. Would be worth it if the price was in any way reasonable. But it's 20x more expensive than reasonable. There's much better options. Use one of them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version recently become totally useless. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Been a user for many years, but constant advert to upgrade (ridiculous price) and frozen out of basic features..... Many better alternatives, free and premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be decent but now plagued with ads to switch to the premium version. Premium version is very expensive and seems overpriced so did not purchase. As I mainly use this for just note taking I've switched to Microsoft OneNote and have not looked back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to buy premium version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"really helpful 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not sure how it happened but I lost all my notes. They were they there one day then gone the next"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using the Windows app to take notes since the beginning of my college career, I logged in to find out I can only have one total notebook and 50 notes when I used to have separate notebooks for each class. This wouldn't be that bad if they weren't trying to get me to spend $159 a year to re-unlock the features I used to have for free. Deleted my account and I'm switching to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version was good, but the interface was not easy. App was working as expected, until they sent us an offer to upgrade app to premium version when the app opened, it's really really really annoying. After this review, I will Uninstall this app and will never use this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too many ads. Used to be a handy app. Now even checking off a task requires too many step. Very annoying. I understand free use means some ads, but I get one every time I open something. I'm oretgy close to shutting down my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others, I have had Evernote for about 8 years. I have always loved the app, but now there is a 50 note limit and an extortionate price on getting anymore. The app has constant pop-ups to upgrade with me having to close and open the app multiple times as it seems to crash on these pop-ups. Also, my notes started deleting as the app now seems glitchy. I've moved to ColourNote, which is actually a much better app, free and without the pop-ups or extortionate prices!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was a fantastic app, with a smooth interface, loads of options and smooth ui. Emphasis on WAS. While the above is still true, it is now locked behind a ridiculous paywall. It is absolutely not worth the astronomical subscription fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the heavens happened to Evernote????!!!!! I can't believe they bought in to the fad of overcharging customers and driving them away to their competitors. Nice job! Who ever advised this overcharging pop up trend has driven your business into a downward spiral. As for now I'll be deleting my account unless a pop up ad will show up there charging me for a delete option. What a shame really. Tsk tsk!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using evernote for 10 years if not more, but not free anymore. What's my alternative now? Very disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Goooood"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Infinite ads make the new release completely useless. I'm migrating to another service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this for more than ten years but just discovered the limitations they've introduced to force money out of everyone. Yeah, no. Won't be back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"STAY AWAY!Been a user since 2016. Bombarded with pop ups to upgrade. Layout, UI, everything has dropped in quality. Have to upgrade for the simplest of features and cant even remove the obnoxious banner they've added above all my notes unless I upgrade. Now imagine having 100s to even 1000s of notes built over a decade, just to be hit by a cap of 50, and a single notebook to stick them all in. I'm speechless at the greed. If you want a simple app, use Google keep as it syncs with google account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 notebook with 50 notes??? or awkwardly high yearly subscription?? used it since 2013. Will migrate to some other fair place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I do a lot of journaling and an inspiring stand up comic. it helps me collect and organize my thoughts. Tremendously"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant popups to get you to buy the pro version for $120 a year, which is ridiculous. If never pay that much yearly for a simple note app. It used to be good, now its unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I noticed I rated this app 5 stars back in 2014...sadly I have edited my review to 1 star. Evernote used to be my favorite note app. Now it's riddled with useless/obnoxious adds, and most recently I am not allowed to create any new notes. I'm sure enough people we'll buy the paid version, so this review means nothing. Sadly, I will be looking to use a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit for a note app. Good job gang"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Long time user, generally very happy with the web and desktop versions. Mobile UX can be an issue, I had to report a severe bug with tagging new notes on an Android phone. My latest big concern is that the app is unusable on Samsung S9+, it crashes upon opening a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Leaving evernote after 8 years. Their plans are too costly for a basic user like me. There are lots of free apps in the market. Migrated to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be amazing. Now it keeps popping up with push ads for their premium service. It's way too intrusive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for close to a decade and loved it. Ignored the occasional upgrade ad. Now, it pops up every time I use the app. Congrats, you played yourself, switched and uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"They some bugs, its not optimal for my flip 4 . But it's really good but some frustrating things."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Now all they want is your money, quickly accessing a note is impossible for 'promo' prompts are galore. Sad times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been running Evernote for many years... they have continued to push their Ad Wall within the free version to the point it makes using this app extremely frustrating. Most recently, they've now reduced the limit on Notes to 30, and as I've had this app for a long time and have more than this limit in my account, I am forced to say NO pretty much every click... or agree to a couple HUNDRED dollars to be free of this. Are you guys crazy?? Your price is absolutely absurd. Stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the single best notes app on the market, now it's a shadow of its former glory. $130 per year to use the service? No, thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"My previous review was 12 years old and gave 6 stars. Since that time, I gathered a lot of notes and notebooks. The recent wind down of the app (max 50 notes, one notebook) makes the app unusable for me and takes my notes hostage. I lost my trust in this company. Too bad I had to find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like it, now it doesn't allow you to create a new note unless you pay! They want £80 per year for keeping notes. That's ridiculous!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"La insistencia para pasar a un plan premium es tan grande que tedioso usar la app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolutely amazing App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Now Syncing automatically most of the time. But still manually sync button is required to ensure gaurantee of sync. Because sync is performed or not, that indication is not there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot uninstall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been gradually getting worse and I'm now fed up and contemplating using an alternative. Can't even find a search function after latest update. How am I supposed to find my notes?? Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Love the app and functionality. Absolutely despise that it keeps pestering me to upgrade every damn time I open the app. Infuriating and making me want to not use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incredibly expensive...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is now a money grab. Ten years plus of material is now being exported to other programs, because there's no reason to pay what they're charging for monthly. It's sort of comedy lol It's really easy to export your notebooks and notes into free / cheaper programs. A quick Google search will help out! So long, Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app until it went to the paid version. Now, anytime I even think of opening the app, they try and get me to pay them $130 for the year. Good app for simple notes, not worth paying for. Because they harass me for money every time I open the app, I'm lookin for alternatives. Way to ruin a good thing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happen??? I also can't move to my main folder.. after update it said only 50 note with 1 folder only. But i am old user. I have ton of folder. If you don't want me to have more than 1 folder, but at least give me the ability to move all my note into my main folder..... i absolutely never use this note again !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the app 10 years ago and i loved it. Now they want $130 a year? Wow! No thanks. Onenote, here i come!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years and loved it. Now all of a sudden I can't make any new notes without paying $129.99 a year. Sorry Evernote, I will be moving all my notes elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote since 2016 but all of a sudden i can't find more than 90% of all my notes anymore. Please let me know what happened to all of them as i am very dissapointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increasingly spammy and intrusive promotions. Will use a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"genuinely terrible app. buggy, unintuitive, unresponsive, and horribly designed. even sharing a note with my girlfriend was almost impossible. it takes you through the account deletion process by making you tap 'delete' multiple times, and then when you switch apps to copy the deletion verification code, it resets the whole process. i had to open the app in a web browser to even delete my account. don't waste your time with this garbage. i would rate this 0 stars if i could."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I uninstalled immediately when I saw that the subscription is five dollars A WEEK. Not even worth trying the trial. Lmfao."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing that I cannot create any more new note without paying. And I have to deal with annoying ads every timr accessing to existing notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Done with this nonsense. I've been a user since 2010, now everytime I want to make a note, I get bombarded with stupid notifications about upgrading. And now I can only have 50 notes otherwise they want me to upgrade. Well enoughs enough, there's 100's of note taking apps on the playstore so I'll be uninstalling and moving on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had lots of notes, reduced it to 27, but still doesn't let me create new notes up to 50 limit. Is that a 50 new note lifetime limit? Lolz. This was brilliant 10 years ago, now capitalism has ruined it. Gonna be looking for a new, free note app. Bye Evernote, was good while the bean counters were suppressed, im gonna think a lot of people will bail now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It usefull"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could turn back time, if I could find a way, I'd warn myself to not bother w/ Evernote. As w/ most things Internet, I recall times when a site/product/app slowly realized that their business model wasn't profitable enough. This inevitably lead to clawing back features and putting them behind a paywall. Still not profitable enough? Put even MORE features behind the paywall. Keep doing this until you have a WORTHLESS product and sit back and wait for obscurity. Thx, Evernote. One notebook? 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait and Switch. I've been a big user of this app for almost a decade. Used pretty much daily. Obviously I understood not all the features would be available to me as a free user, but that's completely fine. Now I'm basically locked out of all the features unless I spend an egregious amount of $15 a month. I would've been happy to spend $2-$3, but $15 is way too much for a glorified notebook. I'm done with this process of bait and switching. Hope the company regrets this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a great app ruined by ad's and random promotions! 🤦‍♂️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used the app for years, now being forced to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""As of December 4, new and existing Evernote Free users have a maximum of fifty notes and one notebook per account."" It's so interesting how I first downloaded this app in 2014, and in the span of a decade, it's steadily become more and more worthless cause y'all keep locking things behind paywalls. I've never spent a dollar on this app and never will. Gonna transfer all my files to Microsoft Word and delete Evernote. Goodbye Evernote, it was nice knowing you. I can't say I'll miss you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Big familu"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's become horrible. Was stable for years and it's just dead to me now. The bugs that still are not resolved after two years is unbelievable. Was able to use the old version for android for the past 2 years but now they cut me off and forced me to upgrade, and I truly cannot believe the bugs present. Paid user for over a decade, and now going to cancel and switch at my earliest opportunity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for years and I love it but I'm definitely willing to have to move my notes elsewhere and delete it. I can't make any more notes you have to pay a minimum of $130 a year to make more than 50 notes I feel like that's an incredibly low number of notes for so much money. I'm worried about what will happen to my much more than 50 notes that remain in the app now so I'll just be converting somewhere else that's not unreasonably high in price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This App freezes up on me and I have to turn off my phone to make it work. It's very frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Agree with people leaving 1 star. I just use the basic features and keeps asking me to upgrade constantly. Please stop, you're making the app annoying af."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the app from about 8 Years now and been doing great. I kept using it even after the hack but turns out now they only want to earn money and not keep it freemium. I feel I'll stop using this now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The constant begging for a monthly subscription every time I use the app has me searching for another. I'm a light user, I would pay a one time fee but not a monthly subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the app for 10 years or so, and now I can't stand it. Each time I open the app, I have to decline 3 popups with ""exclusive offers you won't ever get again"". Until the next time I open the app, which makes the ads for subscription lying marketing. And now I can't make any more notes, which is absolute horrible for a note-taking app. I will be looking for alternatives, as this app really have made some poor choices to squeeze money out of its customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Relentless popups pushing overpriced promotions every time i open the app make this a frustration to use. Lots of other less annoying free alternatives out there these days"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love the app it help with the paper work I do"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What Happened??!!! I was a user for about 4-5 years and then bam! I can't create any new notes or barely access the notes that I've had with the ad to pay for a very expensive subscription. Going elsewhere! It was a great tool but...this wasn't the best move."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch garbage. They've locked writes to free accounts with more than 50 notes and jacked the price up to ludicrous. $160 for 51 text files"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This begging for me to subscribe with a promotion every day is making the experience really bad. You could have my subscription back by offering a good service worth of it, instead of making the service worst by begging."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting ready to switch...the 3 upgrade ads every time you turn on the app are just way too much and a pain in the a**. If these ads don't disappear within 2 weeks, I am going to permanently switch away from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What they said! Taking notes for $140 per year? I'd sooner take notes with crayons in a composition notebook with my non-dominant hand. Business is definitely messy, and profits keep the lights on at the end of the day. They could have went in a direction where note features like video and cloud storage are locked instead of notes with just words. Us long-time users have a right to be upset. Great while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"0/5 STARS, NOT 1 -- I've been using this app for years because it was pretty awesome, I even became a paying subscriber to support a decent app. Now they're charging a RIDICULOUS rate for an AVERAGE app. I'm removing everything I've written ( if I even still can) and then I'll use all social platforms to warn people NOT TO EVER USE THIS APP. I'm totally disgusted by this.. I was ""offered"" a 25% discount rate to resubscribe at a 400% marl up. Which means regular price is 500% ZERO STARS"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last version keep rebooting and crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Quite handy but frequently exiting without any reason. Very annoying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great, free app for notes. It then started advertising it's paid version every. single. time. I opened it. Now, they've gutted the free version entirely so you basically have to pay for it. Oh, and until I change to another app, I have double the pop ups in it to upgrade. Twice the adverts. No longer is Evernote worth anyone's time, unless you really want to subscribe to pay a very high cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has changed ive been using it since 2018 because of all the hype and the ease of use Well, forget it, now you have to pay $130 to use the app annually what a waste of time i have spent using it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is my go-to App for all notes! I have 1,000's of notes - I love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app is horrible, they try and choke you into buying there paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The UI is horrible. It's so slow, and editing notes sucks. The app insists on rotating to landscape even though I have my phone set to portrait and auto rotate turned off. The whole app is overrun with ads, too—everywhere you look, you're being pestered to hand over your money. I can't stand it. I've used Evernote for over ten years and I am sorely disappointed with what's become of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Now I have to pay for unlimited notes? No, thanks. I'll use something else. It was good enough for the simple notes I needed to make, but they've updated it so that I have to pay to create any more new notes. I don't think that's going to motivate people to pay for it, but only to stop using the app and find a different one. Bad idea."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've taken free features and placed them behind a paywall. You get one notebook with 50 notes. I at one notebook with 28 notes and I cannot make anything else without paying, despite the service itself advertising a 50 note maximum. This service went from stellar to awful. Would not recommend, will be transitioning to another service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What has the widget gone? Hardly making life easier is it? Had enough now. You've shut down my ability to use the app on one fell swoop ($14.99 per month just for note taking?) Migrated to Obsidian return self hosted real time live sync and couldn't be happier. Enjoy rest of the time that your company continues you exist."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user. I am very unhappy that I now have to pay $170 or $130/year for my favorite note app. The new company that bought evernote is trash. You have millions of users willing to stay for a resonable price but instead decide to charge this crazy price per year. Where's the non pro price? It's either pay $130-$170 or leave?? Where's the consideration for your long-term customers?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reduces the free features up to the point where you MUST subscribe or won't be able to use the app. Disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a happy premium member for over a decade and was a huge Evernote fan until recent updates have created a huge lag in opening the app on my phone. When the app finally loads it keeps freezing and I often have to try at least 3 times to open a note. It used to be worth the subscription fee but with these new issues and lack of substantive improvements, the constantly increasing subscription rate makes it no longer worth it. Shopping for a new notes app, sadly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, I'm here to join the club of people let down by Evernote. I lost 5 years worth of notes. Damn shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"mst hai bhai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of this year, the free plan is useless with only one notebook and 50 notes. With discount, it's now €60 for a year (normal €100). Time to switch to another app as I have 1400 notes and counting, bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are u F'ing kidding me! A $128/yr just to EDIT previously made notes!? I started using this app once Catchnote went down. I've missed that app ever since... Evernote (which isn't so bad, but could be a lot better and simpler for every charging upgrade). Never paid before. Never found the extra features worth subscribing to. Now I don't mind paying for quality but this app is not worth it. It's time to get back to pen and pad!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rubbish and paid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost all my notes because i could not update to a certain version, this app is complete bs, look elsewhere!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is my first app review, which I'm writing because I'm so frustrated! I've loved this app for many years. It's worked great for me. But now EVERY time I open the app, it asks me if I want to upgrade. Sometimes it even asks twice! After months and months of this, I'm done!!! I'm using a different note app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote is getting worse and worse (at least the free mobile version). If you don't already use it, I wouldn't recommend that you start."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used Evernote for years to keep track of different things for years. Used to be good, and never had to pay for Premium, but now the app will pester you about paying every time you open it. The subscription is ludicrously priced, who would be paying ~$130 a year for a notes app? Notes get duplicated, formatting text is buggy, this thing just sucks now, look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Enough for limitations!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was an okay note app but now it is unusable without paid subscription. It is damn slow or doesn't even load my notes. That's a shame I have most of my notes here but gonna move to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would give 0 for enforcing users to purchase subscriptions. Disgusting"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't mind that you changed it to only 50 notes before you force me to pay for this BUT I am currently at 35 notes and still can't create new ones amd get the pop up of ""limit reached - 50 notes max"". I've been using this app since 2011. Way to loose customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant messages to upgrade EVERY session. They have all of a sudden dropped it from unlimited notes on 2 devices to 50 notes on 1 device. Joke. Just after your money. Find another service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blocking me from accessing my old notes on my devices because I've reached some new note limit they just imposed. It was free for years, now charging 100 a year to use it without having the pop up saying pay for me every 2 seconds. What a shame. Will change to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had Evernote since 2015 and always loved it. I dont know when the change to ""1 notebook, 50 notes"" happened, but its a total scam. I'm not paying £79.99 a year for something other apps do for free. I can literally buy over 10 real notebooks for this subscription fee, capitalism gone mad. I'll be exporting all my notes to another service. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote record is there important matters"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be 5 stars now slow, buggy, limited to 50 notes and charges a fortune if you want any user ability"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It sends me a vertification code to confirm to permanently delete my account, but once I go to it... It exits me out:("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It changed for the worst and many features that were free now are paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using your app for 10 years. But what have you done with pop-ups and ""offers"" is unbearable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and have used it for years to keep a lot of writing organized for projects and such. I had the paid version for a while but didn't use it enough to justify spending money on it. I've been on the free plan for over a year now and I can deal with the constant push to upgrade and the 2 device limit but now the 50 notes limit has ruined it for me. I'm looking for a new app to move my projects too so I can continue to expand them. I'm very disheartened to be leaving Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🌻😎😱😎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"كان برنامج ممتاز.. فجاة قررو يسوه بفلوس وصار يقولي ان لي بس ٥٠ نوت.. وحتى الاشياء المخزنه مو بسهوله اقدر افتحها.. جاري البحث عن برنامج بديل"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest round of ""performance improvements"" has crippled the app, imposed a crushing limit on number of notes, and pushed upsells on every square inch of the screen.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user of this app and watched it go down hill QUICK!

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for nearly a decade. Using it to make lists for everything from groceries to potential baby names. I've loved it up until this year. Now, suddenly, it's glitchy and incredibly ANNOYING. Glitchy because it randomly (but very often) does not save the last few words I type. Even when I hit save several times. Annoying because it asks me LITERALLY EVERY TIME I OPEN A NOTE if I want to upgrade. When I hit no, it asks again because this is the ""last chance for a discount"". Just stop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app used to be great for on the go organization and note taking. now it's a constant cash grab and nickel and diming for every feature. you're better off anywhere else, and I'll be moving my data away from it as well. if you're not paying for their plans, you don't get anything without struggling through aggressive ads and them blocking off access to your data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome app.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The paid version is exorbitant and the price is increasing. The free version asks you multiple times per day to upgrade to a paid version. OneNote has all the functionality and none of the harassment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After years of using your app, I've uninstalled it and giving it a 2-star rating. It has been helpful and wonderful for the past couple of years, but the excessive popups and buggy restrictions on my notes is unacceptable. Despite the 50-note limit, I can't make any new notes after just NINE NOTES. And the repetitive subscription popups that appears every time I open a new note is downright annoying. Not going back to your services. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was an amazing app, but unfortunately the company developing it decided that you can only get 50 notes. I have been using it for more than 5years so I have hundreds of notes that I now have to migrate to another app. The amount of adds and requests to pay for the ""pro"" version are out of control. This is very sad given how good the app used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Now it's basically unusable in the free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There's absolutely no way I'd ever pay $130/year for this service! What's worse is, after I deleted 7 notes to free up space, they still wouldn't allow me to create any new ones. Apparently hitting that 50 note limit once is enough to prevent you from ever making more until you pay them. I permanently closed this account today. There are too many other better alternatives on the market to stay with Evernote. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE! May your greed be the end of your business."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much reminders to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like this apps but it is annoying that it keeps asking users to pay for upgrade even if you declined the offer. There's no need to keep asking if I already declined the offer thousand times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a long time infrequent user. However, now I'm limited to one device, 1 notebook and 50 notes. This is fine, I currently have 1 notebook and 47 notes, but cannot create a note due to a limit reached error. Time to look for an Evernote replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good but constantly try to sell me 40% off the paid version, every time it says I will not receive this offer again but every time I use it I get offered it twice whilst using it. Very much interrupts my work flow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"USE A DIFFERENT APP (I flipped to Keep) Used to be a great app, but constant upgrade ads bogged it down and made syncing clunky (would often get conflict notes). Newest pay barrier of ""One Notebook, 50 notes for free, $100 for more"" has me moving to Google Keep, which has been MUCH SMOOTHER."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good-bye Evernote. I've migrated to One Note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Keeps pitching it's paid version with annoying prompts. Free version isn't allowing offline editing. After years, i moved to notion and the experience is seemles in comparison."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote started to squeeze out their customers, annoying advertising everywhere, limited notes etc. Sad to see what happens when money and not the customer comes first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am quitting this app because it has become too greedy.... Rs 279/month is too costly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote just charged me S$104.01 for something I never purchased. Even if it's premium subscription, my own account isn't even upgraded! And there's nobody to contact in Evernote. And they keep directing you to the forums, which are old. Many posts are dated more than 1 year old... Guys, move to another app. And remember to uninstall Evernote. It will secretly hack into your phone and make fraudulent charges."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really don't like this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice and Easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for a long time but like other users I'm not constantly bombarded with the offer for purchasing premium. It pushes offers on me EVERYTIME I open a new note which is so annoying and makes the app very hard to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app but it still needs bug fixes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bombards me with ads. Not worth the effort and frustration to get through them. I will use a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've loved using Evernote for years, but nowadays apparently storing more than 50 notes in your phone is considered a premium service by them. And we are not talking about a couple dollars per month. Evernote premium has prices that compare to actual cloud storage costs. I don't plan on using this app much longer due to this fact."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If ppl have also become money minded,if u have to only provide the paid version why dont u remove the free one. So many pop ups,so many ads,this is really frustrated. I have started to look for other good alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$160 per year to use a notebook app? No thank you. At 50% off that's still absurd"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The 50-note limit is a brain-dead move. I've been using Evernote since 2015 but I guess I have to migrate to other note-taking apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was great until they started charging a monthly membership to be able to access it. Ridiculous how everything now has a membership. Almost $15/month to use an app when Microsoft office is literally $8/month. Not worth it AT ALL. I guess I'll be transferring my files and deleting this foolish app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not Able to take the data out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Liked it and used for for years. Sick of popups lately to buy full version. Now its a piece of rubbish app. It forces you to paynow. Im currently moving my notes to another app. Goodbye evernote forever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really disappointing. Updates have made it so clunky to use now, and there is no useful free version. The app is functionally useless to me now without paying. Won't be using it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was good in 2010 but now the features are outdated, it has trouble syncing, limits how many devices you can sync, and tries to charge a $100+ yearly subscription on every page. There are better note apps now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. now it's not. went to a subscription model. not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very good so far"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really slow and clunky and very expensive too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EXPENSIVE! Used for years, now wanting more money for basic functionality. Deleted all my notes, and now I'm uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app on and off for a few years. At this point, I highly recommend OneNote or Notion instead. Evernote free version is 99% useless nowadays. They've continued to squeeze every feature out of the free version until now they're losing once loyal customers. In my opinion, Notion or OneNote are both better (and they're free) than even Evernote premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote premium since 2012, loved it before v10 but the new version changed the app considerably. I use evernote for everything and have depended on it for quick note entry and retrieval for years but the new evernote has actually become unreliable. Search doesn't show all the notes, offline doesn't actually download anything, it's incredibly slow, and the home feature really just shows a few notes at a time. It's really too bad, was a fantastic app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to record speech to text on Android Galaxy S10, despite granting microphone and media permissions. It listens but doesn't transcribe and then the microphone turns itself off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 5 stars until new pricing and STOP POPPING UP about professional app YES IM SURE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Upgrade pop-up ads have become unbearable. Their business model has now switched to pulling features away until you pay. I've even considered premium but the price is no where close to value of the ""extra"" features. Will be moving my 10+ years of notes somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a free user for years but they are all but forcing me in to an expensive subscription, which I will not do. I'm a hobbyist writer at best so I'm just not ever going to be a buyer, but I'm only allowed 1 notebook and 50 notes now. There was no mention of the fact that when you delete notebooks you wouldn't be able to replace them, when I could have just renamed them and kept them instead... Working on migrating my notebooks to something new, this is a soulless husk of what it once was."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You said I will be able to create 50 notes for free, within app it's showing the same. I have 11 notes and it's not letting me create a new one. And telling me to buy a plan. Btw, thanks for letting me create 11 notes. 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible changes. I can no longer add any notes without a paid plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"MIGRATION COMPLETE, BYE EVERNOTE, WE WILL NOT MEET AGAIN. I have used this app for years. It had its shortcomings and annoyances, but was a great note app. I now have hundreds of notes and notebooks, which I cannot use anymore after the free plan has been downgraded. Sad, but no choice, will be moving my notes to One Note. Exodus has started."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used the free version of Evernote for years and I love the layout & features. But they just keep asking for more and giving less. Now every time I open the app, open a note, close a note, open a different note, etc, Im bombarded with pop-ups begging me to upgrade. I have to close out both the popup and the confirmation which is annoying to do appx 7x during 1 minute of using the app. I would've considered upgrading if it was a lifetime fee, but $130/yr AND you're annoying about it? Be fr"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the free app for years. Now due to a money grab it is useless. I understand you have to make money. But your subscription price is 13 times what the app is worth. It's a note app. There are literally tones of free good ones. You can't price your app like it is the only thing on the market that can...take...notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many times asking for upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrendous Experience! This app will kill you with trying to buy a subscription and it is so unbearable that you want to delete the app altogether which I did."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update 2024: outrageous increase in premium took away 2 stars... In simple terms Evernote basically organises my life past 5 years both work and personal. It is everywhere, combines, harmonises and presents when I need. Chrome extension, email account, making note links, tagging, storage, scans docs.. And if I need something new, I know there is a way to make it work. I am just concerned over security I hope they protect our data well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app like 10 years ago. Now it's slow and bloated. The newest explosion of pricing is the last nail for the coffin. Absolutely overpriced for what it delivers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been both a paid and a free user over the years. If you need an app for casual use look elsewhere! The free version is now completely annoying and useless so plan to pay $129/year at minimum. I've seen this company go from a very good platform that provided value with both their free and their paid service, to a company that is no longer seaking to provide value as their first goal. It's now $. They would be better off not offering a free service at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good decision"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to LOVE this app for personal use. It works very seamlessly on my phone and desktop. I had the 💲 paid personal tier for years, and now they're trying to get rid of that tier to force me to pay a 2x priced tier upgrade? It used to limit a you based on MB usage, and now I can only make 1 notebook and 50 notes OR pay 15.00/month? You guys need to bring back a tiered system for us that only need a limited amount of notes/users. This was a bad transition. 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not free anymore, if you reach 50 notes. I wouldn't recommand start using Everynote to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nowhere near as good as it used to be: I feel the premium version of this app is probably now considerably overpriced. Performance was poor last year but after renewing this year I am seriously regretting this decesion. Functionality has got significantly worse with the latest updates; the automated help is totally unhelpful. I think there are now much better options than this previously awesome application. The free version might be okay but as a premium user this app is becoming unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 2 years and around 300 notes this app becomes crazy, they absolutely ask money, if u don't want to pay, for each review request of your own notes, you have to close min two advertising. This is unbelievable, time consuming and extremely annoying. I moved all notes one by one to Samsung Note and removed this insisting application. Be careful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive for what offers. Canceled the paid version due to that. Constant asked for disconnected other devices and didn't allow my data. When I proceeded to disconnect, the app just froze. I was planning to keep using the free version but honestly, I will migrate my data somewhere else and be done with Evernote. Leaving after 10m years of user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app since 2011 which was functioning really well with the ability to sync notes across devices, with a simple platform for note taking. However recently they have limited the free version to only 50 notes and syncing to only 2 devices, with annual membership being over 100 dollars a year (basically like microsoft office membership prices). When there are other good free apps on the market like Notion, not worth starting on the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for 14 years. Everything I wrote since I was a teenager was on it. Until the company made it UNUSABLE in a hostile way if I didn't subscribe to the premium version! I couldn't make new notes and notebooks bcz of limits in the free plan. I rue the shittification of a great product for profits!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nevernote. Evil commercial trap. Rather use a physical notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Free plan only allows 1 notebook and 50 notes. I was creating a new notebook in the app today, it's saying that limit reached Upgrade to create unlimited notes and notebook. Edit:- Notion is the best alternative to Evernote. It also offers import data from Evernote. It is the best alternative to Evernote. I don't recommend this app to anyone. Before, free users can have 100,000 notes before Bending Spoons took Evernote. Worst app. Bye Evernote. Hello Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Getting popup again and agin for the subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but the constant spamming - at least 2 ads every time you open it - is making it unusable. You just want to be able to quickly add something to your shopping list while you think of it and by the time you've clicked 'no I don't want an overpriced upgrade' so many times you've forgotten what the thing was."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For years I would sing the praises of this app letting me have notes on my PC and on the go. But all of a sudden they decided to be greedy and slowly pay way ALL the features. Now the app is damn near in operable with relentless popups to upgrade to premium (the old version of the app). Recently the app has limited how many notes you can have to barely any, removing any previous use it might have had despite that. Disgraceful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Rubbish"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2015, but afraid I'm moving elsewhere now. App has got buggy, there's a constant push to subscribe, and now I can't create notes without paying. There is nothing here that I use, that I can't get for free elsewhere. Goodbye Evernote; it used to be fun"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to be the new Trello. Can't accomplish a thing in the app without payment. Was just trying to make a note and couldn't. Uninstalled. May try again in another 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was such a great app for so many years. Now it's incredibly laggy, and asks you to upgrade any time you take an action on the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app with a generous free tier. Now I am spammed with multiple upgrade popups every time I open the app. Makes the app unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app from 2017. One of my best apps at that time. There's a whole bunch of lags and now I'm no longer able to create new notes. Thanks for the memories and so long farewell. I'm moving to another app. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was perfectly happy with the plus version, but now it doesn't exist anymore and I am supposed to pay 159$ a year for a simple note-taking app. That's just greed. I'll be looking for a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Commercials are getting too annoying, keeps pushing to pay for the use of the app with EVERY note you open so I started looking for different note app which is said as it was a great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using Evernote since 2016 mainly for the purpose of saving my writings. I used recommended it to everybody. But the latest updates and the limitations of saving only 50 notes in free version just ruined the experience. This is very disappointing. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Years ago it was fine, a simple note taking app. Now there are continual crashes and issues and then the developers have the gall to bombard me to pay for a subscription when they have a buggy app. Delete and install one of the many alternatives out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest release has ruined this app, now the UI is clunky and not very user friendly and you constantly get upgrade ads. Another long standing user lost. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great once, and free. Now it's horrible. Can't create new notes without paying and even accessing old notes is hampered by constant messages to get you to pay. I'm deleting this garbage app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Echoing the other recent comments on here. I've used this app for years and found it very useful, but recent changes have me looking for a new option so I can delete this app. Relentless pop up ads and note limitations have soured the experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked out of my account!!! Google disabled my email and Evernote wants me to update my password. I CANT ACCESS MY OLD EMAIL !! AND JUST LIKE GOOGLE I CANT GET NO HELP !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was a great app, but they now promote spamming users over allowing easy usage, especially in the last year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"R.I.P Evernote. Mirroring every recent review, I'm cutting loose. Holding your users responsible for your failed business model is ridiculous, especially when your bailout makes yours the most expensive app of its kind. There are way too many other free or lower cost options to play this game, especially given all the glitches."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be a great app. Developers got money hungry and made the app non functional for people that have been using it for years. They have jacked up subscription prices and limited anything below in a way that has made the app of no use unless you pay subscription pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Oh no! I missed my once in a lifetime opportunity to get it 40% off, lol. No seriously, app is basic and okay, but the offer to upgrade to premium for 40% off along with ""this offer won't be repeated"", EVERY TIME YOU LAUNCH, is laughable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I began using Evernote in 2013 when it was touted as one of the best notetaking apps there is. I used it frequently until around 2020/2021 and have amassed a good number of notes and notebooks. Recently started using it again and was surprised to find that there is now a limit of 1 notebook and 50 notes and then realised there is no way to batch delete notes or even delete notebooks in the mobile app. Was willling to explore their plans but for $15/mo I will be switching to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote loyalist (since '15!), reporting a duplicate payment nightmare. Reps gave conflicting info, felt ignored. Finally sent proof, now crickets. Seriously, @Evernote? Time to fix this mess & earn back my trust. My loyalty & money deserve better. Let's resolve this, pronto! #FixTheFiasco. I still believe in Evernote's potential. But right now, that potential feels overshadowed by confusion and neglect. Show me you value my years of loyalty, show me you care about resolving mistakes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used for last 7 years, but recently updated it will be very poor to using. I have been uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DONT BOTHER!! I have had this app for years and absolutely loved it - I used it exclusively for note taking and sharing notes with people. Now all of a sudden I've hit a note limit and have to purchase a subscription? After YEARS? With ZERO warning? Yeah, no. Hope the money grab was worth it because I'm uninstalling and no longer recommending this as a note taking app. Shame, though, because the features were great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Inundated with ads and limited to 50 notes only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aggressivly pushing for subscription service. App is becoming more and more difficult to use. Seems it has this auto feature that ""pushes"" the bullets when trying to make a list."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became an app that kinda game to escape from offers for upgrade. Evernote team, if you can not stand then close your service and quite from the market."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Farewell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"disappointed with this new limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote deactivated my 10 years old account without any reason, now I am not able to reactivate it despite having verified email and mobile number"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"none"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good an useful app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nothing is free. Nothing is working. As soon as I install taking me to payment page. Greedy app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to update to sign in. Every update makes product worse, to the point of my looking for another app to use for notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Get em used to the free version, then demand they go to a pay version for over $100 a year when their files are all there. What's the next strong arm tactic?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app since 2015 and have been well over this new ""50 notes limit"". The persistent offer screens for the last few months were very annoying but easy enough to ignore. The app now is completely unusable for me. I will not be partaking in it's cheap desperate and greedy cash grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become nothing but non stop popup ads. I'm moving all my notes off of it. A simple note taking app should not be this frustrating to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally have 18 notes and telling me I'm at Max. Constant ad to upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been using this since 2011. The new restrictions on users are very disappointing, only free the first 50 notes?? True that i have been free user, but i didnt even use all the allocated data that was given to me every month since all my notes are in texts containing ideas or whatever comes to mind. Since i cant make new notes, i have to migrate to other app now. Extra star for your services all this time, its been a good journey but the ends has left me and im sure more user dissatisfied."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"great functionality. but the request to buy the paid version, which is ridiculously expensive for a note app, pops up every day, multiple times per use. I'm ditching the app for this reason alone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until , End 2023, I think they recruited a ""smart"" CEO, Nokia, blackberry ""smart"" ceo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like it this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's sad to see the best apps become the worst apps. Charging to just be able to make notes is disgusting. I'm done"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app... Before they transformed into a greedy company. They only allow 50 notes, and require one to pay for more. I am absolutely disgusted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great for notes HOWEVER The ads for BUY PRO NOW that pop up as your trying to get your thoughts or Todo lists into a note before you forget are awful. :') Also a 50 note cap before having to pay yearly??? I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app until recently now it's restricted my amount of notes and keeps pushing me to spend 100 a year for the upgraded version. I don't want an ungraded version it worked fine for the 5+ years I've probably used it and recommended it to people"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Every time I try to use it I get multiple ads trying to get me to upgrade and pay. It takes minutes to just check my grocery list because I have to keep clicking past all the pop ups. Currently transferring all my notes from here to keepnotes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, i transferred to another notes service after using it from 2012 for 12 years.. Thanks evernote goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can't sync without an upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So. Many. Ads. I've used the free version of Evernote for over 10 years for light personal use and this last year I started to get multiple ads while using the app to upgrade to a paid subscription. It's like the app isn't remembering I've seen the ad already. It will also offer me diff rates during the same session. I get they want to advertise the paid service but this is ridiculous. I can't use it anymore due the ads badgering me to death. Are they actively trying to drive away users away??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was so very disappointed to find out the free plan wouldn't let me add any more notes after I've already wrote hundreds through the year, this was a deal breaker for me and I'll not be using Evernote any longer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to note taking app. Only used it to take my notes. And recently found out that it has been downgraded. Everytime I logged in this promotions started popping up which always says for a limited time but that's not a limited time offer. I then found notion to be a better app as it was less expensive plus unlimited notes. So will be moving to that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good apl"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is not bad, but every time I open the app I see the same add blocking the screen and I need to confirm that I'm sure that I don't want to buy it and that I won't see this offer again. But guess what? I see the same offer again every day. There's even a new year's offer overlapping the usual one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled. Because we have many note apps with the same features and now this app is limited to 1000 notes for free users. Better to migrate. Useless app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I valued Evernote that led me create multiple notebooks, 50+ notes within one, no annoying pop-ups every 10 seconds to upgrade (a free plan user since 2015), and be content on writing. Now, uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They made a Sneaky update. It used to be a great app and I had all my notes in there for a long time and now all a sudden I cant create anymore notes unless I pay a ridiculous amount of yearly membership subscription. (The way they made this change its just so sketchy and it just doesn't feel worth it to pay this for a note app). Evernote heres a suggestion- how about you include cloud storage with the subscription maybe then I'll consider to subscribe. Until then I moved to Onenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has now been hacked. Deleted evernote need to check your security someone managed to change my email address on your app. Useless. Security with this app is non existent avoid like the plague unless you want the dark web to know all your stuff. This is the VERY worse security app I have EVER had the misfortune to use. A disgraceful app that Google needs to delete from the store. Scammers that they are."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be a nice app, but now it's outdated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've organized with Evernote since 2015 for free and it worked well until this year when the Evernote decided to charge a large yearly fee (though I can retain my current info). I don't mind paying a reasonable fee for the app, but not the amount the company is charging ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"free version limiting and consistent adverts"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not good updated version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be simple and amazing. Now it's bloated and can't be opened without some sort of tip, reminder or ad to upgrade. As of 2024, they also froze free users out of creating new notes and limiting your experience to one notebook and 50 notes unless you pay $99 a year. I can still access my old notes going back until 2012, many of those years a paying customer (until last year). Evernote is in trouble and I won't be surprised if we hear about layoffs in the next year or two."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote since August 2013, over a decade. Now with this new update of 50 notes and one notebook for the free version, or buy the insanely overpriced premium yearly version, I'm calling it quits. I am grateful for the use I have gotten out of it, but not one dime will go to this price gouge of a premium plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for so many years & loved it, but same as other complaints it's waayyy to expensive now. There is no way I am paying that much for a note taking app. Now I can't even add anything else without pay such an insane amount of money. Plus I keep getting the pop-up everytime I go into to the app to buy. It is honestly one of my favorite note apps but I just can't pay that much just to use an app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""We came; we saw; we conquered bugs."" No you did not, the new version has many bugs. Every 3-4 scrolls of the main screen somehow takes the user to a blank screen. The app keeps giving messages of authentication failed, necessitating repeated sign ins. When trying to copy a word it selects the entire para. Please fix. My quote, ""It it ain't broke don't fix it' The previous version was working fine for many years but Evernote discontinued support for that version so the only option was update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every single time I open this app it prompts four times to upgrade and always says it's the last time I'll be able to get this offer. I wish it was the last time they'd offer it to me. No joke. I have declined this off for at least 200 times . 11 years using this app and loved most everything about it. Have about 400 notes. New update says I can only have a total of 50 notes and have to pay to keep it. Very disappointed. Will be moving on to try Google keep instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has basically been killing it's userbase the past year. It used to be a very easy app to use and I loved it. Now they are putting us in a chokehold to pay them to use it. I recommend looking elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, non-functional, buggy, and just a waste of my time tbh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sometimes size of letters vary and un cooperative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't wait to be rid of this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for ~10 years now. In the last month-ish the popups saying I need to upgrade have been super constant as opposed to every now and again and today I got the ""you've reached your 50 note max"" message so I deleted a few as I did a few months ago when this happened but even after deleting notes so I'm no longer at the max it won't let me add anymore. It's a shame because honestly I really enjoyed using it before but this is crazy and I'm going to switch apps it's not worth $129/yr"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'll be moving to Google Keep Notes. Evernote now limits free users to 50 notes only. So for those (like me) who have used this app since 2021, you'll be stuck trying to deleting hundreds of notes 1 by 1."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"ADIOS Evernote! You were one of my faves, always recommended it but we know now is another story..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"bring forced to pay over a hundred dollars a year is ridiculous for a note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is too limiting and bombards you with ads. Paid version is too expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wants me to pay $130 to make a note, says I've reached the note limit of 50 notes while I only have 22 notes created. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible Now ! I've used this app for Several years & LOVED IT. Now I'm only limited to 50 notes or forced to pay an astronomical amount of $$. Are you kidding??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be an amazing app but now the amount of begging for payment for premium usage is INSANE. One up front would be fine but it's every other screen. They also suddenly limit your note amount etc. This app is unusable now. Awful decision on your part."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app used to be great but is now near unusable. I cant even create a new note now. Every time I try to create a note, I get a pop up to upgrade then it diverts me back to the main page. I only have 20 current notes which is well below the 50 maximum on the free version. Will be looking for something better and more reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over 10 years. It was my favorite app for keeping text, voice and photo notes. I am forced to transfer all my notes to other app and uninstall Evernote because they restricted free accounts to only 50 notes, which is not enough for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently ruined. Forcing pay memberships on me. Can't even delete items now to get to the free level limits. Ruined a decent app. Find something else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Ive paying Evernote for over a year now. I've no issues until just recently. My notes recently aren't saving. I made a really important note I needed yesterday and moved it to another notebook, it deleted everything except the title of the note. Absolutely ridiculous. I needed that information and thought I could continue to trust Evernote to save my notes? But I guess not. Sincerely pissed. I will probably be canceling my subscription now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I need something to keep notes, usually in a rush. This app has a lot of cool features but pesters too much to buy licensing, usually when I'm opening the app trying desperately to remember something while dismissing stacks of pop-ups. I understand devs have to eat too but this method was too intrusive to the navigation to keep using the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This WAS a great app. Been using it for years. Tried to make a new note today, & it says the free version now limits you to 50 notes. No problem! Deleted a bunch of my old notes. Now I have 35, but it still won't let me make a new one. Thought about upgrading, but at $10+/mo? 🤣 Never."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2010... have written thousands of pages of content in it. I thought it could be my forever app, but had a nagging feeling that something bad would happen sometime. Now in 2024... here we are. A big monthly fee for any note additions under my circumstance. And now a fear that I'll soon have to pay for access to my decade-long reign of notes. The most I can say is - thanks Evernote for being the best app for 13 yrs, and it looks like my anticipated cutoff from it is now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Could not successfully log into the newly installed app, which claimed no Internet. (I had wifi & cell signal.) The Mac desktop experience was bad: instant & repeated pop-up ads, only one notebook (so can't test moving items between notebooks). If Evernote is trying to discourage new users, they're succeeding."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incredibly slow, clunky and unreliable. Many notes are not offline even if they show as offline and offline settings are fully enabled for all notebooks. When on the move or traveling by air it can be a HUGE problem if you rely on your notes! If a note hasn't been opened manually there is a high chance it is not saved offline. To be sure it is saved offline you have to literally open each and every note. I started to use other apps for my important notes because I can't rely on Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used Evernote for years and it was originally 5 stars. now they forced update and I have to pay for offline notes!? It's extremely slower to load notes now and I'll be in a panic If I don't have internet in emergencies. Will be forced to start looking for substitute apps now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now after 7 years of use they changed terms and its 10 bucks a month, paid in a yearly lump sum. Just to have more than 50 notes. Terrible, will be switching to new service with reasonable pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am extremely disappointed in Evernote. I have been using the free version for years and now all of a sudden I am unable to make new notes because I have reached my 50 note limit with my free version (I have 200 notes). They keep pushing you to upgrade relentlessly, and I would if the prices were more reasonable. I'm sad to say but I'll be switching to a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: After literally almost a decade of being a user with 300+ notes, I now have to abandon Evernote due to its ridiculously stupid new restrictions of 50 notes for free users. Literally just use gdocs instead lmao"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app ever that I use to take notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years, but recently it just keeps pushing ads and stops me from saving new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many ads and they have even started limiting the notes. Done with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great I've used the app for several years, now in order to continue use they insist on paying a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. I have been using this app for many years. The free version is now useless and the paid version is far too expensive. It is just for keeping notes... Handy but now a rip off.. Will be moving to another option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app for taking notes but they recently changed the free version into only allowing fifty notes. I already had way more than that beforehand so I simply can't make any new ones. It's practically worthless now. Just use Notion instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not use, over prices app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too many popups telling you to pay. if your willing to pay it seems worthwhile, but its a nuisance and not worth using free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I changed my phone and now I am unable to log in to my account, nor update Evernote nor reinstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I pay for a personal account and have zero qualms other than - colors, please! Colorful and patterned backgrounds, tabs, etc. I'm low vision and ocd. I'd put way more in it, if I could organize it. I love all the templates, btw. For haters: 'you get what you pay for'. MS365, Adobe, all other tech all have annual fees. They constantly fix bugs and update tech. They have lite versions you can buy, w/o bells/whistles."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription price increases without any new features or added value make me feel like I'm getting swindled. When I compare any streaming service to this app, the amount of money Evernote wants doesn't come close to the value those services provide for a similar price. I'd rather carry a small 50¢ notebook in my pocket than pay $10+/mo on a note taking app. I could barely get myself to pay $80/yr and now they want $130/yr. Why? What have they done to justify this price increase?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"primium seems too costly to afford for a year...rather would save it all on drive even if it's hectic..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not download it will stop you from making anymore note without paying a huge sum of money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to be a proud user of Evernote for about a decade. Even when the ads started becoming more and more obnoxious, I still stuck with Evernote because it fulfilled all my needs. But this last update was the last straw. It's completely unacceptable to take away basic features from existing users and make us pay for the bare minimum. If anyone has any alternatives, please recommend them to me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had this free app since 2011. It was great! But in the last couple of years, they ran ""upgrades"" that have made it all but useless. So many bugs! It inexplicably deleted huge sections of notes, and there's no way to retrieve previous versions. It takes forever to load, it used to take a single step to highlight a section, now it takes 5. No matter if I have my phone set to portrait, it always auto-rotates. Now they limit it to 50 notes and can't add anything without paying $130 a year!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Revising my 2015 review from 5 stars to 2 before uninstalling. Used this app from 2014 to 2024. Was great to create quick notes and stay organized. For the past year/months the prompts to pay for X and Y plans, the notes limits, the app getting slower and the bugs made me transition to a new app and copy/paste each Evernote note one by one to that new app. Farewell, old friend! You were nice until you were not."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Looking for alternate solutions. Tired of the ridiculous changes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was great, but these pop up ads are getting super annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great, simple, organize tool, and more!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Horrible horrible 😡 Definitely not worth the price. They're asking even at holiday 40% off. For very limited free version , Their ad campaign to get you to upgrade borders on harassment. Used to be a very good note Taking app not worth it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Hi thanks Only bug is : it cant sync appropriately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for several years as a bare bones note-taking app. It has been great until the last few months. They have started strong arming users into paying their overpriced subscription cost and have limited usage if you don't. I will be converting to another app as soon as I can save my existing notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Probably one of the most annoying apps ever. Constant, repeating mags about upgrading everything I try to use it. Have ditched it now for Joplin... which is free and open source. I recommend everyone look at Joplin first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad upgrade. Waste of space. Now the view of notes are very small, a with a lot of ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"have been using it for 6 years, free version, and i really adored this app. i have so many notes, thoughts, poems and stories saved in there that i feel like crying now that i can't use it anymore without buying premium (which i can't do simply cos it's impossible to do from my country). i'm very heartbroken, but i guess i have to move to another app like other dedicated users do"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The best app that keeps up with your notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be fantastic, but now it constantly asks you to upgrade to premium every time I use the app. This doesn't make me want to pay, it makes me want to use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using this for years and I have been more than happy with this app. I have many folders with all of my information and my husband is able to log in and get any information that he requires on his phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You know it really deserves a five star because the product is really good. Very very upset that you have reduced our notebooks to ONE for the free app. That's ridiculous guess I have to move somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Fine and beautiful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Now limited plan, only 50 entries. Your application does not deserve any payment, I wish you to go bankrupt soon, useless and incompetent developers with a degrading product! You are a disgrace to the industry!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable after the new limits they set and it's really expensive when there is other no cost options"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I bought this app and paid in full at 2018. Haven't used it for a few years. Opened it today and it is asking me to pay again or I can't use it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook now, pretty lame that it's so paywalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The number of times the app popped up an ad for their paid version made me uninstall this app and never want to use one of their products again. It popped up every time I opened an existing note. It's completely awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Takes quite a while to load notes and there are too many high-pressure pop up ads to go premium. At least two each time I open the app. How many times is it necessary to tell this app I don't want to go premium? It's annoying enough that I'll likely switch to another note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst Application for Notes. Evernote has single handedly made themselevs the worst app out there for taking notes. No longer supports multiple devices and now limits you to one notebook and 50 notes. This is to push you to pay the premium prices which are too high to justify staying with them. Fact is, theres better apps out there for this kind of thing now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I purchased the ""lifetime"" side of this app when I first installed it. Now they are saying I need to pay $130 to ""upgrade"" in order to continue using their services (I have 18 notes, total). DO NOT PAY FOR THIS APP. I hope this is a glitch I. Their system and not the standard of their business. Please recommend a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash note app. Use to be good. Came here to say this and thankfully I'm not the only one. Used this app for many years. It's pretty much unusable now. They ask you to upgrade multiple times, everytime you open the app. And the price they are asking for is outrageous! It's a dam phone app. I understand it has use on computers but then come up with a price for mobile usage. Like $160 a year is ridiculous. Y'all need to get your heads on straight. It's a note app. Don't install!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Oke"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's used to be free, but now they charge an insane amount of price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ABSOLUTE SCAM App WAS amazing until they removed the free option without warning, pressuring you to buy a subscription. Now it's a joke."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It app very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Popups every time you open it to upsell you, dramatic cutting of features between the free and paid version and much higher pricing all of a sudden. Feels like a bait and switch. Poor user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using since 2010 and the new business model (2024) has basically removed functionality for 'free' usage, whilst costing upwards of €50/yr for a subscription. If you are just taking simple notes or using as a list creator it simply isn't worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I m (was) Evernote user since they launched, has been premium user for long while, its just unacceptable all of a sudden you guys changed all the plans no matter how old the users are and lock them out of notebooks and then bombarding them, literally with premium offers in every click! Turns out many free ones without this hassle and its not that hard to switch to another note app anyway. and its just so satisfying to see similar comments. Shame on you. Extra star for the very long time i used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fed up of the constant interruptions from popups pushing me to upgrade. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extreme price hikes combined with selling my data without my permission and no way to opt out mean I'm done with this parasitic app. It was good while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bombarded with instrusive self-promotion. I had to tell the app no 3 times only to back out, only to click on a different element that prompted more promotions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Haven't used this since 2014 and I can't because of errors. Nowhere to create account or link to Google, so therefore it doesn't work. Nothing wrong with my Google password, so I'm not going to reset it. Fix your app or I'll find something else. Account not linked Account is not linked to Google, please log in with your Email & Password instead. - So when I do, it shows: Error Your password has expired, please reset it now by tapping on ""Forgot password"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Lowering my rating because of cost. This company really need to do their homework. Other companies like this don't charge a 3rd of what this company is charging. What will happen, you will price yourself out the game, trust me. I haven't had any issues with the app or this, I also love evernote, and will raise my rating, if they can lower the price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for about 5-6 years. I have countless pieces of work in the app. Now there's a note limit. And 15 dollars to take it away? I'm okay. The world will make everything about money. Trash. Forced to find another outlet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app now. The ads are so infuriating and they pop up non stop. I will transition from the app and never get it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very weak move getting people to limit to 25 notes. Had to delete 3 years of notes. Old accounts should have been grandfathered with all the existing notes . Who works with 25 notes . So dumb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's so close to being great. It has awesome features and is really useful, yet... syncing problems occur ALL THE TIME and I keep losing my work! Get it together, Evernote! UPDATE: I'm officially done with this app. It's performance has consistently gotten WORSE over the last year - slower to load, full of popup ads, worse at syncing across devices, and the most aggravating at all, the free version has been severely limited to force you to buy their premium plan. Nope. Join me on Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It was and can be a great way to organize notes, but if you don't pay the premium monthly then they keep bugging you every time you log in and suddenly glitches start."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cash grab"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To those of you who find yourselves held hostage by Evernote I recommend JOPLIN, an open source notes app that is supported by the community and will not demand that you pay to upgrade or you cannot add any more notes. Hooray for JOPLIN, evernote you can go pound sand!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank u for ruining one of the best apps I use since 2012 across different platforms, losing a loyal customer! The app is forcing us gradually for the past 2 years to upgrade & pay a large premium amount to be able to use easily.. First of all, only 2 devices logged, limited offline access .. Now, limiting us to have only 50 notes, & the existing notes can't be moved to another notebook.. Seeing the upgrade pop up a zillion times during use .. Quitting so soon, just looking for an alternative 😕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used Evernote for years and have hundreds of notes only to be told without notice, an email, ANYTHING that I either pay up or I can't make any more notes is ridiculous. I don't know about anyone else but I received no heads up that plans were changing along with pricing. Now it's like a pay to play game except I know how this game ends. I pay more & more for a subscription as time goes on for the EXACT SAME SERVICES I've been using for years. No thanks. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly the app is effectively useless unless I upgrade to the paid version? 50 notes total, are you kidding me? I never would have started using this app if I had been told that the free version was going to become so limited. Now looking for options to migrate my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great (maybe even the best), but now it's been watered down, limited, and has a popup like every 5 seconds telling you to buy a premium plan. Shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly harassing you to pay for premium Now they announced a limit of notes you can have. And only 2 devices? Yeah I'm out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a shame everything is locked behind a pay wall at this point. I've used this app for 8 years but I think it's time for me to move on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, free version worked well and did plenty, but suddenly everything was put behind a massive paywall and it just wouldn't let you do anything without telling you to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for my subscription on December 26,2023 and the money was taken from my Act but i still can't get into evernote for my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"test it now :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have introduced a 50 NOTE LIMIT. You have to PAY MONTHLY to have more notes than that. Please reverse this terrible change and I will adjust my review. Used this app for many years and am shocked that they thought this was a good idea. Shameless money grab. They already had so many features behind a paywall. Now they reduced the free version to garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute trash of an app. ANYTHING YOU DO will prompt a plan for you to buy! That you have to ""ACT NOW OR YOU'LL MISS OUT"", but has been the case for a year now. Curently copying out my important notes and deleting the rest. Plenty of free app options to type up some notes on your phone. Oh and it's wonderful how when I delete the note, the app freezes and I have to try again. Charging someone for a note taking app with features that offer you nothing is ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are you serious? Why'd you make it so expensive? This app has completely gone down hill I'm absolutely not going to spend $120+ to take notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps making the experience worse for free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was forced to upgrade Evernote just to log in which I thought was a bit strange, but now I see why. I was immediately met with a convoluted interface with too many options and ads everywhere, and a notification that I can only have 1 notebook and 50 notes unless I pay for a plan. Absolutely ridiculous, will be switching to another note keeping app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a paid member via Google play store and the same is not reflecting in the application. The app keeps asking me to upgrade and limits my use despite being a paid member"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Dear Evernote Team, I am paid subscriber, facing so many issues while syncing, as their is no manual sync option, please update the same.. much needed option, please.. Regards"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It was supper good use but it's seems the new anual price not good anymore. I will look for anothey way of transfering data to a new app. Ms note or onenote........"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why not just use ads? Taking away major features that've always been free, to put behind a subscription fee, isn't right. Good apps add new features to entice people to pay for more, not take them away. I get wanting money, but why not use ads? Reducing the free plan to only 50 notes with 25mb storage each is measly, when we've always been allowed as many notes and notebooks as we wanted. I started using this app 10 years ago for the syncopation, and that it was free. Now I'll have to archive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote daily for over 10 years. I didn't even complain when they slowly but surely removed features over the years and stripped away what was included with different tiers of service. I was thanked the weekend of Christmas 2023 by unannounced changes. I could no longer use their services the way I had been using it without paying a much higher fee. They obviously don't value their customers and just look at us as cash cows they can milk. Permanently lost my patronage. Good luck you!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Since 2015 using this app but now i cannot access to my old notes! Whats wrong? Please solve this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely useless now. 1 notebook and 50 notes is a joke, and the $129 paywall to have the app go back to the way it was feels like they're spitting in our face"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No longer works. Most interested in pushing paid tiers, when trying to share to Evernote on Android now, it just crashes. There are better alternatives now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The Android back button/gesture is finally working properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's time to say goodbye and uninstall this app. I've used it since my first phone, but now they've limited the number of notes (50 notes), and I can't even use the app or delete old notes to make room for new ones, as I've reached the ""free"" note limit. The rates are too expensive. It's unfortunate, considering I've had this note app for years, and I can't even view most of my old notes due to constant premium offers that can't be exited, they only redirecting me to the home page..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This has been my primary note taking app for 10 years. TEN YEARS. Since the recent update, I'm out of note space so I must pay an exorbitant monthly fee to continue using. Except I can't afford it, so I guess this is goodbye. I wish they were offering a more affordable option. Pretty good app, I just can't get over the price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was recently acquired by a new company, and it shows - they recently capped all free users to 50 notes and 1 notebook, which makes the app practically unusable for long-time free users. To add insult to injury they nag you to buy a pricey subscription every time you open the app or try to use any feature, with full screen pop-ups that are intentionally difficult to close. The new company clearly treats Evernote like a cash cow and wants to milk it dry. Shame, will be switching apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be my favorite notes app until the last update. I have like 7 notebooks and 100+ notes made and NOW you're trying to limit me to 1 notebook and 50 notes or make me pay $120+ a year????? No thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's been very good for long time. But now a days forcing me to upgrade for every single click. Getting frustrated whenever i open the app. It is not allowing me to do any operation without showing upgrade banner"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was my go to...until the 50 notes cap to force users to pay....worst thing is I only have 10 notes and unable to add more via my device. No issues on web. They really screwed up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I originally rated Evernote 5/5, but recently they have been pushing their paid version to the point where I can no longer make new notes. The price point for their yearly subscription ($159!!) is extremely high. There should be a less expensive option for basic use. I only use the app for storing recipes, I am not a business using this to connect team members or all the other fancy things this app can do. Really disappointed there isn't an option that suits my needs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote pretty much since it launched, I went from a paid user to using the free version to back to using the paid (professional) version again. Their recently announcing raising their prices by over 150% was the straw that broke the camels back. Price was high for the app considering the issues but nothing warrants this increase. Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good. It's garbage now and the limits on the free program make it useless. Going back to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this since 2012 to save recipes, and now the amount they want to charge is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. Maybe if I used for more stuff, I would consider it. Given how many ppl have given them 1 star, I'm sure they are not really 4 stars anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am considering to cancel my subscription. Came over from Google Keep. Instead of finding a more superior app, what I was constantly dealing with was app crashes, every time I open, or even attempt to see my note. Then cannot login via Google Login no more till I have to change password on Evernote for no reason. Their support team was the slowest ever to response. Imagine you keeping important notes inside Evernote only to be face with such issue that almost render the app impossible to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Has been using it since 2012"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I haven't been able to use this app effectively for well over a year. Ever since the developers have gone rabid with rent seeking behavior. Between adding glitchy features no one asked for and repeatedly interrupting use of the app to beg for money, I've only ended up struggling to use Evernote bc ive had it for 8~9 years. Old habits die hard. Now you can only have 50 notes, I have hundreds of notes. Poems, old memories. All of it behind a paywall. Evernote deserves to fail."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nice limits for free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"At begining was a great app. I want to read old anotations, but doesn't work. I tried wifi and mobile data, no good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the free version of this app since 2017, l've been faithful to it and I always used to recommend it to other writers. Until recently, when I tried to write a note, and it told me that I had reached ""the limit"" of notes. That I needed to upgrade and pay a sizeable amount of money if I wanted to continue using the app. There has not been a limit for notes before. In which case, I have no choice but to change apps. I'll be sad to see Evernote go."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Withdrawing use because of 50 note limit. I have been an occasional user of free Evernote for many years and have accumulated about 200 notes. Now evernote have made it impossible for me to add further notes, so my only choices are either to pay a subscription (which I cannot justify) or transfer to another tool. Since I already pay a Microsoft annual subscription, I will go to OneNote. Even though I prefer the EN UI. I just need to work out how to transfer my existing notes to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app changes, it now limit the number of notes to 50. Very disappointing, it has become useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over 10 years and found it a very useful means of storing documents. More recently, I've been increasingly irritated by the frequent popups pushing subscriptions. I might have paid a modest subscription for minor enhancements over the free version, but the upgrade contained unneeded features and was absurdly expensive. The final straw has been the restriction to 50 notes. I've deleted my data. Evernote, come up with a decent offering and I might return."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Degrading performance makes this less useful every year"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now it's says only 50 notes. Still trying to steal my money. It's never gonna happen. There are many free products with no limits."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app, now suddenly you can't make more than 50 notes. Me having more than that already, makes it impossible to move notes from one book to another. I wouldn't mind paying for premium if it wasn't so god damn expensive, 100€ a year? Not even Netflix is that pricy! I could have even lived with ads in the app if money was an issue but actually we DO have ads as you get pestered by the get premium now screen EVERY SINGLE DAMN TIME YOU OPEN A NOTE. I'll be looking for a dif app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Now only lets you have 50 notebooks ever. Even when you delete old ones, you still can't create new ones unless you pay the insane $130/year subscription. App is basically useless to me now. Don't even start using this app because it will only be useful for so long until they demand money. Plenty of other note apps do the same things as them for free. Find another one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I pay extra for premium. Now I keep getting ads to pay for a different level, even though I say no."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always trying to get you to purchase it's yearly.... worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app and used it for 10+ years. I love lists & it kept me organized, so the free version was great. I could deal with the constant pop-ups, asking me to upgrade. But then came the note limit. I have 13 notes, but am unable to create more. Apparently, more than 50 notes were *created* over the course of 10+ years. Even though I deleted lists when they were done, the deleted notes work against me. Super disappointed that I can no longer create notes. Looking for a new list app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm adding my 2 cents. I've used Evernote for at least 10 years, but $140/ year for a notetaking app is too much for the casual user like me. I would consider paying, but this is too much for my needs. I add less than 5 notes a month. I hope you reconsider your business plan. This seems like a missed opportunity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version of this app is absolutely unusable because of the app is asking for money for every single function. So there basically is no free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, buggy and constantly asking to upgrade to paid plan. It's a sad ending for what used to be a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really starting to dislike the UX of this app. On mobile I am rarely actually taking notes, so whenever I tap within a note to highlight and copy text, it thinks I want to edit the note. No! If I want to edit the note I'll press the edit button to go into edit mode. Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I would really prefer to go into dedicated edit mode vs accidentally tapping the note and risk deleting important info without knowing. App is constantly bloated w/ full screen ads for premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now we have to pay for notes .. dont download guys .. too many ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"At last, we're finishing at the point of squeezing my money to store kilobytes of text like ""you'll be able to upload 10 gb per month!"" Come on - I'm not about to use the notes service as my cloud storage for 100 euros per year! Then you're limiting me with only one notebook and 50 notes. So, good bye and no good luck to blackmailers like you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really difficult to cancel suscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used the free version of Evernote for several years as a way of keeping track of business cards, notes from classes and meetings, and general brainstorming. Over time, features and access have continued to be scaled back for free users, and the pop up ads for paid accounts are pretty relentless. Given the most recent changes (effective 12/23) limiting the number of notes available for free users, I'm finally done. This app used to be helpful. Now it just sucks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 1/8/24 Deleted all my notes and closed my account. I was a member since 6/22/13 and you destroyed this once reliable app with your greed. Honestly come on smh. I've moved to Google Keep. --- Old review: Free version asks you if you want to upgrade and forces you into a second confirmation screen everytime. Even if you click ""I don't want this offer"", it returns everyday. They've constantly stripped featured from the free version for the last 3-5 years and are trying to force an upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free plan used to be OK. A lot of basic functionality was blocked behind a paywall, but it did what I wanted - stored notes in the cloud in a structured way, similar to Microsoft OneNote. That's all I needed. Now they limit free users to 50 notes total, so I had to suddenly find another app to take notes. Every time I open the app now it gives multiple intrusive popups advertising the paid EIGHTY POUNDS PER YEAR subscription. For a note taking app. Use any other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rubbish app. Keep asking for money. Not in hundreds but in thousand. Have you lost it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst note taking app in history. Plus, it says free but it's not. And it can't be used without account. Couldn't be worse even if they tried really hard."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This WAS the winner of note taking apps. But now the free version is limited to 1 notebook and max 50 notes. This makes the Evernote useless for your every day notes and for personal use. So, I am searching for an free alternative. Besides of the limitation of the free version, this app is the benchmark on the market, with many features and cloud synchronisation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother installing this app it's trash. The app is boring and doesn't offer anything worth paying for they keep taking away the few things that made it a decent free app. The lowering notes to 50 made me uninstall. the first note app installed afterwards was free and much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app once upon a time, had been a member since 2014. All these price changes, poor app updates and quality, and absolutely atrocious customer services. Have officially deactivated and deleted this app. Ridiculous I work up one day couldn't work of my stories and documents I've had for ten years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They charged me for a yearly subscription, then it was not upgraded, and there is no way to get support to fix it (for 3 weeks they have a link saying they are working on improving it (clearly misleading, as they just don't have it)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was one of my favourite apps but why do you have to keep changing everything. After last update it keeps crashing - extremely disappointed 🙁 2024 update...now I can't have more than 50 notes without paying an over inflated monthly fee. That's the last straw. Shame you have become so greedy. I have always recommended this app to others but wont anymore. Looking elsewhere for something better 🙁"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Be careful - All my data wiped"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a piece of RIP-OFF JUNK! The app is buggy. Okay functionality on the ""free"" version. If they'd ask a reasonable price, I might buy the app, but these idiots want to sell it as a SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE! It costs more than some of my streaming services. Pops up constantly with ""great"" offer. Many features are unavailable on the free version. Only 40 notes max. This thing only exists to squeeze money out of you. Not worth it. Recommend you get Joplin instead and avoid this scam."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Been using Evernote for the past 11 years for free. Always reliable and easy to use. Was a good run. Moving all my notes to Google Keep. I'm not paying $130+ tax a year to take notes on my phone. My guess is very few people will. Best of luck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Use a different notepad app. This shows a pop-up ad every time you open it, and you have to click twice to dismiss it. It's infuriating for such a basic app to do that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling - blocking me from creating a new note, even a locally saved one, is garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A textbook example of how to make a very good app goes downhill for a few extra bucks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App was good until they started charging for having more than one note. Might as well start looking for another app to take note with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was better a few years ago. Now they just want $$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for longer than I can remember. I use it to write all of my songs and organize them which it does great in my opinion. However, while I could tell you all the things I love about it I'll just tell you the only reason to find an alternative. That reason is the $176 dollar yearly subscription they have finally forced on us. While I would mind paying a yearly fee cause I do use the app alot $176 is grossly overpriced. Currently searching for an alternative myself…."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Woah! Suddenly not free at all? No warnings either, so disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What everybody else already said—devs now charge for ish that users used to be able to do for free on this app. Even if it was only 10$ a year for this ""service"", I still would want nothing to do with it when we already have to pay over a thousand dollars just for the devices we want to use these sorts of apps on. They think they can charge 130(!!)$ a year for this BS? Lol. What a time we're living in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, it's safe to say that this app is coming to an end. The limit amount for notes is 50 for the free version. I have 18 notes in total. The app will not let me create any more free notes. I am stuck at 18 free notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is getting worse every day, the app that previously had options for free and paid use, now only the paid one remains."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app has a lot of really useful features that I've used regularly over the years. Unfortunately it has been very slow recently and sometimes doesn't save notes when I think it has. I would definitely pay to use the upgraded version if it was cheaper and didn't have these issues. Right now the price seems a bit unreasonable for what I use the app for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How on earth I can reach out to you guys? For a complain? You charging a premium but no point of contact to reach out mentioned in your refund policy either process of refund? Its a shame to mentioned the evernote i've been using since 2015, falls to this type a tragedy. Ans all the users who ever usinh this for your personal note keep that in mind your notes are not safe, and they are exposed !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had evernote for a long time. I used it often and really thought it was an efficient app for what I needed. I mainly used it for fitness routines. Over the past several months, the app started prompting me after every single movement I made in it to purchase upgrades to the service. Now, I can no longer add notes or notebooks without purchasing a plan. Some apps are meant to stay free. Make your money by advertising if you really need that to make money. I'll be deleting it today. Good job."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has gone downhill because they are so desperate for money. If the price was anywhere near reasonable I'd upgrade but they are way out of touch on what apps like this are worth."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow! I can't even use it now. After my subscription expires, I can't do anything with it! Uninstaller real soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I now have to pay if I want more notes or Journals. Another app pulling back on features to get you to pay to their ridiculous fees. Even 50% off is too much for a note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep cutting down features for free users almost making it unusable. Earlier you could use the app from only 2 devices but could access the Web version from any number of devices. Now the Web version counts towards the limit. Now they have limited the number of notes as well. That its. Off to other note apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So annoying. Pop-up ads everywhere. Avoid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All it has to do is save notes. Every time I open it, it first takes a good 10 seconds to actually open, then it pesters me with a 40% off premium offer I don't want (the x button is usually occluded by the ad styling), then it often fails to open any notes before I close and re-open. This is an app that only has to save a few lines of text. The bar is so low and yet it fails to meet it. Any alternative is preferable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like this already. feels good for my sporadic brain"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Here's the double fisted digitus medius to Evernote. They used to be my favorite notes app, but no more! Remember who said, Be fearful when others are greedy... 🤬"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started 2012... Ended 2024 / 50 notes for free? You hate your users do you? When I first started using it it was nice , easy and simple. I didn't need much just a place for notes in the cloud with good organizing options. Coming up with unnecessary stuff, not fixing old issues, constant harassment to upgrade at every step while using. Price ridiculous for a note app plus being an endless subscription. What killed it for me. A new limit of 50 notes to make sure you forced into upgrading..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely annoying seeing prompt to upgrade the app every time you open any note. Changing the free plan to more restrictive terms for existing clients is very bad business! Will be migrating all my notes to another app and uninstalling Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"gotta pay weekly or yearly🤔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Freemium not worth it. I used to love this app but their desperation to get you to buy the premium is beyond silly, every tap you get pop up after pop up and is not like you're getting more than a glorified note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm really disappointed to see how commercial Evernote has fallen. People, incpuding myself since 2017, chose this app because of it's simplicity and ease. Lately however the creator's have opted for hyperfunctionality and commercialism. A new layout? Whatever. Decreasing the amount of platforms I can use? Fine. Sending me a pop-up ad for ""premium"" in the middle of writing? Jesus Christ. You guys need to think of your next moves very carefully before me and other writers switch better platforms"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes max? Moving over to onenote! The cash grab will lose you a lot of customers. Might have been willing to pay one time fee but no to subscription when there are other apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I really like this app and have been using for personal (not business) it since 2011. However, even though I am not at the limit of 50 notes, I keep getting the message that I can't create a new note unless I upgrade to a paid subscription. Is this a bug? I'd like to keep using the free version understanding the account limits. Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ok features but borderline unusable due to ads for premium. To open up a single note I have to dismiss four pop ups. I get one pop up ad when I open the app, another when I click on a note, and both ads trigger a second pop up when you try to close them asking you to confirm you really don't want premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I enjoyed this Application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using the free version of the all for years then recently told me I was at my note limit. I deleted notes and it says I still can't make new ones or transfer notes. Very odd that this app now badgers me with 'once in a lifetime' discounts when the app regularly glitches and Crashes as is"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very nice app. Best in all aspects. Love it. Use it only daily basis"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. Downgrading my review from 2013 of 5 stars to 1. The annoying ""offers"" for their premium subscription have become too much. They're like popups from the early 2000's, having to close and confirm 2 and 3 of them before getting to type or review a note. Stopped allowing new notes to be made so I deleted dozens of old junk ones to get under their limit of 50. I have 18 now and it's still blocking the creation of new notes. Will transfer notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 7/1/24: Greedy and annoying ads constantly asking u to pay pay pay! I'm a light user and would be more than willing to do a one off payment. Not hundreds a year! Old Review Yr 2021: Missing the old functional widgets with new update! I used the 5x2 widget which allowed me to access the notes I want in the order I wanted it. Now the widget offered is absolutely useless..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New free experience is abysmal. I managed to get by under the limit but a bug decided I still needed to pay to create any new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Dear Evernote, please offer us reasonable fee or reduce this upgrade ads. We can't use application anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is becoming more and more annoying with their aggresive campaing of making you subscribe. Considering removing the app altogether, better options out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"there taking account verification amount but i am using normally note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used free version of Evernote for over 5 years. Loved it. Simple functionality, one login on computer, one on phone was all i needed for simple notes: checklists, grocery lists, to do's, expenses,.... I had no use to upgrade to paying version. On recent trip, turns out taking offline notes is no longer possible without upgrading, really..?? Conflicting copies while working on a single device with poor internet connection, really..?? Ditched immediately and switched to Google Keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excelent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Andoroid upgrade payment doesn't works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unannounced cap to 50 notes and 1 notebook was the final straw. I had 2 dozen notebooks and just under 100 notes. Even if I was willing to pay the insane price of $159, nowhere does it show how many notes/notebooks you get, just storage size. I've been a user since 2013. It started with small things, they took away widgets I liked, then really aggressive ads every time the app was opened, lagging issues. Now, after a decade, they roll it back to 50 notes? I'm gone. Other free apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote to store a LOT of valuable images. Now the app won't/can't render any of these images. I can't even take screenshots of the thumbnails because of privacy settings on the app. All that digital property, GONE! I do NOT recommend this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"nonstop ads about their paid version as of late. Was great before they started doing that. Swapping to a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unless you're going to pay, the constant adds are extremely annoying. Even just for trying to do simple notes. Look elsewhere if you're not going to buy into their subscription plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote CONSTANTLY asks to be upgraded. It never used to do that, its incredibly annoying. I just got asked 3 times in a row before getting to my note. Definitely don't use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am tired of rejecting your paid version ""offers"". Switching to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update: performance has really gone downhill recently. Reloads often, sometimes won't load several times in a row when I try to open it. At the same time EverNote reduced functionality for free users and started aggressively promoting their new paid plan. Not happy with them right now. Love this app, it has helped me to organize my thoughts so much! I use it almost every day and keep getting more value out of it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Now is useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Moved to OneNote. It is too much to pay 'just for my small personal notes'. And advertisement each app open is annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user for as long as I can remember. It's been great until they decided to introduce the 1 notebook and 50 note limit for free users. Not a big deal and it's generous still. The problem I have is that even though I only have 1 notebook and 18 notes, I'm still prompted to upgrade as I'm ""over the limit"". This bug is really irritating and it's been a while since this update on the limit. Being forced to look for alternatives now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and loved it. I was recently told that I've reached my limit of notes and needed to pay $120 A YEAR. Being that I'm a reasonable person and know that $120 a year for a note taking app is absolutely ridiculous, I accepted the fact I reached my limit and started deleting notes and also emptied my trash of at least 250 notes to only still be told I have reached my limit. Needless to say I'm absolutely done with Evernote for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for nearly a decade but the constant offers to upgrade with the are you sure you dont want to and up to 3 at a time...migrated allll my notes (exceeding new limits) to one note. at least it doesnt harass me to upgrade for more than 50 notes when i only have 23!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly this app won't allow me to create any new notes, even though I'm well under the limit of free tier. The prompt to enroll in subscription pops up with literally any action you do on this app. I've been using Evernote for years, and this aggressive subscription bait isn't helping customers at all. Time to switch to another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Latest version almost unusable, nags on every use for $130. Cannot make a new note, even tho I deleted 140 and am down to 17. I have mostly switched to Google Keep, which is fine for plain text notes, and new features are coming"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Shite - not working properly on Pixel Pro 8, can't create a new note (screen goes blank). I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I love it!! New update here. I've been using this app off and on for a long time now. I think the Gallaxy S2 had just come out and I loved it from the start. But now it seems to be able to keep up with everything. You have to be willing to spend the money on it and it doesn't seem to be cheap either. Really is a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Started out as a great app but then they severely limited what you can do with the free version. Can't even move my notes to comply with the requirements for the free version so the app essentially locked down unless I pay for a plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years, but now I have to transfer hundreds of notes because the original Evernote owners got bought out, and the company that bought them is charging too much. I think a warning would've been nice, but it's all good. I guess nothing good last forever right 🤷🏾‍♂️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's laggy, but that doesn't bother me too much using the free version. It gets one star because of the constant pop-ups trying to sell the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Corporate greed ruined this app, if I could vote lower than 1 star for their new paywall restrictions I would. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has turned into a dystopian corporate wasteland. It used to be I could pay a few dollars a month and have a reasonable number of text based notes. Them I was forced to a $15 a month plan (375%) against my will with no option to downgrade to a more reasonable one. When I reverted to being a free user, I was coerced into deleting most of my notes. But the worst is that I literally cannot open a single note on the Android app now without clicking past FOUR different harassing upgrade messages! 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used Evernote for 10 years, since 2014. So yes, I can absolutely recommend it. But! I have to add the caveat now that you have to pay for it. I used the paid version periodically throughout that, but their recent change made the free version not conducive for my needs. The free version also hounds you constantly to upgrade, even while trying to quickly, casually add a stray thought. So if you can pay for it, it's one of the best notetaking apps out there. If not, the free version is a hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The App recently lost ALL Value by being capped at ONE NOTE BOOK, with a total of 50 NOTES unless you pay the astronomical charge of $130 to use it for a year. (Can't even own it for that much, it's a yearly cost) I was a dedicated user since 2015. Avoid this app at ALL COSTS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote started as a great app. Easy note-taking and organizing, and if you wished, you could pay a little extra for some premium features. Now it is a money grabbing scam! From constant pop-ups and subscription emails to basic essential features that used to be free and now are behid a pay wall. Prices 70, 90 euros per year are insane for notekeeping. I can not even compare the pricing to other apps. My phone provider, netflix, and spotify if I add them up it will equal Evernote. Insanity!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Nice app, but too expensive. Now as they limited the number of notes to 50 and of notebooks to 1, I'm saying goodbye to it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"constant ads - the limited notes - no"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recommend the Evernote team/founders to immediately revoke their recent changes. Like seriously. Not because I am not able to use the app, but because it will be a better business decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After recent changes app requires to have a subscription to create more than 50 notes. I have 40 but app doesn't allow me to create a new note. So it is almost useless app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for a long time with lots of folders and notes, But now I need to pay to use it. Because free version only allows 1 folder 50 notes. They could have placed higher limits. Not happy with this and moving on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant bugs. Every time I open the app, there's a difficult to close popup about a limited time offer. And the app ignores screen rotation settings. Just an overall poor experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The updates made the functions worse and made me decide to cut the subscription. Now with their decision to cut the users to 1 notebook (50 notes) for free plan, i bid to say Goodbye evernote. Thanks by the way for the 12 years! Hello to your bro ZOHO NOTEBOOK!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their pricing seems absurd. The entire MS Office costs $69.99 annually."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been using this app since 2015. I have 31 notes and it says I can't make another note because the limit is 50. They want me to pay $129.99 just to make a 32nd note. bad app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lately the app has started to work very poorly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2018 for free. Every year, the changes on app have cause its performance become slow. With increasing no. of ads popup to subscribe the app service everytime I open my notes, it is really annoying. I wish to purchase your service, but it is too expensive in my country. Your subscription price is equal to my netflix subsription which I didnt use much unless needed. So, for this 2024 GOODBYE Evernote. I just go back to using my phone free notes. Btw..Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this for years, but now I'm happily migrating. The paywall was the last thread."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become a nightmare to use. 50 notes for the free version?? are you serious? The hilarious part is even after deleting notes you can't create a new one.. Should we talk about the price? $99/year. If this isn't a robbery I don't know what it is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pretty terrible the last little while, since the company was purchased. The ads that pop up to beg you to upgrade to the paid version make both the app and web version almost completely unusable. The paid version is way too expensive to ever consider upgrading. There are other cheaper apps that do the same thing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was starting to get really annoyed with this app... not only was I getting ""limited time offers"" every time I opened the app and often while using it too, I received a notice in December that I had reached my limit for the year. I decided to download a new note app and try to copy and paste my notes into the new program, but this app appears to be disabling this function. Awful, awful app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Seriously considering Notion, this used to be good but not anymore, you get bombarded with the request to upgrade every time you open the app, and when you say no it asks if you're sure, exit the app and enter again, same deal, also the screen real estate is always filled with bars pushing you to upgrade, I just want to keep notes damn it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant spam to upgrade. Can only have one notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They added a paywall, stating you can have up to 50 notes free, but I only have 7 and it won't let me add more. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Looks like this app has gone down the drain now, they've been pushing their paid services to where you can only have 50 notes anymore which is fair and fine but even when you end up deleting notes to get you under 50 they still want you to get a subscription so you can't make anymore notes so I guess it's just busted now, shame I've been using this app for years but time to jump ship."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"They obviously don't want free users on here now, so I will be using my Google account for my notes from now on. I don't create enough notes to warrant paying for the premium package."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too few notes available in the free plan. I won't use the app anymore. Basically it s no more free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over $120 / yr to use this APP! Full of GLITCHES too!! Free version says you get 50 notes max. I have only 38 notes and it keeps saying I have 50 and tries to make me choose the pricey subscription. I even emptied the ""trash"" bin incase that was the problem. It wasn't. I also wanted to use my stylus and do a handwritten note. Every 2 letters I try to write, and the APP was glitching and only writing a few letters. Feedback link in APP does nothing either. Lots of problems here..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Run...don't walk...run away from this app! I just got hit with a resubscribe of a whopping 129.99 with no warning (literally up double from the previous year with no new abilities). I checked my email--nope, no communication from Evernote since last year's resub notice of 69.99...and they were pushing the expense then! Forget it. I've been using Evernote off and on for over a decade but this little bait and switch stuff is too much. (I literally feel like I've just had someone steal my wallet.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yet another app to succumb to greed and mind-boggling subscription costs that are in no way sensible in terms of cost/value for the services provided."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: I was okay when they put having more than two devices behind a paywall and switched to this bad graphical user interface. But now every time I open the app there's this huge ad for their premium that I have to click out of to go to my notes. Great aside from the fact that it randomly deletes my progress on notes sometimes. I tried paying for premium to get my progress back via automated backup but that was a waste of money. Aside from that and a few other bugs I've loved it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I cannot create a new note because it says my plan is limited to 50, but I only have 13 notes?? Also no way to contact support about it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sadly time has arrived for me to switch app. Been loyal for 10 years but now couldn't tolerate the slow nature of the app making it unnecessarily difficult to navigate around. I'm flabbergasted how they came up with the idea of limitation to 1 notebook and 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the perfect note taking app. Now I get nagged far too often and can't add any additional notes. Exported all my notes and switched to Simplenote which works perfectly and is much more lightweight. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I see a sinking ship!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: 10 years ago I gave this app five stars. Now it's unbearable to use due to the note restrictions and upgrade spam every time you open the app. They want $130 per year.... for a note taking app. Time to find a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was good, now my notes disappear. I've been using since 2013. Always with premium. Have multiples devices connected and am a hard user in all of them. But the syncing is terrible at a point where is hard to keep tracking of what you deleted or edited, also my most used note disappeared. To finish its been performing very poorly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant, full screen ads are why I'm going to stop using this app. used to be great but now it's terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I love this app for all the features that it has like what type of note you'd like to create and it was very inspiring to say the least. But now they are charging a hefty fee for something I don't necessarily use everyday but will need for some productivity. I can't pay $122 something for a year if I'm iffy about using it all the time. Maybe a smaller fee would help those of us that use it here and there. Now I'm limited to one notebook and I had over 54 so I can't write a single new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute garbage. Infuriatingly slow. Switch to Google keep notes and get on with your life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly pushing ads to upgrade. takes forever to load my notes (so I can copy and move them to a different app) but the ads don't seem to suffer from the same issue. RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awesome app I love it !! I like the Auto upload online backup so I don't ever lose anything. Super easy to use and the multiple notebooks comes in very handy! Well after using this app for 10years now for personal use it's no longer free, and the price they want now is absurd! Moved all the notes I've saved over a decade and deleted every note on this app and uninstalling.. look elsewhere for a good note app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's  great. Like frosted flakes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good overall app. Very professional UPDATE : Today is Friday January 5, 2024 my original Review of this app was back 2013 when I gave it 4 stars. My my how a decade or so can change ones opinion about an app. I honestly don't even waste my time using this App anymore due to the simple fact that it's not reliable whatsoever anymore. At least that's my opinion of the android version of the app. There are so many other apps out currently that are on a completely different ( better ) level."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is charging my credit card twice, and my subscription is not showing. In an attempt to fix this error, I am canceling one of the subscriptions, but there is no change. I'm sorry, but Evernote, you are a disappointment and not serving any purpose."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't waste your time with this app, find another free note taking app as evernote have practically backed users into a corner to pay for a very basic service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app since it was called 3banana notes. For the past several years now every single time I go to add to an existing note etc I have to dodge all these popups trying to get me to spend money. Now today, they're telling me I need to spend $130 for an annual membership to have over 50 notes. Except between my notes and trash, I only have 23, and it is completely refusing to let me make a new note. I think after 10+ years it's time to move on and find a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It does its job but recently constant ads to upgrade. I've have had this app for years but moving away now. No way I'm paying for a notepad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not download!! Unless you plan to spend $20+ per month on a simple note taking app, don't download. I had the free version for many years, but for the past year, it interrupted me constantly to upgrade. But now, it's virtually unusable. I'm well under my limit and it won't allow me to add any more notes unless I upgrade. I copied all my info and moved everything over to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"GOODBYE EVERNOTE!!! Been a user since 2018, but now they wanna charge 99€ a year for the service?! FOR ANYONE WHO'S LOOKING FOR A NOTE TAKING APP, LOOK ELSEWHERE! Sure you can have 1 notebook with 50 notes for free, but I can compare that to them spitting in the face of all their past users. I spent a full day copying all my notes to Samsung Notes. PS I've never wrote a negative review for an app in my life, hope this shows how disappointed myself and others are in Evernotes greed. DISGRACEFUL!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I guess I spoke to soon. Looks like since my subscription expired, I can no longer make ""new notes"". Fortunately I have enough old, no longer needed notes. That I can reuse them. OLD: I would like to thank this app for NOT punishing those of us that have subscribed in the past but let our subscription expire. With other apps being so punitive, trying to get us to renew. It's nice to see a app that allows us to go back to a free user. Rather then taking away the ""free"" from ex subscribers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good in past years, but it has now become one of the worst apps in the market. Stored files do not open when you need them, they keep loading forever. You can't select multiple notes and delete at the same time, you must do them one by one. Many annoying adds I'm looking for a way move all my notes to another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have a bad login bug. I thought I used login with Google but it wasn't the correct account. The app now prompts to login with email/password but the email field is locked to the Google email. I can't clear the email field to try my other email that the account is apparently under."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too glitchy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used and loved Evernote for years, but the recent policy change that limits free users to 50 notes and one notebook is a complete deal breaker. They've held hundreds of my notes hostage, and now I'm forced to migrate elsewhere. How about making the paid features worth the money instead of ruining the free version? This is a completely senseless decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It WAS very user friendly. I used to love it. That said, constantly getting in-app adds pushing to upgrade is annoying. As of Dec 2023, the app glitches and will blank a note you are attempting to work with, then bring it back up. Repeatedly. Almost every time you access the note. This, after random duplication of notes. It's *almost* like they're punishing you for not upgrading..... Edit: As of 1/4/24, two days after writing this review, I can't access the app. At all. Nice customer service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has been gutted to the point where the free version is no longer really usable. Constantly spams pop-ups asking to upgrade. If you're just looking for a regular note taking app, look elsewhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over a decade and the new payment system is more than outrageous. Your insane greed is leading me to look for other sources to keep my notes and files on. It's so incredibly disappointing, I've recommended friends to this app and now I'm left feeling like I've been screwed over. You were good while you lasted. You suck now. This app is far to glitchy for the over 100 dollars your asking for the year. It's not worth it. I'm sad to see you fall this far."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will now say goodbye to this app. I've been using this since 2019. I really hate that I've been limited to add notes, notebooks, etc. Before, you can add as many as you want, now you can't. I'm very disappointed with what they've done to the app, because it was so much better before. Man, I've really enjoyed this app, but it downgraded so bad. Anyways, I found an app which is a lot better than this. Evernote, goodbye. You've been disappointed me too much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From a very good app that I used for years to an unusable app in a matter of months. What a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Used to be 5 star"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for years. I was a premium user for a while and was thinking about going back to premium. The updates now to this new subscription plan is sadly a deal breaker for me. The price for premium is double what it was and even the note limit for free has made it unusable. Too much for a note app even if it works great. I have moved all my notes to another app and will now no longer use Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updated the apps.. now its getting worse they limited the free plan only 50 notes, If Evernote doesn't have a better solution maybe as soon as this February I and some of my group will start moving to a note application which is more rational in terms of price and maybe gets better in terms of features and performance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i've been using this app since 2012. They've now added a hard limit (of 1 notebook, 50 notes) to using a once-upon-a-time completely free app (within a reasonable data limit, i think it was 2gb of cloud). i will no longer be using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally disapointing that they would create a 50 note limit out of nowhere unless you pay. I'll be looking for a different notes app and discontinuing use with Evernote. I have well over 50 notes and can't create anymore notes due to this recent update they have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible. Unreliable. Right now lost whole hour of written note cause it just flashed and didn't save, in the middle of typing, no backup. Save your notes now (altough when trying to copy a headline elsewhere the pasted text is ""formating error.... ""). Don't purchase and run away!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What used to be a decent app, right down the drain. What an irony, making the app worse and more unusable as it relentlessly pushes you to pay for it. There are now TWO pop ups that demand money before you can do anything, often I lose the thought I was trying to jot down, and that's if I can even make it past the pop ups, the app force closing, and half the time taking me to an empty note bc it won't load. Are you making the app worse so people pay for premium? Idiotic and shamefully greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The Evernote's policy change of Dec.2023 and the super high prices for home users, are making harder to keep using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a greedy, scummy app. As many have pointed out, most features that used to be available for the masses are now behind a pay wall. Recently, they made it to where you can only have 50 free notes. I have 23, and there's a glitch where it won't allow you to make more. Every time you open the app, you get bombarded by them asking you to subscribe. A subscription for a notes app?!? And for $130 A YEAR?!? Stick to samsung notes. It's basically the same and it's free. What a horrible company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very good app in the past, but too many annoying ads now, new limits and expensive plans. Stay away!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App keeps telling me that I can only have 50 notes in the free plan and doesn't let me create a new note even though I only have 29 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a HUGE scam and the developers should be ashamed of themselves for restricting note taking limits. Firstly, the app restricts you to 50 notes. Why? There's no reason for this. There are a plethora of other note taking apps that are free, open-source, and don't force you to sign up for an account. Anyone looking to download Evernote, be wary, it is a scam. I highly suggest looking for alternatives out there. Never support greedy cooporations like Evernote. Don't give them a penny!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and it was everything I wanted. Easy to organize and nice functionality. But the requests to upgrade are so aggressive. And now they have drastically reduced the features you get on the free version. I would pay but the price for one year, OF A NOTES APP, is outrageous. I'm moving on to something else after all this time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 блокнот и 50 заметок? вы серьёзно? в скором времени уйду на бесплатные аналоги upd: goodbye elephant, I've moved on Joplin"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The pay gating on this app is ridiculous considering how many just like it exist for free. The free version is completely unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote really missed the mark. Instead of charging $0.99 or $1.99 per month and getting millions of subscribers, they opted for a much more expensive subscription that is nowhere near a sane value proposition for what it is. So I'm one of the many who've been trapped in the middle. Unwilling to pay the absurd subscription fee, and thus faced with endless pop-ups and requests to upgrade. I've been a user since nearly the beginning, but I migrated everything to OneNote today."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's just constantly trying to sell you plans now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user since like 2016, but now I'm stopping using evernote. New free plan with 50 notes limitation is awful, to say the least. Also worth mentioning are recurring glitches, freezes, ads etc. And oh, I looked at the top reviews here - NO positive reviews AT ALL (!) It's a shame what your product has become over years, evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for over a decade. It was always a simple, free and mostly unlimited note taking software which is what made it good. Now it's an expensive, guady racket. Thanks for ruining it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great years ago after using this app for 10+ years im now deleting it. They keep taking away basic functions forcing you to subscribe, with harassing adverts to access your information. Updated and lost all my notes from years of using this app. Because now i have to pay. Thanks for nothing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APP. It used to be great but over time they have steadily stripped it of features, making the free version more and more unusable. The constant pop-ups telling you to upgrade have been a pain for years, but now they introduce a 50 note limit?? I'd even consider this reasonable if you could buy a premium version for a small one-off payment but they expect you to pay the same monthly price as a netflix subscription. Now I have to painstakingly transfer all my notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable app, you cannot create any additional notes past 50 notes even though you make room by deleting old notes. They ask for 100+ $ a year (not a one-time payment) for an unlimited number of notes, which is an insanely expensive price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use it to write a small note for anymore (which is the hole purpose of this app) because EVERYTIME YOU OPEN IT will give a ""limited time offer"" that you have to click multiple times to get rid of."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Getting worse, recently heavily. Problems with syncing notes, duplicates for no reason, text formating issues, problems to load... Unreliable, uncomfortable to use. For Europeans, daily ""Evernote temporarily unavailable"".Advertising for upgrade, changing conditions for free use and blocking previous possibilities. I used to like the app and would support it but asking so much for unreliable servise which gets worse, no way. Moving to different app after 10years of using. Thank you and good luck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Password lock reset every 2 or 3 days"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable now due to pay wall and popups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an Evernote free user since 2013. They just implemented a ONE notebook/FIFTY notes limit on free users. I can't make more notebooks OR notes since I'm well over that limit. I HAVE to subscribe or else Evernote is useless and just taking up phone storage. Honestly, for having been a user for so long, I (and surely others) should have been just grandfathered in. Enshittification at its finest."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A few years ago it was great, but it's getting worse.. plus, they are pushing more and more for the subscription which is just annoying at this point; I'd rather switch, and I'm going to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"scum"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would be great if it didn't loop forever before opening notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'll put up with everything except crashing. And this app won't even open, despite multiple bug reports. I thought it was a problem with my tab but no, when I come there for reviews, so many people have experienced the same problem. Edit: I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app. And I've lost some of the notes I made. Safe to say i won't be relying on the app again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's sickening how greedy this company has become. Goodbye forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been happy with the free version for many years but recently have had lots of problems with the app crashing immediately upon opening. I have uninstalled and reinstalled twice within the last month. This fixes it for a little while. The unexpected crashing is highly frustrating and will send me to the apps of competitors. 2021 review Problems have increased and are the same as all other problems as mentioned in other reviews. I've had an absolute gutful of the unreliability. Review 2024"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a brilliant app but the new paywall restrictions made it unusable overnight."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this is a goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly pushing premium services and won't let me create new notes. Been using this since 2014. Will now be looking to use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absurdly aggressive marketing. I use it for simple.things. thoughts here and there. EVERY time I open it always prompts for me to pay and upgrade. I don't want to, buzz off! It also bugs out often. Time to switch. It WAS good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a long time free version user. I got bumped back to 50 free notes. I only have 30, and it still will not let me add another. No support unless you're a paying customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many pop ups. I used to have a 5 star review but now it's almost un-usable with the pop ups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version allowed me to write 340 notes before they limited to 50 per account. Constant pop ups to try and sell me premium. I'm switching to google drive. This is a betrayal from over a decade I have been using this product. Hoerible decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2011, in the past few years it's becoming increasingly slow, bloated, pushy about upgrading to paid (pop ups prompting it every single time you open the app), and moving features behind paywalls. Recent update limited free users to a max of 50 notes, making it useless for long time users who already had hundreds. I've spent the past couple of days moving all my old notes to Google Keep and will be glad to never use Evernote again. Shame though, it used to be great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have to pay $160 a year to use it now. No more free option. App had been going downhill in quality for years and this is the final blow. Uninstalling and switching to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good but now ruined by incessant ads to subscribe. I've moved to Google Notes; it's missing some functionality but it just works without pestering you all the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime I open the app I get 3 ads in a row that I have to close and then click ""I am sure""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just changed it were the free plan limits you to only 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A little too much harassment for buying a monthly plan ._."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"piece of trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many annoying ads to buy the paid version of the app. Hard to use becouse of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"About to look into alternatives thanks to how limited it's become unless you pay their insane subscription fee. FYI, paywalling features that used to be free isn't going to make your users want to pay for them, but it does make them want to use other apps. How many times do we have to teach app designers this lesson?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They've put a limit on notes and notebooks on free users which is absolutely ridiculous. Only 50 notes? What's wrong with you guys? That's a laughable small amount. I've moved all of my notes to Obsidian which has been much easier to work with. See ya later, Evernote team! May your app and business burn to the ground!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app isn't worth your time anymore. It's outdated and their pricing scheme is absolutely out to lunch. They've recently implemented a maximum 50 note policy unless you subscribe for Premium which costs an outrageous $130 USD. I've Uninstaller the app, and made the switch to a diffent one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Amazing app. The only downside is paying for the app. It seems like these people are just money hungry. 14 dollars a month to take notes is insane. I wish I could just do a onetime payment for a lifetime access of all the features of the app. That would be much much better. There is no way to talk to the people of Evernote they don't have an email address. Maybe they just don't care about dissatisfaction maybe it's all about the money with them. All I want is onetime payment for lifetime access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Useful application but it constantly nags to upgrade to paid version. It got to the point where it is unusable. I am moving to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this but now every time I open it the app asks me to pay and I have to go through an entire thing just to view my documents. Ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Longtime user gone. I've been using Evernote for *years* but I have to move on. I've been priced out and now I can no longer access my existing notes and notebooks because the plans now are limited to fewer notes and notebooks than I already had existing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basically un-usable now unless you pay for it. It used to be good but with the latest update they restricted you to 50 notes & 1 notebook. If you already had more than 50 notes/1 notebook (as most of us do, especially if you've used it for any length of time), congratulations! You can no longer edit or organise ANY of them. It asks you if you want to pay (NO! STOPPIT!), not just every time you open the app, but also every time you click ANYTHING AT ALL. Worse than useless, infuriating as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using the app for years in free mode. Didn't need much notes. I recently tried to use the app, but I'll be charged over 130 dollars to make a few notes. I'm switching to another note organizer. The fee is ridiculously high. Not worth using the app for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I agree with other members that this use to be a great program. I upgraded to personal the options became unnecessary. Then Evernote is increasing the cost which doesn't substantiate the worthiness of the program. Been trying to downgrade however extremely difficult instead the process offers a discount which I am not interested."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am a long time customer who doesn't use enough features to be willing to pay after last year's price increase. Kudos for their export strategy. I saved a backup. I may never stop using the free version as long as they allow me to read my old notes. -2 stars for leaving customers like me behind with their new high price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recommended this app to so many people. Now can't even make a new note. Used it for years. Please change it back or I will switch platforms."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a good note app but when I think of something and want to quickly make a note, I don't want to keep being offered premium and then confirm I'm sure I don't want it. The frequency of the premium offer is tempting me to go back to using the stock app. Edit: I'm now being hit with a premium offer twice when I log in. Once was bad enough. Once I've transferred my notes will be deleting the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Как же надоела реклама вашей подписки. Чтобы открыть заметку нужно закрыть стопицот попапов, которые всегда появляются в самый неподходящий момент. Да и еще цена предлагаемой подписки как за лицензию навороченного IDE, а по факту тормазнутый убогий дизайн 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A shell of its former glory"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not saving notes, that I've already typed. Very Fustrating. Been a user for about 10 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every single note I open is preceded by a notice to pay for subscription, and then a discount on the subscription, even though I'm using less than 50 notes. It's a frustrating experience to click twice before seeing every note. Will need to find a different app since Evernote doesn't care about its users and only cares about money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying popups for paid account upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but now it keeps glitching duplicating notes on its own and now saying I have reached my notes limit!! And ads would not stop popping up!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get to my notes, want's me to pay to up grade. This is the worst app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app deserves a much lower rating. Charges so much for a simple use of notes? Come on guys, there are free options many places. The functions in this app are clunky and slow, very annoying to use. Not to mention, if you stop paying they pester you every single time you use it. Glad i finally left this app behind!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely reduced functionality as well as the same question several times a day about upgrading. Why not just be honest and close the free service and only continue with the paid subscription. Found a better alternative to simple notes. ----------------- 2021.04.18: ** Recent update means that synchronization between PC and mobile often fails and notes can therefore not be accessed on other devices until I have been back and enforce Sync several times. Time to find alternatives to Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote free edition is terrible downgraded. Subscription plan way too expensive. Constant pop-up harassments to give them money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very stingy. Every function is for a cost now. Basically you can't use the app at all for free anymore. I.m unistalling it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"using for 10+ years. absolutely terrible now. stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good before, now you have to pay if you want to have more than 50 notes... Ridiculous..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not allowing to add notes... used to be my favourite apl from years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used ever note for years and have well over a dozen notebooks, and hundreds on notes only to open the app and be greeted with demands to pay 130 dollars a year if I ever want to write another note or organize them into notebook. No thank you, ill be transferring my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst than before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What on earth would make this worth $160 per year?! I think they're trying to get rid of users on purpose"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Dagm"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Give Evernote a miss. What was once a great tool is now a steaming pile of incompetent greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Пользовался с декабря 2008 года (15 лет), последние годы ничего не добавлял (приложение испортилось и для заметок использовал другие), но иногда смотрел старые заметки (почти 10 тысяч) как архив. Из-за последнего обновления бесплатно нельзя даже изменить старые заметки, лимит теперь один блокнот и 50 заметок! Спасибо, что под новый год подтолкнули экспортировать всё и окончательно перенести в Obsidian."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally disappointed with the new pricing terms.. How can the developer being so greedy and asking all free users to pay to continue using the app? The limitation for ""free"" user is getting ridiculous.. It's never been free when you can do nothing with ""free"" version.. Rubbish!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit now, screw that"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They took all of the useful note taking space and now you have to pay to use it in any meaningful way. I was a user from 2015 and I'm leaving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every other time I open a note there's a pop-up with button to get out. And every time I hit back and go back into the note it comes back. I remember when evernote was good. You guys are trash now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too much pushing to buy the paid version. The app has always been slow to open, but it's okay. However, since months ago, the advertisement to get the paid version has been too much, every single time I open the app it appears, I always say no, I am sure no, but it keeps asking and asking, it's so annoying that I already found a different notes app. Bye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good job ignoring the cost of user acquisition. I loved this app and used it for years. The new and unreasonably expensive subscription model is a loser. You're losing me and so many other loyal users. Good luck with your plan. If it fails for you, how are you going to get us all back? It'll be too late because we're all moving on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was very disappointing today to find out today that after years of use and many notes saved that I can't create anything on the app unless I pay $130/year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time you use the App it wants you to upgrade, absolutely annoying! So much screw Evernote. Switching to OneNote as it doesn't ask me to upgrade every time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using it for some ten years it's time to look for alternatives. Using the free version can do only minimal stuff now. I cannot even create a new note while I haven't reach my limit (I suppose). Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I love the functionality, but I'm deleting the app because I have to click 4 times to reject purchasing an upgrade almost every time I open the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To anyone still looking for an alternative, I highly recommend UPNOTE, simple to use and solves every problem I have with Evernote. I officially wash my hands of Evernote. It was fun... until it wasn't."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was great until today. I use a free account. When I try to create a new note it asks if want to upgrade as my limit of 50 notes has been reached. There's a button that says ""continue with free account,"" but when I click on it, it sends me back to the upgrade screen in an endless loop. I tried restarting the phone, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, and deleting notes until I had under 50. Still stuck in the endless loop. Fix and restore my free account or I'm never touching it again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest change has made This app useless. There are plenty of free / open source alternatives if you google it. I'm sure some people will pay to continue with it. I'm not one of them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying frequent notifications trying to make you buy the payed version and limited number of notes in the free version. Seems to me like it's getting worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible can not cancel!! Do not recommended this service to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for springing the note limitation without any warning whatsoever. The app was great...about 10 years ago. It's gotten progressively worse over the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How the mighty have fallen. Evernote used to be THE note taking app, the OG. But these days through a combination of steadily worsening functionality and an overly greedy subscription model, there are plenty of better alternative apps for taking notes and syncing them across multiple devices. I finally migrated all my Evernote notes to a different app and haven't looked back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Would be 5 stars but the're charging too much just to write"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable due to the constant pop-ups to ""upgrade"". Uninstalling today after 5 years use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years using without any issue, I woke up to 2024 learning that I'm now restricted to 50 notes if I continue using the free version. While the last year was insufferable with the constant pop ups of upgrade and the lies that the ""offer"" wouldn't be given again, I stayed for the convenience, now I'm moving it all to onenote and I'm very happy with my decision. Rest in peace, evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limitation for basic plan bring me to found better note organizer. Happy losing user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Out of a sudden after an update it says that I can't add any notes until it's paid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have 100s of notes saved and now I have to pay. I'll find another"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is good as a note taking app, but it's only tolerable if you pay for it. I've been using a free account for a couple years with no issue, and I've enjoyed my experience up until a few months ago. Now all of a sudden the free version limits you to 50 notes. I also can't open the app without having to close a pop up asking me to upgrade to a paid subscription before I can start using the app. This has become so annoying that I'm uninstalling it for a different, and less pushy notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it for years, even subscribed at one point. Now trying to copy the last of the notes out but they're being held hostage. I ABSOLUTELY would advise against putting any important info into this app. A shame to see this app crash and burn so spectacularly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doubled in price. Again. They think they can extort us because we trusted them with our data and it's hard to migrate. Heck no, I'm moving on. If you're new to Evernote, don't get sucked in."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait & switch! All of a sudden, I can't make ANY MORE notes without paying a huge yearly membership. I've used Evernote for keeping track of so many things for years. What a huge disappointment! I have no problem paying for a membership to something I use regularly, but give me a reasonable lifetime fee. I'm not paying that much every year. (If you need a good example, check out the Tasks app. Steve is awesome and provides way more value for small fee.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was once a great app is now functionally useless. Unless you fork over $150+ for a yearly subscription older users can essentially no longer use the app at all, and new users will be severely limited. Don't waste your time here, almost any other app is a better option now. Once I move my notes across to another app I will be uninstalling this one and never coming back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywalled notes after the fact. 50 limit even though had the app years. Waste of time now. Use a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this app for years and now all of a sudden it requires a $157 per year subscription to create more than 50 notes!? That's extortionate! Even more frustrating, I deleted a bunch of notes so I have less than 50 and emptied the trash and it still says I've reached the limit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love this app its change my life style"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the app switched to 50 notes max it become unusable not only because of inability to add notes but mostly because it spams you with advertisement to upgrade every time you open it. And that advertisement is purposely badly designed - the Cancel button is placed in an unnatural place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my go-to for creating notes. Now that Evernote has essentially paywalled how many notes you can make now, I'm going to find another note taking app that doesn't have predatory paywall practices. It's nice to know that Evernote doesn't care about their users!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"That's it. I'm migrating out of Evernote. The only thing that works there is their payment collection department."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote user since 2010, I need to transfer my files to other apps or pc, thank's for everything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's garbage now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling this greedy app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be so great, fast become utter garbage due to developer greed! $130/ yr for a relatively standard note taking app is insane! Especially the per year part, good luck with that one guys."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worthless. Business model doesn't include using on more than one device at a time. Can't access old notes using new phone without overwriting acess on other device. Unhinged decision-making."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have adored this app since 2013. Now I hate it. I have dozens of notes and a handful of notebooks...and now I'm suddenly being told that I'm not allowed to create any more notes because of a new pay wall. This is absolutely disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is not usable now and paid version cost has doubled from last year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years and have 100's of notes and notebooks on here. Now I have to pay for a FREE app...NO THANK YOU now and always. I'll be finding a new app and telling everyone to stay away"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but now flat out doesn't work. ""Your account is limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes"". I only have 1 notebook with 25 notes and it won't let me add any new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Безумное количество рекламы платной версии"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app crashes constantly, and on the rare occasions it's actually working, most of my time is spent looking at a spinning circle. I have the paid version of Evernote and generally use it on my Windows 11 desktop where it works well. I've just wasted several hours trying to use it on an HP Chromebook with the Google app, and will never bother doing that again. Reload, crash. Reload, crash. Reload, crash. This app is terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely despicable. I've used evernote for years, but recently the ads have gotten out of control. And now there's a note limit?? You've got to be kidding me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slow and buggy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So slow!!! I have premium and its really starting to get on my nerves. Typing (desktop or mobile) is becoming a slog, and I only have a few hundred notes. Going to explore alternatives soon if it doesn't improve. Surely there's a way to simplify the apps for performance, even at the expense of features?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new subcripcion base plan are insane now i have to migrate all my note to another plataform. Because the free version is so anoyying with at least 3 time asking for a upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS. they balckmail you to pay them or else you cannot access your stuff or export them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I use the app I have to close the advertisement for the paid version. I'm sick of it. I'm going to use something else that isn't as obtrusive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Relentlessly pushing for an upgrade to paid version. This has made the previously great free version a total pain to use as there are maybe three pop ups to close every time the app is opened. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is digging its own grave. I really don't appreciate the fact that it's suddenly forcing you to upgrade with no warning. The paid plans are pricey, too. Will switch to a competitor ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you guys so obsessed with ""add a payment method first and subscribe before even letting the user try the app !!!"" Let the user try the app first... Later ask if they want your subscriptions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: This app is stupid and I suggest everyone deletes it. Waste of time and gets worse with ads. STOP TELLING ME TO UPGRADE. Why does this happen every time? It is frustrating. It slows me down when trying to make quick notes at work. It is also just slower in general. It keeps duplicating my notes. It loses information that I typed out which is the worst part. I'll definitely be looking for a better note taking app. I can't have my information disappearing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywall? Really? You're an app for writing notes. You can't possibly have that much overhead. Just put some ads or something."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"its a trap. been using for several years. low level usage. all of a sudden I'm 'consuming' too much resource and no longer allowed to access existing notes. I have a free account and a premium account. I'm not allowed to access either. fortunately there are other good options out there. will be a hassle to transition, but that's exactly what I'm going to do."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Downgrading to 3 stars. Way too expensive for what it is, and price continues to go up. And pop-ups to sign up for the monthly membership are relentless -- often multiple times in one session. I originally paid for this app when I installed it, but I am currently in the process of migrating to another app that has everything I need and is free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't enjoy the app. Restricted access for unpaid plans renders app useless. I was a fan, but now I get annoying pop ups. Deleting and never using evernote again. Finding other apps that will support me better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I never leave ratings unless it is really good or really bad. I've been using this app for years. Lots of important stuff on here. Now I find out they have put everything useful behind a paywall. I would pay a one time fee, but no way I'm paying a ridiculous monthly fee at $15 a month! Hopefully other ppl will find a better app to support than this. There are much better options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be 5 stars. The push for monetization has led to increased ads to ""purchase premium"" and removing basic features that used to be free. Save your time and use one of the many free better alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once great now greedy, I get that devs need money to keep their products going but 130/yr for something that I only use to take notes here and there? Now I can't make multiple notebooks or new notes suddenly? So long! I'm glad it's easy to import into OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rated the app 5 stars back in 2013. App went from being good to being useless. Chipping away at features and the constant pop ups to upgrade makes it next to unusable. I will be finding an alternative and uninstalling"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow in general, many of the img files will get lost and never load again. Now, this app believes it can ask for such high price rates. There are better and cheaper apps in the market. This APP is not worth paying for. Not even the free version is worth its use anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have Evernote (free version) for more than couple of years and have saved some really important notes and information for myself. Recently, I am being harrassed by this app to buy the paid version whenever I log in. It's like, they keep the information on ransom with their hard to close pop ups to buy the paid version. Quite shameful to beg like this to get a paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be fantastic. Then they changed the interface for no good reason making it a much worse experience. And that experience is now insufferable as every time you open the app you're subjected to constant pop-ups begging you to subscribe to it's overpriced annual offers. Stay far away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had this app for years . And I absolutely love it . But now they won't let me do anything because a pop-up keeps coming up . Making you pay instead of the free version It's really frustrating because I have a lot of stuff saved on it . I did years ago give this app a 5 star review, but now I'm so upset . This app meant the world to me, and I can't believe they are doing this . Use are going to lose a lot of people that have been using this app. So, if you never used this app, WALK AWAY!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For some years, I've grown frustrated with businesses constantly nickel & diming. Though this app is great, I can't imagine having to pay $15.00 a month for any app that doesn't over-deliver. I would love to purchase the app at $4.99, however, I understand overhead costs, debt & seeking to earn net revenue to keep it running. The app doesn't take as much to upkeep, so I know costs to run doesn't warrant the price monthly or otherwise. So I would tell people to move on if possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New Updates sucks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow and shortcuts main screen don't work any more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since 2011, used to be my go to app for notes, but I've moved on to MS Onenote. It doesn't integrate with anything, has been limiting features more and more. Latest round of limitations has pushed me away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since I paid the extortionate subscription increase, this app has become 100% unusable. Won't sync. Just closes. Very disappointing. Total waste of money....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Im using evernote since 2016 , now if i want to save notes i have to pay my salary for one month in Egypt 1500 LE , are you mad ! , ill delete my account , and thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 5 years using this app, it is time to say goodbye. This app force me to buy annual subscription and input new record has been reach the limit. Thank you. I will migrate to MS One Note part of Office 365"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using this app since 2017 and LOVED it up until recently. Now the app doesn't function correctly (randomly freezes then shuts down and hitting any back buttons also closes the app). Also, It now constantly asks for an outrageous subscription cost. I understand not being able to offer it for free forever, but it's absolutely not worth the paywall price they're asking!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Honestly, This is a pretty sad situation. The simplest things are now turned complicated, because others are doing it. As others here, have pointed out. its now all through a paywall. This is what happens when companies get to big for themselves. They get popular and massive amounts of subscribers or downloads, then all of a sudden. Boom! We can profit from this. This strategy just forces us to go to the next big thing and abort apps that do this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Excellent. Wish we have better tools to draw arrows"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Make it a little more simple please. The new features are great edit 2023 - avoid this app if you don't want to be bothered by pay walls every 5 seconds. not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its been quite a few days that the android app is not letting me log in. Its shows a message ""can't login at the moment""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just the worst app of all time. Just trying to read my own lyrics and it's giving me an endless pop-up loop to upgrade even though I'm only using 2 devices. Cannot perform my music because the app is a nightmare. Ditching forever ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a personal user, there is no way it is worth $15/mo for a fancy cloud text editor. I exported my notes to another app, and uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rip evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. Does not accept any sharing from any app Does not keep copy of texts written. Does not work photos from camera. If not fixed I will have to opt out of the beta version. Still a problem since I cannot grab any html from my Android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free became limited"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used this app for years. I really like it's lay out and usability. Recently it told me that I had exceeded my note limit. I deleted a lot of old notes, leaving only 13. It still said could not create any notes because I exceeded the limit. I would have to pay over $120 per year to keep using the app. I will be using pen and paper now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for several years now. I have not needed theadditional features that come with the cost of an upgrade so I have stuck with the free version...until today. I tried to make a new note, but kept getting a pop up to upgrade because I was at this new maximum of notes. I will now be transitioning to another method of taking the notes I need and as I have time I will be moving ALL of my current notes OUT of Evernote and will be deleting my account. Can't recommend any longer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's over. I'm not paying for constant begging for money and slow UI. There are many other apps that do the same stuff and are free. Thank you for many years of a great app even if sluggish but paying for all of that is out of question."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 free note and then you have to pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I applaud you for fixing the previous glitch that was tedious which was my notes copying. However I'm editing my review to say limiting it to 50 notes is such a poor decision. Those who have been using it for years will definitely have way more than that. It was so much better when it was a monthly limit. That was fine. 50 notes and one notebook however is ludicrous. I'm not the only one to say this either. You made your free version basically useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't write reviews but need to for this one. I've used this app for a while but the pop ups to ask you to pay are making it unusable. Thank you for the many years of use, but I'll be moving on. No longer a good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This subscription model sucks. One time payment would be perfect. But not only that, it says the limit is 50 but I have 33 notes and no other notebooks and it won't let me keep have new ones. I even deleted one to have 32 and won't let me go back to 33.... I'll start the year with a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a ridiculously garbage software it has gotten NOTHING but WORSE ever since I started using it. Ridiculously I can't copy text once highlighted to paste. What makes u THINK I'm EVER gonna pay you EVERcrappierNOTE?? Fire all ur incompetent coders and find better ones. Can't believe I can't copy and paste, A BASIC FUNCTION computers have had FOREVER! How you gonna SCREW up copying and pasting as a NOTE APP? Don't waste ur time with this garbage app and CERTAINLY DON'T PAY FOR IT!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now the free version barely works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the app for a decade. Slowly it's been getting worse and worse and don't even get me started on the persistent popups trying to get me to buy a premium account...but to now stop me from creating a basic note, what a joke! Actively looking for alternatives now. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"STOP STUFFING THIS REVIEW DOWN MY THROAT. now you force the app over here for a review, well enjoy your poor review. maybe stop harassing paying customers before you have none left"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used for year's. Now it costs money and I can't make any new note's. Since I had a lot of important notes along with recipes it was a real pain having to copy & paste everything over to a different, free note app so thanks for that headache. You could have went with ads or charge cheap money to upgrade to a pro version. There's no way I'm paying your outlandish price to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they just removed many free notes program options. app just constantly pushes the cost membership, which is comedically expensive, just to be able to make a fresh note now. Garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for over 10 years since it can pull recipes from websites. Love that! But now I can't add notes unless I pay for a subscription? And not $5/month but $15! This is the last straw. I'll switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After being a loyal Evernote user for the better part of a decade and maybe longer, looks like this is it. Opening the app and suddenly telling me I can't make notes without paying is garbage. I will switch to one of Evernote's many free competitors. Farewell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was a great app, EXCEPT now with the ridiculous amount of pop-up advertisements to upgrade that make very it frustrating. Stop the pop-ups or make it subscribe only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I 've been using it for couple of year. Each update was better than previous one. But this latest update is worst one and made this app super complex. Previous way of formatting was much easier but this categorization of formatting in this update has made it so irritating. Furthermore, no discard alert appears now on going back after doing some changes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very big fan but since they started pushing their paid for platform the constant prompts to upgrade every time you open the app are very irritating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is a good app but sometimes it won't save your notes, which defeats the purpose of the app if you want to remember something important. At this point every time I open the app it asks me to upgrade, and when I close the pop up and asks me if I'm sure. It's horrible, and there's nothing I can do because I've put so many important notes in it. Don't use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They have now made it useless without paying, you can only have up to 50 notes. I would have rather they put up ads, they only put their own ads to upgrade and they do so very very often."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a satisfied long-term paying customer, using it on 6 devices. When version 10 came along and was forced to upgrade, Evernote became a complete disappointment. Only a few of my hundreds of notebooks were available off-line. Synching was hit-or-miss. Some notes were unavailable even when on-line. My myriad emails to their customer support were answered by canned responses. As such, and along with their steep price increase, I have cancelled my subscription and have subscribed to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Amazing how everybody can bail on a once popular product, and the company running it doesn't clue in to the fact that they've ruined a good thing. I predict they'll go under in less than 5 years. Most of us just want basic note taking ability, with formatting, search function, and accessibility. Few people need it want to pay for collaboration, multimedia, complex organization schemes, etc. Can't even create a new note under the new pricing scheme. Can barely access what I already have. Lame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited to 50 notes only. Had this app for 10 years, and in recent months, the bugs started to appear. Now it annoyingly asks for upgrades every few seconds. Moved on to another app, which works seamlessly with Google (and no limits to notes)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thoroughly unstable ... ...almost time for OneNote. Meanwhile over at Swiss Army Knife R&D: ""I know, let's triple the size of our knives and remove all but one of the blades - genius!""..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become so bad - I can't leave shared notebooks (I can only delete them), and so I can't create new notes in my own notebook because the app keeps telling me I need to upgrade in order to have more than one notebook. After wasting so much time trying to fix it, I've just transferred the notes I want to keep to a different app, and deleted Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am yet another user that will be ditching Evernote after using it for 10 years. I would have no problem paying either a reasonable one time access price or even a reasonable monthly subscription price, but current subscription prices are stupid high. Not to mention their incessant nagging about upgrading for the last several months on end. I have no issue with the app and it's capabilities. Just the developer's decision to be greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using the free app. Every time I open the app, I am asked to upgrade. EVERY SINGLE TIME. How about you accept NO? I'm not paying +$130/year for a damn app. I miss the old days of paying once and owning the app indefinitely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Mais anúncios e menor limite de notas. Se você não vai assinar e quer algo a longo prazo, é melhor procurar outro app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Impossible to be productive. Once I switch to another app and come back to Evernote, I need to spend enormous amount of time just to find the place where I left. Evernote does not remember the note and the pace in the note. It starts from the scratch - home page, notebook, note, e.t.c. And do not expect it to be quick. It takes a time. Actually, a lot of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be decent, now constant pushy ads. In short, ive moved to Keep Notes, free, no adverts, shares between devices I only use evernote for literally Notes. I don't need pictures or whatever other pointless bells and whistles may be available. It's to replace a pen and paper. I don't want to pay a rip off subscription for this. A one off payment I'd consider but I expect a lot more for a subscription, like something new every month, and i don't need anything new, so why a subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used evernote for years and in the last few years it has continually declined. The 50 note limit on the free version is the final straw, evernote is unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm disappointed like all other users at the perpetual decline this app has been through for the past couple of years, culminating in December 2023's catastrophe. It's sad to say goodbye, but I am not one who rewards bad behaviour."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Would be a fine app if it didn't shove ads for it's premium subscription every 5 ****ing seconds. Performance is below average"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another long time user (since 2011) that is now having to switch apps due to this insane new pricing model. Beyond disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother. Now limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook. Has never been worth paying for because of terrible search and horrible Android clipping. Now they've sealed their fate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Says the limit is 50 notes so I deleted a bunch of notes and now I only have 23, but I'm still unable to add any new notes unless I pay the subscription fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the app on my android since 2019. The recent updates have affected the functioning of app. It was better in its previous version than the current."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got really disappointed with the app when more of its features are now only available to paid users and so much less for free. Will definitely look for other better apps with similar functions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They ask you to pay them for the premium TOO many times. Can't use the app without getting multiple notifications."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🛰"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"hah... tomorrow for free user just have 10 notes limit then 1 note limit..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant pop ups for ads. Crashing on my phone when going back on app. Only 50 notes for free version. Used to be a good simple app but now it's garbage. There are better options out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A good notes app for quick points to place into basic folders. I switched over to Standard Notes Pro. Standard Notes has everything, multidirectional linking, E2E encryption, fully customizable for zettelkasten nonfolder structure (Logseq/Roam) and/or structured nested folders. File format MD, TXT, SuperMD, Spreadsheets, etc., super fast search through DB and folders. Standard Notes a must have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very very slow and really annoying that they keep on trying to push you to buy the pro level, with this very irritating pop-up that then ask you to confirm that you don't want to all the time. I don't expect to have to do that every few days. The app is lame and will be changing to the different note taking app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am raging angry right now. I have been using this app for 10 years, now they are charging, and I can't even access it on my computer to get thousands of notes off. This is so frustrating. I'm not paying you a dime to get my own information. Do better. I'm pissed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The more you use it, the more it will insist on you paying for it. I'm not gonna pay for a note app thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. At least its really easy to export everything to obsidian so it has that going for it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant pop-up spam to upgrade is wild but the really insane thing is the free plan only allows 50 notes yet I only have 20 & can't create any new ones.... Seriously?!?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Max 50 notes for the free level, and $160 per year for the lowest subscription tier. Ridiculous amount to pay for a notes app when there's so many other good free options out there. I've been using Evernote since 2015 but since I have 77 notes I'm essentially locked out of making new ones unless I delete most of them or pay"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As many others have noted, functionality of free version is increasingly hobbled while subscription rates become more exorbitant. The number of times I am asked to subscribe is very annoying. I have managed to get my free version down to 33 notes (I.e. below the 50 limit) but still can't create any new ones as it says I am over 50. I am now giving up on Evernote completely and have moved to an alternate notes app. Too bad there isn't an easy way to export from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote, however now, I can no longer use the app, as I have 1005 notes and now it is limited to 50 as a free user, you can't edit or do anything. I'm not paying for something that used to be readily available. Evernote - change it back, or you will lose every one of your users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using Evernote for years. Why they thought making a bunch of features require pay wall baffles me. There are free options that come for free with the phone. They just trying to squeeze every bit of money out of an unneeded app. Used for too long due to history with it. But yeah try the other 3 dozen apps if you're built in ones don't meet your needs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years. I use it to keep lists, make quick notes, store recipes, and more. I used to get reminders that more features are available for a paid app, but i was happy with what I used it for. Recently features have started being removed and now I can't add more notes because the free version restricts you to 1 notebook (eliminating the ability to organize) and 50 notes. I'm currently deciding on a new notes app. Anyone have a suggestion?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do like Evernote, but sadly the new tiny folder (1) and note (50l limits mean it isn't an option for me anymore and I shall uninstall once I've found another app to transfer everything over to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Junky"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updating is a mistake. This app has gotten worse. Removing offline content was a stupid choice and now everything lags or doesn't save within the app. It constantly pushes me to buy premium. I've been using this app for 10 years, but looks like I'm finding something else. I get that your boss wants you to force ways to make money for your shareholders, but collectively you SEs are making software awful for everyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Exceptional app. Essential for my productivity. From simple note-taking and storage, to more valuable pdf-searching and organizing, AI cleanup, syncing w/ GoodReads, and the best web-clipper in the business, I simply cannot run my life or business without it. Ignore the 1-star freeloaders, pissed off that EN no longer gives unfettered, free access to the app. They've known about the ""surprise"" price increase for some time. The free version, like most apps, is just to see if it works for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't try without signing in. Instant deal breaker."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a loyal subscriber for more than 10 years. I put up with all the requests to upgrade because I liked the app. Just noticed the free version no longer let's you create new notes and limits you to only 50 notes. Then I realized all my camera images in my notes are all gone. Years and years of notes all gone. I think this is criminal what they did holding my information for ransom unless I upgrade. Anyone else in this situation?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Difficult to navigate and far too expensive for what it does"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too slow, lately. Maybe they added too much functionalities. Aug 2023 update: even worse now.... Half of the time the ""new note"" button ""starts"" but It does nothing... Dec 2023 updated: getting even worse. Zero star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So if you have the free plan you get 50 notes.... But what they don't tell you is if you delete a note you don't get it back. It's 50 notes total forever. So I went through all my notes and condensed some of them and deleted the ones that I no longer needed. Then I went to create a new note for something which made it give me the ""your note limit has been reached"" message. I was confused as I only had 9 active notes, then I realized what the problem was. You guys suck, switching to a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"notes limit, nope thanks, and no I don't need another subscription to take notes. I've been using this app for almost 10 years now, switching to an alternative now.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very choppy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From beginning it was good application BUT, now it is all about money. Frist you can't install on more than two devices if you do not pay extra. Second you can't have more than 50 notes and one notebook if you do not pay. Its mean UNINSTALL imidiately, for new customers do not install. Find cheaper and better!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2014! Been using this app since 2014 and now after over 472 notes you want $130 a year??? Shameful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update now limits free and long-time users to 50 notes (not to mention they've bumped the annual price of their premium service like twice this year, and it's now a whopping $130/yr 💀).... I've been happily using Evernote since 2013, and it's incredibly disappointing to see this app fall as low as it has in recent years. I kept saying for a while that I might have to start looking for alternatives, but now that I can't even make any more notes, I really do have to. Hate to see it happen 🤷‍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a long time paid user. The new 10.x update is awful, removing many features that I found useful, most importantly shortcuts. Fortunately, it is possible to downgrade to the old garish 8.x. 8.x would get 3.5 stars, 10.x until fixed gets 1. Addendum - after the ownership change,agregious price increase and elimination of any useful free version? This app should be avoided by everyone with a very slight exception to those able to expense it ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote recently downgraded free accts to max fifty notes and a single notebook. Meanwhile i have multiple notebooks and all of my recipes are here so I'm well over maxed out and i can't create more. No option to export notes, and app is constantly nagging to upgrade (💰). If I had known they would bait and switch my free account limitations two years ago i never would have used Evernote. I get that services and apps cost money but i feel burned. It's just trial-ware now. Time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointing. Limiting the notes and notebooks. I'm leaving the platform. Good luck keeping customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive used this app since 2013 and now i cant make new notebooks and notes anymore. Just had to get greedy. No thank you. 120 plus aud? You have to be kidding."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote managed to kill a perfect note app in 2020. RIP Edit: from 1 star to 3 Still buggy and slow, but better im December 2021 It's now June 2022. I have reintegrated EN in my workflows and it's getting better. One major issue is still remaining for me, the clipping feature is still failing 50% of the time which impairs my daily use. It is now December 2023. Evernote came back in my life cycle, it is working almost as expected. Except the app crashes everytime on 1st use. @cri Stay tuned."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2017'den beri kullanıyordum ama artık gereksiz derecede pahalı. Özellik satın almadığım için daha fazla not girişi yapmama müsaade etmiyor. Yavaş çalışıyor, bir nottan çıkmaya çalışırken bazen not defterinden hatta uygulamadan bile çıkıyor. Kullanışsız. 6 yıl sonra yollarımızı ayırıyoruz seninle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for many, many years as a simple notes app. Recently I ""reached my limit"" of 50 notes (I had 200+ prior to this!) And even after deleting notes all the way down to 20 left it refused to let me make another one unless I paid the 130$/year subscription. EXCUSE ME? You're a notes app. Act like it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"annoying upgrades pushing everyday"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years and I given it a five stars review. As time went on Evernote has tried in various ways to force users in an unethical way, to my humble opinion, to pay for it's application in a neverending basis. It is overpriced! It is not a value for money product anymore. Good bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years (see below), been putting up with more and more ads, but this is the last straw, being limited to the number of notes allowed. I'm moving my notes to Word, which is still totally ad free and free for Samsung Galaxy. Very very disappointed. Samsung should terminate their agreement with Evernote Amazingly easy to use, and I haven't even used any handwriting or drawings. Great for taking notes during lectures with the continuous keyboard"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a great app steadily being ruined by monetization. I understand companies have to make money but the high price tag as well as stripping away and limiting features that used to be available for free users is not it. The most recent decision to limit the number of notes to 50 and notebooks to ONE for free users has to be one of their worst decisions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 5 years of using this app, they limited my account to 50 notes and a single notebook, effectively making the app unusable to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible its now not showing images its done deliberately to force us to upgrad e"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time user of the app I liked that it was cross platform compatible I didn't mind the ads, or notifications pushes. Now that they are limiting how many notes I can create and I've apparently reached the limit I'll have to wish the app good-bye it was nice while it lasted I'll be moving all my files and deleting my account thanks evernote team."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for a long time now, on previous mobile phones as well. Now that there's a 50 note limit placed (I'm well past that number in notes) I can't make any new notes without paying for a subscription. It's also annoying that their ads pop up every single time I launch. I get that it's all about the money-grab & not so much anything else for most of these apps nowadays. I'll be switching my notes over elsewhere and using alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This software has not changed in years and they do not notify you of any price increases. They're playing the lottery with bank accounts and their help page sends you in circles with no option to request a refund. They have you go through iTunes or Google play. I've had Evernote since before either of those were used to sell apps. I ended up emailing their compliance department. No way their service is worth the prices they are now charging. 200% in two years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, but starting in May 2023 the developers started breaking features resulting in data loss and broken sketch/handwriting support on Samsung devices. Support tickets open since September 2023 have not been replied to and user forums are toxic. Only thing that has changed is the cost has gone up 3x."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Piece of mind - Evernote keeps everything important safe and in one spot"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The features locked behind over priced pay walls are ridiculous. Let me see my damn tasks or tell me how to export my 500+ notes to a different app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but it's been super pushy asking for me to upgrade. I switched to Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"having to pay for more than one notebook and 50 notes is a drawback however the AI formatting is definitely more conducive to organization than my thought vomit of Google notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EVERNOTE HAS GONE FULL GREEDY!!! GO BANKRUPT FOR ALL YOUR DUMB DECISIONS! All i need is something to store notes and now Evernote has become 100% greedy and even makes simple light use a daunting task unless i WASTE $5.83 a month for options i dont want or need. Used to be a great app. Now its pricey trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became really bad and everytime you open it pop up come plus some people hacked it before and stole the password and had access to it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant begging to upgrade to premium every time I open a note now. The arbitrary 50 note limit is truly insane. Made me consider why I wasn't just using Google Docs or whatever notes app comes pre-loaded on my phone for basically the same functionality. It feels like users are being squeezed so that developers can continue to develop more features that most people don't really need but which sound great to investors who think that a note-taking app has huge profit growth potential."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow....just wow...deserve a ZERO Holding our notes as hostage out of the blue. Free used to be great for my personal info with the limitations but this is different. I will be looking for an alternative, transferring out and un-installing. Just slimey ....very slimey move. Not going to vouch for companies that do this kind of move. Multiple paid corporate accounts will not be renewed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use la app por un año. Al inicio todo muy bien, funcionaba perfecto, pero al cabo de 6 meses comenzó a fallar. Cada vez que intento editar un documento, una nota, cualquier cosa dentro de la app, produce que se caiga y deba intentarlo unas 4 a 5 veces antes de porfin conseguir editar una nota. Es por esto que decidí cancelar la suscripción y obviamente transferiré mis archivos a una app mejor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreliable syncing that sometimes caused images to not load. 50 note limit for free users was the last straw. Switching to OneNote. Goodbye and good riddance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed with the constant pop up ads, paywalls, and limits on notes. I've used this app for years and it used to be great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be useful, but now their efforts to price gouge have made it worthless. They got people used to the functionality and then said ""now you're only allowed one notebook"" after you've created several. There's no way to move your notes into one book. It's awful. Just use One Note or any of a million alternatives. Don't pay the ridiculous prices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ads every other click. Not worth getting unless you pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had paid subscriptions and *was* likely to again. But new restriction on... Text documents means goodbye forever. A notetaking app is easy to replace, and so it's pretty bonkers to turn that product into ransomware. Trust & security matter."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote since 2017 on a free plan, and I'm so disappointed that the latest updates mean that I can't keep all of my notes without paying the subscription fee. I would have loved some advance notice, so that I could look for alternative options. Additionally, it's now so hard to use without paying (I keep getting pop-ups to pay £79.99)I'll be switching to a different app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many annoying pop-ups asking for premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not free anymore!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frustrating New Year Popups and now on top of this 50 noted limit. Disappointed, Have to look for alternatives. I was using it since 2014, it was my go to note app but not anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pay ads and limit to free make it unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a paid user if this app for quite a few years. Periodically, the app would quit working in a variety of ways. Right now searching is messed up and entry of new notes is not working. It's becoming frustrating and intolerable. Considering quitting this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. It is impossible to cancel and is an absolute scam."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"couldn't take screenshots"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Noticed recently that they limit to 50 notes only for free users. Its like forcing free users to buy the plan. Will be leaving evernote. Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's a pity! I've used this app for over 10 years, since 2013. For a month, it too much oftenly keeps me noticed Paying for subscribtion. Now I can't create New notes. Uninstalling and finding other alternative note may be a good solution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Spammed to upgrade constantly. I have considered upgrading from the free version, but with the way they advertise at you constantly it's a no, I get at least three messages about it every time I open the app and before I can do anything. I'm not going to reward that behaviour! So I'm migrating my notes and saying goodbye. I've been looking for a good notes app for a while, and this isn't it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I previously reviewed this app as really good but the latest change makes it useless unless you pay for it. And the price is way too high for what it does. Even worse, the update now restricts to 50 notes in total. This means loyal users that supported the app from the begining have to delete all their notes and saved data or pay at least 80 quid a year to keep them. A ridiculous, alienating and greedy monetisation by force, the developer should take a long hard look at the pay structure!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this since 2013. Always been great. Now it's relentlessly pushing the paid service and it's limited the number of notes you can create. A real shame. I've copied and pasted all my important things into a different app and won't be using Evernote again. I would have been happy to pay for the service if it hadn't been so bad with the last few updates. Unending prompts to pay, crashes and just all round worse than it has always been. An awful shame and a massive irritation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use the free plan at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using over 5 years, all I can say is the amount of pop-ups is very consistent. The loading of data has been taking longer and longer until it's best to restart the app in order to work smoothly. Time to transit to other note trackers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Infested with annoying ads for the 90$ a year note pad app. Tons of good note apps out there..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for 7 years to store writing. I have dozens of notesbooks and hundreds of notes total. It was free to use until now. They want $170/year. That is nuts for something I basically use as a diary. I'm hunting for a replacement app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app ive ever used in my life. absolutely stupid 50 note limit and one notebook limit. and you have to pay over 100 dollars to do anything more?????? so incredibly pointless. thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for a long ride, but they recently limited the number of notes you can make to just 50. I understand that they can't be free forever, but $15/month is really steep for an app that shares the same features most phones are already equipped with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to force me to pay. I'm moving my notes and deleting the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a Great app, but now it has a lot of incredibly annoying and intrusive offers that are ridiculously over priced. Throw in growing restrictions that force you to delete old notes or pay up, and you get an app company that needs a stiff reprimand. I will be looking for a new note app unless they change things."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notebook and note limits makes this app completely and utterly worthless now thanks a lot you goons you're crazy if you think I won't just buy some scrolls and a quill it would still be money better spent than using it on this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier it given access to two devices and now they are asking for premium to use it on mobile. furthermore, the premium is costing almost a new app development. I would rather pay a developer to create fresh app than paying whopping 4000/- annum."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They app suffocates you with their own ads now trying to get you to spend money on their plans. Terrible... Don't invest"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I enter, it flashes a couple of times for no reason. I don't experience it in any other apps. Besides, the home page is bloated, the monetization is intrusive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for years, now it tells me I have too many notes. States that the free max is one notepad with 50 notes in it. I have one notepad with only 9 notes & it tells me I can't create more unless I pay a subscription. Time to find a new note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely garbage app, out of nowhere they change their ""plans"" so the free version only supports 1 notebook & 50 notes, laughable. Moving everything off their platform, do not download!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE THIS APP! EVERNOTE NOW CHARGE $129/YR AND NOW I GOING TO MIGRATE ALL MY NOTES TO GOOGLE. F THIS BS COMPANY!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basically, Evernote got greedy and is not allowing me to take notes any more. Shame. No, I am not gonna pay for a note taking app, you will need to work on your business model."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2012, previously a 5* free product with the option to upgrade it you wanted more, but are now cutting back their free account to pretty much nothing after already limiting more and more. Now app is bloated, poorly optimised and keep getting the upgrade now message all the time despite the I'm sure I don't want this offer and won't see it again. Sad farewell, but time to move on. No longer recommend this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ABYSMAL. THE NEW ownership is ABHORRENT. This app USED TO BE one of my favorite apps I used ALL the time. An ADHD dream of an organization app. I had my entire life's work on this digital notebook.. and now it's completely unusable because they dismantled all their baseline parameters."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but the free version has recently been pared down to nearly nothing, and the subscription price they want for a mediocre note storage app is nuts. Used to be a good app but it's pretty much junk now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beyond disappointed. I've used Evernote as a note app on my phone for years. I opened it the other day and it says I need to pay to access my notes. No thank you. I will be finding another note app for my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After a near decade of use. This app has slowly progressed to more aggressive predatory subscription practices. Free use now has a 50 note max. This includes notes that have been deleted. Best to find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not even sure how many years I've been using evernote. My life is in this app. To be locked out by a paywall is of course shameful. Last year I decided to try out the premium. I paid something like 45$ for a year which felt like a waste since none of the premium features were useful to me. The premium is now 3X AS EXPENSIVE. Too bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will most likely be forced to give up and move to another app. I endured the incresing aggresive messages trying to force me to buy premium which were using dark ux patterns like hiding the x button or not clear cancel button but now they lmited the free notes to 50 and I am not able to make any new note. I am sorry but you do not convince people by force. I am quite disappointed after using the app for quite many years it got worse and worse instead of better. Also often sync problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They made some recent changes. Limiting the numbers of notes I could create per month was really limiting. Although I understand the app is for profit, the subscription price was excessively high. I highly doubt that high of a price is necessary with the large user base. But on top of it, opening the app would get you a pop up asking if you would like to subscribe. This was infuriating. Left to use another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This version often accidentally stop while audio recording"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great App. Now it's unusable unless you give them money every month. Because I've used it from the early days, I already had over 100 notes saved. The limit for a free account is 50 (at least now it is) Making it unusable unless I delete older notes. A lot of my notes contained images, these will not show up for some reason? Having trouble loading even recent notes and when I back out it minimizes/closes the app. Wouldn't pay for it, even if I could afford it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years only to now be informed I can't create new notes without paying a fee. Not to mention the irritating constant pop ups for the subscription. I'll be jumping ship when I find another good notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Look elsewhere for a trustworthy note app. I hate what they have done to Evernote. Springing a simultaneous price hike and basically making the free version unusable was devastating. I trusted them for years. I would be willing to pay a reasonable amount but the way they handled this transition has destroyed all my faith in their future behavior. I also imagine they will go out of business after upsetting so much of their customer base. So I don't trust them to store my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What do you mean I'm limited to just ONE notebook and 50 pages now!?!? This is ridiculous! You guys have become money hungry, I'll be using another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update Error"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good when free. Now wants $ to create more notes... 🖕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They quietly introduced a 50 note limit for free users, AND after various sales. Not so much as a courtesy email from them! To add insult to injury; despite rejecting the pop-up many times, offers keep coming up for the premium version. I'm now not interested!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Become worst now a days. Demanding purchase. They have set a limit of 1 notebook and 50 notes only. I am neither allowed to move and create new notes, even within the limit of 50 notes. Worst experience, best example of greedyness for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but recent versions have introduced so many frustrating bugs into what used to be a very easy, intuitive experience. Poor QA. Downgrading to a 1 star years later - QA and user experience has gotten worse. On top of that, they have now decided to cut off the ability to create new notes unless you pay an expensive yearly subscription fee, AND they bombard you with upgrade prompts every time you use the app. Leaving this app ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After YEARS of using Evernote, I'm walking away. They are constantly bombarding you with ads to upgrade to their outlandishly priced paid version, recently they have capped the number of notes and notebooks you can have as a free user and tbh, the interface is clunky at best. Moving on to more efficient pastures and deleting this app today. Bye Evernote, good luck with user retention ✌🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As others have mentioned, it started off good years ago and I didn't have any complaints. Now, advertisements for the pro version every time you open the app, along with a massive downgrade on any free perks. I wouldn't have a problem paying for an app normally but to see the way the devs are going about it is just too much. Migrating away and probably not coming back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to sign in after update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has become utterly useless and I'll be uninstalling Evernote for good after 11 years (I've already switched to Joplin). I've never been committed this long to any other app or digital service before and it's really sad to finally have to part ways with Evernote. Nota per i miei compatrioti (che immagino essere i primi - e forse gli unici - responsabili della politica commerciale dell'azienda): capisco che la redditività sia il primo obiettivo, ma state cagando fuori dal vaso."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others I've used this app for years and have hundreds of notes so to be told very suddenly that I can't add anymore is very disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app. Minus rating. Please don't install this.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's gooooooooood"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To many popup forcing me to go premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sudden change!! Ridiculous limit!! I have used Evernote for years. I wouldn't mind paying for it but the monthly fee is absolutely ridiculous for simple note taking app. It's almost the same price as a YouTube subscription and has bugs and a dull interface. Recently it has become so slow and crashes multiple times. Now today I check my app and I can no longer create new notes! I'm limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes in the free version. Ridiculous! I will change to a different app. Smh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience. I loved Evernote app in the past. That is the reason I am using it till now. But I am getting really frustrated and irritated everytime premium options popup and the loading time for notes and lags. Please donot use this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total trash. Very buggy when opening notes. Now it makes you pay for 50+ notes. I have 240+ notes and can't make more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once my favourite app has now fallen into the category of apps one should avoid, I love to write and used for writing, now it says I can make a note cause now I've to buy premium, to make notes apparently, the UI has gone from worst to worse than worst, I can select multiple notes to delete or move, everytime I press the back button on a note the app closes, from my favourite app it's become a nuisance rn."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"i have been a user since 2017 because it was free and secure but now i can only save 50 notes which limits me greatly since i already have around 100 notes saved. im sorry to say but it should atleast have 200 notes available. A 1 year deal is around 4k. for that price id rather buy another permanent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After having used this platform for nearly 15 years. The free version has now capped at one notebook and 50 notes. Years of music lecture notes poems ideas thoughts, now locked behind a paywall. May this platform fall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a 10+ year user, I am really pissed off the devs are ruining the app over greed. You literally can't open the app without 2 to 3 pop up full page ads interrupting you, with ""a limited time offer"" and a ""are you sure you don't want to take advantage?"" After each one. I shouldn't have to click 6 buttons to just get to my notes. Time to find a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wish I could say I love this app but after 5 years of use they have gone down hill and are caping you at notes now and bombard you with ads non stop. It's terrible, I used to love this app now it's just a huge inconvenience to use! Will be finding a new solution"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: this has gone from obnoxious to absurd. Have to dismiss ""can't get this offer back"" upgrade demands every 3 or 4 clicks. The app is completely unusable to do the constant effort to get me to pay $129 annually to maintain 20MB of text notes. I actively despise this app and how they are treating a customer that has used them from day 1. I would never pay that much money for an app that is this kind of garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way to kill your user base. Do all companies think that they can charge their customers a subscription fee? And then a year later: they are going to enable ads, offer a plan without ads to entice customers, but keep the pricing intact for the base subscription. Fast forward 3 years and the business shuts down/gets bought out & restructured/scrapped. There are very few orgs that can reliably pivot to that strategy. A note taking app cannot. There are sufficient alternatives available. Cheers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"wont login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of using, found out the new free plan is one notebook, fifty notes; I'll be moving to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote. Hello Notion. Too restricted for novice user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE (12/27/23): I've moved to Notion after Evernote enforced a 50 note max for free accounts. BYEEEE! . I've used Evernote since 2011, and the last decade of my life is in this app. Unfortunately, the quality of this app has gone downhill in the past two years. The app is often slow and not responsive, especially when saving large notes. The app often hangs or lag when saving notes, and times where the app ""forgets"" bits of the note when saving or loading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ENDLESSLY DISAPPOINTED. I've used evernote for YEARS and now I can't make a single note more without paying for Premium, which quite literally gives me nothing else. ALL YOU PEOPLE DO IS DISAPPOINT but I've stuck around. Now I'm finally out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been with evernote since 2012, have been a paying customer for several of those years. With the latest update introducing a limit on the number of notes for Free tier, I've now have no choice but to consider another note taking app. Disappointing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They disabled the ability for me to create notes overnight"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"12/2023 edit. This app is just ads for premium, and they have restricted making new notes. Even if I delete some, I'm still at ""the limit"". Total garbage now. I'll be moving my notes to another app. The new update removed features that a lot of people use, and drastically changed the functionality of the app and its widgets. This update basically makes evernote worthless for how I used it. Which sucks, I've loved this app thru multiple phones now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You all are are crazy if you think your app is worth $130 a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Missing option to edit encrypted notes, UX is not the greatest, swipe right closes notes which happens a lot by mistake, limited editing options. Missing proper calendar. Update 2023: sudden price spike is just not justified, the app is not worth the cost!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to get a different app for notes. Suddenly my hundreds of notes exceed the max of 50 and I can't make notes at all. Went from a useful free app to garbage in one day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience, everything is behind a paywall. I have 16 notes and the limit is 50 but still doesn't allow me to add new notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over 10 years using app. Since update (10.4). Giving up on Evernote! They remove features including a widget option that had note previews. Also the current widgets are not dark themed. Annoying since ALREADY HAD IT and rolled back in progress!!! Starting to look for alternatives. 2023 Update - now with 10.6 free version limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook. I understand limiting free versions, but taking away features after 10 years of using an app. Terrible experience after a long time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's unbelievable the notes are now limited. Obvious that you need to make money. But the less feature was okay. But it's totally insensible to make the notes limited as a big amount of users (who are likely to upgrade later on like me) will go for an alternative. Surely you lost my love. That was a good journey. Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've loved and used Evernote for years, but the lagginess of the handwriting input feature is atrocious on my Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I'll happily update this rating to 5 stars when it gets fixed. EDIT December 2023: RIP Evernote. New ownership killed it with bad decisions. I'm using Notion now 👍🏻👍🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was a good note app, but it keeps glitching my notes. It will write the same sentence twice and it takes forever to fix. Example being: The wedding will be on September 29th. Arrive early to help set up around 10.The wedding will be on September 29th. Arrive early to help set up around 10. For someone who writes a lot on this, it takes 40 plus minutes out of my day. Please Fix this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's the worst, do not use. It's so slow and is always trying to upsell premium features. the pop-ups have gotten so bad that I can barely use it because it keeps asking me if I'm sure I don't want this ""special offer""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You're ruining the app! What's this 1 notebook and 50 notes limit guys??? That's so bad. I loved this app using it from many years, but now I'm leaving. I've shifted to Notion & One Note, they are pretty cool apps. Thanks for letting me install those apps for the 1st time, they are super awesome! There are always free alternatives. You guys keep your premium subscriptions to yourself!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was by far the best notes app out there until they locked everything behind an absurd $140 paywall. This app is no longer worth it whatsoever and I recommend installing any other notes app. Really disappointed in the Evernote team :-("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another long-time user jumping ship for a program that doesn't render itself useless unless you shell out a ridiculous amount to get past its paywall. Greed will be your downfall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Crash everytime created a note. Samsung S7 plus tablet user here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is glitchy, won't allow new notes even when under the 50 note limit. No actual support is offered unless you pay to use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"paid version, glitchy, slow. cancelling paid version at renewal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So why does this app exsist? To make notes, right? A very basic basic funadamental function that has been taken away. Always loved this app over Notion coz' of its minimalist design, limited editing in free pack. All I needed as a student was to make my notes that's all. But you took away even the most basic use of it. Now when I have less than 50 notes still I can't make any more notes...Why? What is the purpose left of this app if it cant even let you do what its says in the name."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years, and I used to love it. However, the newest update limits you to 50 notes and 1 folder. I have over 300 notes, over 10 folders, all full of 5 years of notes. Now I can't do anything with all of it. I'm not paying $130 a year MINIMUM to have my notes that I've had for years for FREE. I can't believe y'all are screwing people over after all this time. I now have to copy and paste 5 years worth of notes to a new notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stayed loyal for a long time because notes layout was fantastic and alternatives just weren't quite right but to cut free tier down to just 1 notebook and 50 notes is a MASSIVE change. I didn't get an email about this I only saw it as I came back to my account. I'm afraid to say that this is the end for me. After 10+ years I'll be moving on. Goodbye Evernote, I wish it hadn't come to this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app has really gotten bad with some of the recent updates. Is now extremely slow and painful to use. Super spammy as well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cheap app just wants money , guess what you'll lose people like me who were loyal to your app for years. Don't be surprised later. This is your downfall !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's safe to say that the product is dead. evernote lost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are you guys purposefully trying to destroy this app? The glitches and relentless never-ending overpriced subscription ads are making what was one of the best note apps, the worst."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love ❤️ It"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote sparingly for roughly five years. The app has always been laggy, and was only better than a generic notes app in that your notes could be accessed from different devices. Today, I tried to create a note, only to learn that to have more than one notebook and 50 notes, I had to pay $130 a year. For an app that already wasn't that great in the first place (2/5). Not only will I not spend money, I'll be uninstalling the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Holy christ, this is not the way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Much like everyone else, I have used this app for nearly a decade and to have to pay MONTHLY/YEARLY for a green version of WordPad is a huge inconvenience. I understand everyone's out to make a buck but why a subscription model and not a fixed price for a premium app? I don't know man, I'll be looking for another app. If yall have any ideas, let us know in your review lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had been using this app for years and have multiple notebooks filled with hundreds of notes but suddenly greeted by a ""50 notes and 1 notebook limit reached"" telling me I now have to pay a monthly subscription to continue to use the app even though there have been 0 new features added since I downloaded. Just a money grab by greedy devs/ corporate shills. You suck."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They want to charge you to give your data to AI to train on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"We are actively watching the downward spiral of Evernote. I have used Evernote for years. They are chargimg many times more than just 3 years ago. I paid for a while, realized I wasn't using it all. So went on the free plan. 2 devices. That wasn't ideal. But doable. I am asked so many times to upgrade. So many times that I am switchimg to a different note service. There other good options. And don't have to deal with Evernote bombarding you with upgrade options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for like 12 years. Went to make a new note today and got a message saying I can't have more than 50 notes and 1 notebook in the free version. I have maybe 20-25 notes and only one notebook. And the price they want to make simple notes is insane"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many limits in free subscription. My limit reach only 1 notebook & 50 notes. Why? So frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great. Ive used it for years. Now they are charging $130/yr or I can't add anymore notes. I'd definitely pay a one time fee for this, but YEARLY at that price point is ridiculous. Its just corporate greed. Guess its time to switch my notes to OneDrive. $100 per year for the whole family plus Microsoft office products included."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Want to use the app without having to skip past 'one chance only!' ads? Tough luck, cause you'll get them every single time. Literally nobody is going to pay for this rubbish, how this app has been driven into the ground year after year is beyond me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love Evernote. I have been a subscriber for many years! Seemless and very informative updates. Thanks Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't create a note. It says I've reached my limit of 50 notes but I just downloaded and have none."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Well Evernote team, we're going to part ways. It's been a good run and many times i've considered upgrading from my free subscription, but this last change clinched it for me. Your paid subscription is just too expensive for my usage as a personal diary and small note application. Your subscription plans do not provide value for my usage and the free account cannot meet the needs required by small permanent users. And an annual Microsoft 365 Family subscription is 50% cheaper and a better value."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing users to buy subscription suddenly for more than 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Better if can support smartwatches."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version limited to 50 notes. If you're here so you can organize scenes, themes, thoughts, parentheticals, and your other errant fancies, then you're going to find the limits of the free version very quick. I don't subscribe to software. Ever. I'd consider a one-time premium fee, but not a subscription. There are other productivity apps in the sea."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting free users to only 50 notes total after over a decade of unlimited notes is really shooting yourselves in the foot. I'm not paying £80 a year to make new text notes - bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How to kill your app in record time has just been achieved. I go in to evernote as always to put in a quick little note, only to find out not only am I blocked from adding a new word, but blocked from editing any prior notes. 1 notebook and 50 notes for free, anything more pay 160$ a year subscription for a note taker when there are many other note apps around that are better? Pay for less than has been offered in the past for free? Ridiculous nonsensical price, ridiculous decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A l"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give them 0 stars. These guys are thieves. Classic bait and switch. They provide a free app for years then grab you by the short and curries. $15 a month! Screw off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly get ""Read Only"" mode so that I have to close and re-open the app, it wasn't like this before. Additional Comment in December 2023: I only have 31 notes, but I can't create a new note without buying the premium plan. Even though it is said my current free plan can add up to 50 notes. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Despicable tactics to stop you from unistalling. Downloaded w/out reading reviews (mea culpa), saw that after free trial they'd charge 3.75/week & decided to delete account (I signed via gmail) instantly. For this, you make a new evernote password which is sent to ur mail, then they request you re-sign in w/ ur mail, then they request a verification code sent to ur mail, BUT if you switch to go check ur mail for said code, they sent you back to the settings section, and so it begins again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"annoying. it sends request to buy all the time. just stop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had rated it much higher, but this app is giving me nightmares now. Just 50 notes now with latest update. This is bad at all levels. Please think about others too. Mostly students this app and you are trying to milk money from them. Hope the management realises this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app for notes and sharing. Today is all about subscription and forcing it onto you. I've deleted all my data and won't be using this anymore. I was active since 2014. Buh bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Zero customer support. I keep being told I have exceeded the number of notes I'm allowed to have, but I only have 6. Can't speak to anyone about this, no way to reach out for tech support because this app has become garbage. Don't waste your time, they'll just waste it for you by covering your screen in pop ups you can't opt out of. I'd be happy to change my review if customer service reached out to me to solve my issues, but I don't have high hopes and neither should you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I changed my mind and renewed my account! I love this app. It has so many different things you can do: scratch pad, memos, tasks, etc. just to name a few. I had lost my ph & couldn't remember where I had it, I was set to end it now I'm renewing cuz I luv this app it has everything I need all in one. Don't believe anything you read. Most reviews posted are always neg if they want to leave a response. Forget those reviews. Try it for yourself if you really want to know how it works & if for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years and I've loved it, but the most recent update has ruined it. I miss the simplicity of the older version! Now there are too many popups about upgrading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not willing to pay. No difference with other memo apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible bugs, very slow, more and more expensive. Simply awful. Used to be good but now is probably the worst note app. DELETED"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used the paid version for a little while and it was ok but just too pricey for me. Went back to the free version but inundated with offers to upgrade, that you have to close out and then also decline the ""are you sure?"" option as well. Annoying enough that I'm switching notes apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blackmailing behaviour! All of a sudden it says limit is full. Very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent update that limits free users to 50 notes is now preventing me from making new notes, even though I have less than 50 notes. This used to be the best note app but it's gotten way worse this year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The FREE plan is now LIMITED to 1 notebook and 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best, clean and simple interface app to write notes and texts and many other stuff. No Ads, No Bloatware and Unnecessary stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I love the app itself (even though it often crashes on my tablet in multi window mode), I've been using it for studying and now I'm gonna have to find another app because the way they want to get money out of people is ridiculous. 1 notebook and 50 notes?? really??? No thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Making life complex"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent change to the cap of 50 notes is just the push I needed to dump the convoluted mess this app has become"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do not like this 1 notebook and 50 page limit. Already the app is so laggs so much. It takes time to open a old note and UI is getting worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for many years. Now when reinstalling on a new phone app doesn't work and crashes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes are limited and price to pay is way too high for just a notes app!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the free version for years and it's *ok* if a little slow but now they've capped it to well below the amount of notes I have and are forcing me to upgrade...no thanks, do not recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has just changed and is forcing me to upgrade, as a new limit has been introduced, making the app unusable. Every 5 clicks is a reminder to pay, for which you need 2 or 3 clicks to ignore. This is a big push to convert non paying users to paying users, and not caring about those who don't pay. This should be a lesson for all the free apps, who attract you to their ""free"" product to later force your hand."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a bastion for efficient and intuitive notetaking, this app has seen better days. Free Evernote accounts now only have two devices rather than 4, and a hard cap for notes and uploads. Between the continual ads for upgrades, the app has not received and optimization for Android, often closing when the back button is pressed, or having technical issues syncing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having the app for over 10 years with hundreds of notes, then telling me any new notes are behind a 14.99/mo paywall ain't it. Went from a 5* app to a 1*."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using Evernote since 2015 personally i like this app but after limitations of notes .....i have to find alternative of this application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really gone down the drain. It used to just be an annoying ad every once in a while, then it became every time you opened the app, then it became you can't have any more than 50 notes now unless you upgrade. They want more than $100/yr to host less than 10 megabytes of data. Money hungry blood suckers, they've always been that way and now it's to a point of no return. Use Google Keep or Microsoft OneNote instead, free and they don't spam you every five seconds. Bye Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NO, NO, NO!!!! I, too, have used Evernote for many years. I, too, am moving my notes to another app. This one obviously is about to die. As with most intelligent people, I HATE the ""subscription model"" and when the subscription price is as ridiculous as this one, I certainly WILL NOT buy in. Do you realize that the owners of this tiny app want you to pay them more than Microsoft demands for a full family subscription for MS365?!!! NOPE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a joke. I've used this app for years, but now unless I pay $130/year.... Time for another note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"scammed me into upgrading and can't even get a person to talk about getting a refund! Has anyone been able to contact someone to get a refund????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pairing back the app after investing so much time and effort into adding my notes just to put a heavy price tag to keep what I already had feels like some sort of unfair business practice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstall this horrible app now. It was super awesome in the past but now, it starts to have all the unnecessary features that no one asks for, gitches and buggy at times. Cant even have a decent offline notepad. The past notes either take ages to load or doesn't load all together. On top of it all, it limits to 50 notes. Awful app that I'm trapped in because all my notes are stuck in it and transfering them is a nightmare."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reduced stars to minimum as I am not able to use the app at all anymore without being forced to pay for it. It is now useless to me! Will delete it as soon as I've transferred my 500+ documents to an alternate app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never had an issue with amount of notes, now they force you to upgrade to even keep 50 notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Baloney. It's now almost unusable with CONSTANT offers & ads to upgrade to something that used to be free. I'll carry a physical notepad before I drop $160 per year on an app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I think Evernote is great!!!!! I am getting to use it more and more!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update has rendered the free version of this this app useless! Reduced to just 1 notebook and 50 notes on the free version. They now demand over £70 per year for the privilege of using the paid vesion! I have several notes I can not open now, thanks to the update. Well annoyed! From 5 stars to ONE star in one go. Well done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't support rtl"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user of this app for almost 12 years. 2k notes, 130 notebooks. I have been assaulted by ads to upgrade to their paid version, but never felt urged to, as the free version gave me all I needed. That's changed. They now only allow free users 1 notebook and 50 notes. No clue if that is going to affect access to all of my current notes, but I'm moving all of my files to another service. I can't afford $78 or $130/yr. Goodbye, Evernote. It was fun while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great layout, simple and very useful. It really helps keeping things organized. But now is really annoying the amount of daily pop-ups asking you to upgrade. Only when I need to upgrade I will, not because of the nagging messages. An update to my previous review. It is no longer pleasant to use your app, this has gone beyond you trying to profit ( this is your business after all). This is now harassment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to swear by Evernote, but with the recent limitations being imposed on the amount of notes created by free accounts, I am switching back to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved evernote (free) for about 10 years and would give it 4-5 stars. I didn't really need the cloud storage or extra devices or features that required a paid subscription. However, the management has decided its a good idea to now hold existing users hostage and cripple their ability to continue using Evernote without paying $10+ a month. Existing notes are there, but cannot create anything new. Result: I am going to a competitor and will no longer recommend this to anyone. Uncool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new pricing is ridiculous as a casual user. This used to be a great app. Switched to another app that to ""Keep"" my things."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Farmer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated for 2024. I recommended this app and it was great for so many years. Now, unless you want to pay them more than $100/year you face constant pop ops, limits, up selling, and worse. I hate this app now. Do not recommend. Actively searching for better alternatives. Even the paid version wasn't worth it. They disabled the web version on apps for greed only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a heavy Evernote user since 2015 and now I'm dumping the platform. this insane price increase is way too much and just corporate greed. off to export all my data and find a new solution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for over 10 years with hundreds of notes but thinks to the new plan parameters I'm being forced to either by premium ot switch. Because I have over 50 notes I can't create new noted. Welp I guess I'll be switching. It's horrible that's how you all are doing people who have been with you from the beginning. ~A now former Evernote user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not a free user friendly anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernotes constant, aggressive advertising has turned a useful app into unusable garbage. At this point adding new notes to Evernote is unthinkable, and even accessing old notes is an annoyance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version is not usable anymore after the recent updates. Not many people are willing to pay $130 per year, while there are many other options. I'm definitely going to switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I grow up I want to be as brave as Evernote, who's pushing me to buy their premium version of the app when the free one is the slowest and buggiest app I've ever worked with."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote on most of my devices as a free user for years. Now I'm getting pushed out as a free user. Even a single tier above free is over a hundred dollars a year. I understand limiting space but not allowing users to create new notebooks. I'm just going to an alternative and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Give ""Notion"" a try if you want something that looks similar and works just as good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The program was good in the past, and then there came a time when it was not worth a dime now. Ads and etc..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am now limited to 50 notes with the free account, however I only have 32 notes yet I cannot add anymore so the 50 note limit is a lie."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just resubscribed through Google Play, paid for a year, and now it's asking me to pay again or unsync all my devices ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Money driven now forcing user to buy expensive capacity. Worse than dropbox Gmail. Time to switch to other platform. The value here isn't that worth it, doesn't link up to other work apps and functions. No accounting, video, photo management. Just notes and tasks. Lags nowadays too. Paper and pen 🖋 don't lag."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The application is so hell-bent on selling me upgrades that I can no longer use it to take notes. It is therefore useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was my go to app for notes and stuff. Never thought that it won't allow me to add a basic note. Asking for subscription at every step, it has become very annoying. Who knows- after few days we won't be able to view our notes without subscription. Better to switch to another app. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. I used this app for years and recommended it to a number of friends. But I am now limited to only 50 notes on the free version and having multiple hundreds already saved just means I can't really do anything. I'd be glad to pay 5 bucks a month to have some notes saved. But 15 dollars is really to much for what they use to give for free... I really did like it as a very simple note app in years past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great back in the day. Now it's just constant pop-ups and ads for paid features at ridiculous prices. And device limits lol... Insanity. Currently seeking an alternative now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Left a 5 star review in 2012. It's now been downgraded to a 1 star. Greedy devs have made it unusable. Uninstalling after being a user for over a decade!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am appalled to know that now it has a 50 notes limit, and not only that, but its annoying reminders of buy now and offers makes me want to uninstall it even more. I will of course migrate everything to another notes app, greed will be your downfall"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lately app became so trashy: it lags all the time, forgets to save the notes, sometimes basic ""back"" button is not working, not speaking about the fact it didn't remind me about ending of my free premium trial, which it promised to remind. And it's totally NOT worth the money. EDIT: Wow, my users experience've got even worse! Adding 50-notes limit, after making more than 150 notes is just ridiculous nonsense. Meanwhile, not a single upgrade was made. Not even a new font. Such a horrible attitude"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new limits imposed on free users is app suicide. I guess the constant bombardment to upgrade wasn't enough and now they do this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Became unusable, 140usd per year is way too much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After making notes for years in evernote, overnight you simply make it unable to use evernote anymore for free. Quite violent. Bye then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"added limits to free notes and notebooks. no thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Not a good idea"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It is a high gross app. As a long time user, I must edit my review of a 5. Now I'll be generous and give it a 3. I had a paid account and would think simple/complicated view price points would satisfy almost all the complainers, including me. Hard to navigate menus has made it a second class note app. Android 12 and Win 11 OS. Reconvened 12/24/23: Way too expensive to justify after more than 8 years. (Mostly not from Google Play) Will be moving on. Was recurring @ $39.95/yr, with all I needed +."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i would give this a zero the free version of this app is ridiculous i have been using this app for 3 years and wouldnt mind paying a one time fee for it but not 15 a month for it the layout is amazing but this a big but it not worth 15 a month charge a one time fee and stop trying to make people pay 130 a year you are going to Completely lose business."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a useful app, but now I can't even navigate without having to decline a bajillion upgrade offers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is SO SAD how pressed for $$$ they are, you can't MOVE exsitng notes from one exsisting folder to another without paying money! Not to mention the free version does not allow you to export your notebooks or notes. Essentially my information is being held hostage unless I pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it since 2012. Now I'm either limited to 1 notebook (one!) or charged €99 per year. This is ridiculous, good bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Who ever had the great idea to alienate people who have used the app for 10 years+, I hope they are happy. If this isn't resolved soon, farewell one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I like your app and I am using it since 2019. You are giving 60mb monthly which is very good. But now you asking to pay for that also. Can you change that, and provide the free plan again ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"constant subscription harassment - i am so sick of the interrupting popups about upgrades I don't want. it is infuriating. i said no. these popups occur every time i try to interact, multiple times. I'm going to delete this godforsaken app at this rate. its base features are not worth this nuisance and so obviously neither are its ""upgraded"" ones. I've come to despise this stupid app because of this endless annoying harassment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I enjoyed it for a couple of years but now its asking for mandatory paid update to premium with no other away around it. Time to uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this for years, I've suddenly got to upgrade to create any new notes. I even deleted a couple of old ones in case I'd reached a limit, but no, seems there is no free version anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just made it so you can't keep more than 50 notes - basic text notes no less - without paying them yet another forever-subscription. OF $130 PER YEAR That's like the price of a whole streaming service or a gym membership. That they want for sticky notes on your phone? Are they insane?!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my review back in 2012... ""Great UI. Easy to use. Makes life more simple, and that's something we all need. Get it.' And I'd been using it for 2 years at that point. Today Evernote thinks that I'm not worth keeping around. After nearly 14 years of using this app it is now totally unusable - 1 notebook and 50 notes? Are you kidding me? I surpassed that limit back in 2010 when I started using this app - today I've got to pay for basic features... Clearly it's time for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Find another alternative! They retroactively reduced the amount of notes I could have and removed the export tool to force customers into paying for service. You can't get any support unless you pay for it. I've been a customer for 11 years and that's how bad Evernote has gotten. Find another option. Evernote is a horrible company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly bugs out, especially when moving between notebooks. Not to mention the ads are TERRIBLE! Like, if I open this app 20 times in a week, I have to decline the ""upgrade to premium!"" prompt at least 15 times. Extremely annoying when you're just trying to pop in to write a quick note before you forget. Go somewhere else. Evernote used to be awesome. Not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible glitchy lags"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"DAILY requests to sign up for the premium version. Every day? Good grief."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Automated hyperlinks are just so annoying and constant reminders to go the paid versions"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote suddenly cut its free plan down to 50 notes maximum and one notebook. They ask for $18/mo, which is a ridiculous price for a note-taking app. I've been using this app for almost 10 years, but I'll be moving on now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I can't find my phone number"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using it for free for years , now limited to 50 note only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version is largely a waste of time now. It's now being limited to a single notebook and 50 notes. I already had 175 notes and now all of a sudden I can't make any more? Looks like I need to find a new app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This harassment to switch to a paid plan is unheard of. If it continues I'll uninstall the app altogether."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has become unusable, no functions work, nothing. Can no longer open any of the word docs because it wants to convert them to pdf and asks money for it. This is insane. And I even pay for premium!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using Evernote for many years, now it says I can only have 50 notes. The problem is I only have 11 notes yet it still won't let me add one without upgrading. So even with it popping up ads to upgrade every time I do anything, it won't honor the free quantity allowed. Why trust the pay version when the free is purposely broken?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The fee version was awesome. 10yrs later and they want HOW MUCH for the paid version? Not happening guys."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"REPORTED THE APP. DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP! Their weak security allowed someone into my account and they make contacting them IMPOSSIBLE. I'm locked out and will not trust logging in again with a new password. k damn way. Their security obviously sucks. NO MATTER WHAT I DO, I CAN'T DELETE THE ACCOUNT. YOUR ACCOUNT INFO HAS BEEN COMPROMISED THROUGH THIS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Evernote service has become absolute garbage! They have deactivate all my devices and effectively locked me out of my account, after attempting to migrate my mobile app to my new phone. BEWARE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for years and have been a subscriber for over a year. I primarily used it for teaching and speaking notes, but recently every time I try to open a new note that I have typed on my PC, the app crashes on my tablet and I have to download/reinstall every time. I have written support but I got no real help, besides the suggestion to reinstall every time. I will be canceling my subscription and I will move on to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app daily for years and years for everything from grocery lists and work notes to song ideas and recipes. Suddenly, the free version is basically completely unusable... And at a cartoonish, $130 / year for premium... I'll be moving on from Evernote. Look elsewhere this one isn't what it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is now unusable. I've had this app for years and I have a number of notes under different notebooks. Less than the free use of 50 total apps, but because I have more than one notebook I can't consolidate or add a new note without paying the subscription fee. I will be finding a new app and deleting this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I originally paid for this service, but now , changed, their policies to subscription.... way over price. Will be moving to one note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every so often Evernote would entice you to premium, fair enough. But everytime I open it lately, it asks, too much Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New subscription requirement makes the app useless. For 10 years I used this app as a catch-all for everything: work, to-do lists, personal notes, a place to draft emails and texts, everything. I had 5 notebooks and close to 200 notes in the app. And how does Evernote reward its longtime users? By cutting down their access and forcing them to pay for the exact same service that was offered for free since 2008. There are no new features! Same old stuff, but now you have to pay! No thanks!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be a fantastic option that allowed me to store and share my recipes, checklists, notes, etc. Past couple years they have taken away more and more free (legacy) options to try and force you to pay. This is a failed business plan on a product that has been getting buggier than before. $130 a year, it is not even remotely worth it. Way to kill a great app by corporate greed...GOOD BYE Evernote, One Note WINS, not looking back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for over a decade and loved it until the most recent update. Now it's telling me I need to subscribe to have over 50 notes. I might not have an issue with that except for the fact that it's ridiculously over priced!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Service has gotten worse over last 2 years. Time to say godbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been married to Evernote Premium since 2008 at least, and though it's been rocky at times, as most relationships are, EN knows me. We separated when the price went up to $129 for Personal and I started looking around for new fish in the sea, and I found a couple but they don't share the memories I have in Evernote as well, so I'm back.. at 40% off of course, will live together another year and see how it goes, but for now I feel like I can exhale, going back with my old friend and partner❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible update. I've been using Evernote for years, and I use it to keep my business organized. Now all of a sudden I have to pay an outlandishly overpriced subscription? I would pay a one time fee, but $130 a YEAR? Unbelievably greedy. Even after I deleted a ton of notes to get under the 50 note limit, it still says I'm over the limit and won't let me create any new notes. I will be moving my notes to a more reasonable app. So disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since Sept 2015. I had given this app a 5* review because it really was the best note app available. The features were great & the app ran beautifully. However, today I have moved all of my notes & notebooks off the app. I will never use Evernote again. Over the years, the marketing pop-ups have become absurd. The app is buggy, they continuously cut free features & put them behind a pay wall. The basic app is a joke. Good job on losing a loyal user. I'm disappointed in you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is generally good but now they want to charge me to create new notes. I already have several notebooks and over 100 notes. Why should I pay you to create more, when I'm already over your new limit? I guess it's time to find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointing Recent Software Update Free users are now restricted to a maximum of 50 notes per account. I have been using Evernote for many years, primarily for shopping lists, for which it was excellent. I even wrote some of my undergraduate dissertation on it whilst out walking in the countryside. Since using it for my travel checklists, I have never forgotten to pack anything. It will be sad to see it go, but I cannot abide by this 50 note restriction."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is why I hate paid software & subscriptions like Evernote and MyFitnessPal, etc. Support them in the beginning when they are new & need to gain users, use the product on free plan as per terms, upgrade when/if needed to ADDITIONAL / NEW / USEABLE innovations & functionality, (not for the same free plan services originally given), contribute to the so they can improve and refer people... Then they charge you for the free plan and hold data hostage. 50 messages limit imposed=useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has taken a nose dive. The user experience is constantly annoying with the offers to buy a subscription that seem intended to make the app unusable. The limitations now on the free version make it virtually unusable. I would pay $25/yr for up to 250 notes and 2 devices. But otherwise I'm moving to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I usually don't do this but I've been a long time user of this app. Advocated to friends and family about how much I love the app. Today I decided to do some Christmas shopping, and run into some issues when I went to try to create a shopping list. After being a user for about 8+ years, I am now only limited to one notebook and 50 notes. When I already have three and about a hundred fifty notes. This is a bit backwards to me. Will not be using this app further."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App went downhill after sale of the company. Look elseware for note taking"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app now only allows 50 notes before you need to start paying a subscription fee. This is ridiculous, and I will be transferring my notes to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$160 to use your simple app. Hah!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user. I am unable to access my account. I could not reset my password because it says my account with that email does not exist. I tried creating an account with that email, but it says that email already has an account. I had been using the free version for years. I submitted an email about the login issue on 12-19-2023. I will update this review when I get a response. On 12-20-2023, I received an automated response with a list. My problem was not on the list. Buyer beware."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you for forcing me to move hundreds of my personal notes from Evernote to elsewhere before Christmas. Why was it necessary to introduce your new greedy business model for free users only 1 month before Christmas? 50 notes and only one notebook limit for free users, its pathetic. 2490 HUF (around 6,5 EUR) monthly plan for this buggy, slow Evernote app with returning sync issues is way overpriced. I'll pay your competition instead, because they give me more value for my money than you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version of this app has become unusable. You can't do anything without a dozen double confirms that you don't want their stupid offers. Switching my stuff to another free note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New ads popping up make it a terrible app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sad to see a once good app go down so badly. First, I started to get annoyed at the frequent pop ups to ""upgrade"" at a ridiculous price. I wanted to file user feedback without needing to go via the Play Store, but it's impossible: the feedback button won't work. And now, this new 50 notes limit with an insane subscription price. Why would anyone pay that much for a note app? Feels like they just want to let it die and until then, count on lazy users to drop them a few bucks. Farewell, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be great, they got greedy! Find an app that doesn't try to charge you $125 every time you open the app. After almost 10 years I'll be removing this app from my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What good is the app when many of my notes won't open on my phone?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app for organizing, but very recently (and unknown to me) it switched to only allowing 1 notebook and 50 notes. Since I have multiple existing notebooks, I tried to move notes to one to consolidate, but the app won't let me. I also can't copy them to a note in a singular notebook bc the app won't let me make new notes. Since I'd have to delete notes anyway to get under the app's new restrictions, I'm just going to delete the app to go elsewhere ✌🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been a user for over 10 years and it's been good. I am now ditching it because as of Dec 2023 you are now limited to 50 notes, Microsoft onenote is what I'm switching to as this app is now basically useless for me as I already have over 50 notes. Hoping I'll be able to easily export my old notes to the Microsoft app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Massively hiked their prices and it's super difficult to export notes. Stay clear, there is much better out there!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I tried to use the app for the first time in a while and was presented with so many upgrade to premium prompts that the experience was dreadful. Constantly having to dismiss dialogues to try and look up something quickly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for 12 years but after the recent update and limiting free use to 50 notes and wanting a ridiculous price to use more than 50 notes is a joke. Uninstall. I'm now copied my notes over too ""standard notes"" app. I would have stayed with Evernote if price was reasonable but hayho."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ads show you to upvrade every 5 seconds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"After the update of your application, the current situation is very good, it is convenient to work. The very good thing is that if you open the same notes on both mobile and desktop and select anything from the desktop, it gets selected(in real time) from the mobile as well.Seeing such features it really feels like we are using a high class application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much ""limited"" offers. It's making free side of app unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Alot of sync issues & takes forever to load. After recent update, they started forcing people to upgrade to paid version in order to save more notes & notebook when that was not the case for many years. They should limit functions for free version instead of using such dirty tricks in limiting number of notes and notebook at $150/annum? Especially when the app is so unstable in syncing, losing data often, taking ages to open & load everytime regardless of Internet speed. Goodbye FR!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since early 2018 and have hundreds of notes in it. My use of the app coincided closely with dating my now fiance and have tons of history through our college years where I'd write about various things. This app absolutely sucks now since every time I've used it for at least the past year I have to click through mutile BS ads trying to get me to pay a ton of money to write simple text on a page and store it LOL, GET OVER YOURSELF."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2014 and use it every day. I have hundreds of notes! I thought this was a safe place, but not anymore. I now can't use it unless I pay $130 a year! I'm so disappointed in this app. No warning, just done. What a joke. I'll be finding a new trustworthy and honest app very soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit is the terribly wrong decision"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHAT A DECEPTION !!! Been using this app for YEARS ! They kept on HARRASSING me to upgrade and I was good with the basics ! Now? I can't even add a note nor a notebook without PAYING !!! I cannot believe this !!! I've been loyal to this app for YEARS and this is how they decide to deal with their longtime loyal users? Bye ✌🏾"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good note taking app even for free users (Just lack of more functions compared to premium users). But now they only limits free users to 1 notebook with 50 notes. Better alternatives on the app store"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long story short I had this yrs ago was gonna check it out, til I started reading comments from users that really like this app and are distraught. 10 plus years that's a relationship that these ppl had with yall.. I could never do business with someone who treats LOYAL users like that... I mean at least you could of did something for the ppl that been here like special not just a damn first time user.. I hope they all left yalls dog 🐕 butt.. lol.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest update that forces you to buy the premium version for more than 50 notes - Evernote will lose out many users. You are not the only note taking software in the market. Either change your policies else users are gonna change you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Recently it was unreliable and constantly nagged you to spend money. Now it *will not let me create any more notes* without paying $130. Guess I have that motivation to find something better now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I absolutely adored this app. I wrote my stories, dreams, fanfics, all I could here, but now apparently notes are limited and I'm unable to continue using this app. I wrote over 2.1k notes overall and suddenly it's capped to 50 notes 💀 Big sad. I mean I love this app so maybe I would have paid if I wasn't broke and if there weren't free alternatives 😂"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have to downgrade my score. It's such a great app but they keep killing all the free features. It's pretty much unusable now unless you want to shell out $140/yr. I'll say it again: They need a medium tier option. Otherwise they are going to keep losing customers. I've switched over to Joplin. They have both free and $25/yr options and honestly, I like it better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the best app ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"berbayar"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years, but suddenly I'm being told that I'm limited to *one* notebook and 50 notes unless I pay £80 a year! Are you having a laugh, Evernote?! Read the room, Devs or the mass exodus will continue as everyone else decides it's time for another app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally the worst taking note app on Android. Even the default Samsung app is better. Or even better, use Obsidian."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Приложение деградирует с каждым годом, и решил наконец перейти на другое приложение. Кажется, от того приложения, которым когда-то начал с удовольствием пользоваться, остался только классный логотип. Сильно тормозит (чего уж точно не должно быть нигде, в особенности в приложении для заметок), куча хлама. Последней каплей стало ограничение количества блокнотов и заметок в бесплатной версии."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Give me a cheaper paid option and I might take it. 100 Euros a year for just text notes (my use case) is ridiculous!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote, how I wish I can get back your 2020 app... Since 2021, all your update and upgrades are just clogging the very essence of the note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worked perfectly for many years but you ruined it with your ridiculous payed plans! Shame, it's completely useless now!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would have paid $2-$3/month for the old free package, I went to upgrade just to give them money bc I used the product & liked it (I only needed the free version but wanted to pay them something once i started making money), but the cheapest option was outrageously priced. And now with this 1 notebook limit, I've moved to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't know what business analytics think of, how developers done this but the app is getting worse and worse. I've been using it since 2016 and at that time the app worked much stable and convenient. I think if nobody would touch it during the last 4 years it would be even better, every change made is just terrible. Upd: about limit 50 notes. You became too greedy, but there is a good news that similar apps will benefit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am so disappointed. I love the app in general, but the fact that you're hiking the price SO much for premium is such a turnoff. Then I try to keep the free version, therefore deleting it from one of my devices but you only give me the option to delete from the device I'm currently on (and subsequently I can't delete it so i only have the option to upgrade for $130).... bad business and I'm out. I deleted your app and will find something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I always enjoyed the convenience of the app. Now all of a sudden I can't have more than 50 notes in the free version and only 1 notebook."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Longtime user here used to use evernote alongside the games Ive played for the completionist in me. Hundereds of notes plenty of notebooks that friends and I would coordinate with. Evernote is a great app in its own right but the newly imposed limite of fifty notes and one notebook unless you pay a subscription fee of 15 a month has killed it for me. I will be transfering my notes to one note same functionality without the fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a casual Evernote user for many years, I enjoyed transferring my data across devices and platforms. Over time the app's advertising has become more intrusive; now I get a popup covering my whole screen every time I open the app or want to write in an existing note, and I can't even make new ones. Seems like a cash grab exit scam to me. This app is not worth anywhere near $150/year subscription fee it will constantly harass you for if you use it. So long, Evernote. Sad state."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Note limit 🥴 Uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage, $130 to use it now? Hell no"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote USED to be a great app and has quickly gone down hill. To write a note used to load immediately. Lately it takes 30 seconds to a minute to load. Evernote used to let you write unlimited notes for free and I took hundreds of notes. Now you can write like a dozen then they want to charge you $120 per year! Crazy. $120 to take notes??? I'll be finding a new app to write my notes. Goodbye Evernote. You were good the last 8 years but now you are basically useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is all about converting their customers into premium customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't create more then 50 notes. Paid plan also expensive. It's time for find alternative of Evernote. Good bye Evernote maybe for EVER 🤣"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for more than a decade. Now I can't make any new notes unless I pay $129 annually. That's unacceptable. I would be willing to pay for a subscription, but that is far too steep. I'll be finding another solution"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2011, it used to be great. Now every time I open it it seems to get worse, first the performance dropped with very slow loading and glitches. Then the amount of upgrade pop ups started to ramp up, now it's one every time I open the app. Recently they've changed the free plan to have max 50 notes (previously it was unlimited), I have 100s from years of use so would have to upgrade (£80 a year) to write any new ones. I think it's time to uninstall. RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to love this app but it loads slow now and the constant promo popups are annoying. ""This is your last chance to get this offer!"" yeah right bud you said that 100 times already. Having to pay for what was free features sucks too but is understandable. I would pay but the functionality is very shaky which makes me not want to commit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new 50-note limit and $140 per year price tag is laughable for a service that's been totally free for 10+ years. If only the devs weren't so greedy, many would be willing to pay a smaller fee. It's been a good run, Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app doesn't allow me to log in with email addresses other than Gmail."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Love the sharing and access from anywhere. Update... downgraded to 2 stars from 5 While I still think this is a good app for note keeping and sharing, it is geared towards heavy note takers. If you need to save more than 50 notes then this is your app. Recently the app stopped allowing any note creation if you refuse to upgrade to a paid plan. I use the free version because I only use the app a few times per year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a good application, until they decided interrupt you with subscription modals"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was that?!! I've been using evernote for long now, it has been of great companion but now? It's terrible, it glitches, it's particularly difficult to delete note in batches. Also to create a new note, you'd have to waste a considerable amount of time before the new note opens. It's all ruins since that one update. Okay, now it's limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes, only? After I had like 10 notes and close to 500 notes. It's discomforting to say the list and very disappointing too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for many years now, but now it unusable and I nearly lost access to several recipes my late grandmother left me. I had to manually copy them from the app to Google docs because it wouldn't let me move them to a singular notebook or download them. Almost losing that was a gut punch. I immediately copied everything to Google and uninstalled the app. I will never use it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst customer service i have seen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Becoming unusable with a cluttered interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It crashes a lot and after writing someone when I go check it it's just not there and I just don't like it at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The sheer greed of Evernote most recent decisions is absolutely insane. Like many other recent reviews, I have had this app for 10 years and have multiple notes and notebooks. However, when trying to create a new note yesterday, I found I am no longer able to create new notes without signing up for their outrageously priced subscription. $130/ year for a notes app?? Are you serious?? You all need to get a grip on reality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be so great. Having notes that were synced across multiple devices was such a nice feature. Now, the app is practically unusable. It asks me to upgrade to the premium version every time I open the app, sometimes several times while using the app. Additionally, they recently added a small limit to the number of notes you may have with a free account. I can't make any new notes since I had more notes than the limit allows with the free account. I'm disappointed with Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's says the first 50 notes are still free. I had close to hundred notes before they started asking for an exaggerated price to be able to continue to use the app. I deleted more than 60 notes and am i still not able to use the app. Everytime I try to open it and access a note : automatically i am asked to pay close to $200 !!! Impossible to write a new note even though i am below the ""50 free notes"" ... Such a shame! Bye bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2013. Loved it until this note count reduction. I removed old notes anyway and now down to 48. It still doesn't allow adding a new note. I love the sharing capabilities of this app. But looks like time to move cause of that ridiculous yearly subscription .."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Usually good except I reached 50 notes. I've since culled it down to 47 but it still won't let me add one on free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used this app for over 10 years. just to keep notes synced between my phone and pc. never used any of the fancy options. was a 10/10 app until a couple weeks ago. i'd pay a couple bucks a month to use it like i did, but not $100+ a year. that's insane. changed my 5 star rating to 1 and migrated to notesnook. thanks for the memories."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I agree with many others, Evernote is not as good as it used to be. Looking for alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's move to limit everyone to 50 notes overnight is possibility the biggest deathwish I have seen with any app. I've been with evernote since 2012 and suddenly, I have to find somewhere else to go. The app doesn't allow me to access my attachments unless I upgrade. Worst experience EVER!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update sucks. No unlimited notes anymore?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blocking creation of new notes was the last step to loose my patience..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote. Dumb move for limiting to 50 notes. We moving to a different app now. Smh. Disrespectful and money hungry to those who had this app for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is officially dead. Please use another note app. They started charging $130 to make more then 50 notes and have more then 1 notebook. I've been using this app since 2014 and have just over 1000 notes and 10 Notebooks, so the app is now unusable for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Money hungry much?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an Evernote user for a decade at this point. Used it all through college and has been my primary notes app since then. Today after opening the app and being told I cannot create new notes due to be over the 50 note limit (I've accumulated a couple hundred at this point), I'm deciding to finally move on from this app. It's beyond disappointing and sad. So much history in these notes. $15/month is absolutely outrageous for a notes app. Evernote, get a grip."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the many dissatisfied with the new pay wall. Over $100 subscription, honestly? The app isn't worth half that as a single purchase. It's become bloated to try and become the ""blender of notetaking"" but ends up being the bug infested unholy hate child of Notepad and Google Drive. $2.99 monthly gets 100gb of storage on Drive. Do you know how many gDocs and videos and photos that is? More than I'd ever leave on even a free Evernote. Good luck selling this sinking ship."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Made it unusable after so many ads. Plus its showing I'm out of limit whereas i only have 8/50 notes limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"130 dollars a year for a note app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since I was in college, almost 10 years ago now. Slowly it's gotten more and more lonetized, to now being completely unusable as I have over 100 notes and the new ""free"" plan won't let me make anymore notes. I'm so disappointed with this company. Another victim of heavy monetization. Will definitely be moving to a new note app as soon as I can. They should've just charged a simple 1-time app fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my absolute favourite note app for years, and I've recommended it to a ton of people. But now I have to pay $200 or I can't use it anymore. I understand needing to earn a profit but with no middle ground I'm very disappointed with this huge loss."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was a long time user of the app and enjoyed it for a while. Developers recently put a 50 note limit to where you cannot write notes once you reach it. I will be moving onto a different notes app now, as it seems many people are also doing. I hope the greed was worth the mass loss of support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer free. Now only let's you create up to 50 notes (lifetime max) before forcing you to subscribe to a paid monthly plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for a decade, but now they're asking for $130/year or $15/month, which I find unreasonable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"first it started getting super spammy with a shady 2-factor decline for a subscription every time you use the app and now there's a limit. I copied out all my notes and uninstalled and now I'm using ""keep notes"" which lacks the frivolous bells and whistles and has no spam and no note limit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to creat new notes if you're free account. I m over a 10years user. Sometime pay for hard use. I guess I will move on next, I will delete account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They changed the free service and made it very limited. I am in the process of moving my notes to another app. The paid version is a bit too expensive for a note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've got more than 10 years worth of notes on this app. Saying adios now due to the Dogpoop forced monetisation and soft limits on note creation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm yet another longtime user that has close to 200 notes that was just bitten by the 50 note limit. I find the app very convenient and useful and would be willing to pay a small fee to use it, but there is NO WAY I'm paying $160/yr to keep using it. It does not provide anywhere close to that value. I'll be following the paths of others and looking for something else, even if I have to pay a nominal fee."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others, I have been a devout user of Evernote for half a decade, and I am outraged that now I need to pay to use more than 50 notes. Will be moving elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2012. It is now pulling a 50 note limit warning, and I have to pay for more. I only have 19 notes, and it won't let me make more. This is dumb. I'll be finding another app to use and getting rid of this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This had been my only note app ever since 2015. It had gone through many changes but it had been mostly functional for the use I needed for it. It has now become the worst version of itself and it's obvious how dev(s?) only care about money without giving a dime about what users need, or even making the app functional. It's a shame, but I'll be moving ten years of notes and uninstall because it's got ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had a good experience over time with this app but, like most recent reviews, the ads have become too much. I could tolerate that but now there's a limit on the number of notes I can have, and the only way to unlock it is through an expensive subscription? We're talking Netflix level costs. This is a note taking app! Jeez that's one way to lose users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: 12/21/23 - You can no longer add notes or notebooks without a subscription of $130 p/yr. I have used Evernote since early 2010's. Was a great app, kept notes in a nice SIMPLE format. Then they let somebody mess with a good thing! It's slow, not simple & clunky! FIX IT or put it back!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Read all other reviews. Long time user. I'm not paying a subscription for notes. A one time flat fee, maybe, if not absurd. Clearly Evernote is desperate to make some money. Not a good sign. This product never improves, it just continues to go down hill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is not great, with limited features, poor optimization for Android (the back button pulls you further back than you want), and bad UI. Add onto that the 200% price hike for paying users and the severe rollback of features for free users, and there's no reason to use this over other notes apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Apparently Evernote has made the choice that free users can create 50 notes and 1 notebook. In total. Not every month... IN TOTAL. I can't make new notes anymore. This is absurd. I have used a paid account for a long time, for the reason that I was happy with Evernote as a whole (even the free version). Evernote has been a huge part of my life these last years, but this will finally make it an easy choice to abandon Evernote altogether and switch to a different app/site. Sadly, but bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First time using this app was very great But now it constantly ask you to pay to use their app so much that it became capped to 1 notebook and 50 notes Really sad i had to delete the app because of this new polices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used evernote for six years now as my main writing app, accumulating well over 600 notes. Unfortunately, I've now been forced to export all of these to a different app because of the 50 note, 1 notebook limit. It was a good app, but it has gone considerably downhill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for the past 6 years. Today, when I tried creating a new note, it wouldn't allow me this option. The message was ""you are allowed between 1-50 free notes"". Could the developers of this app clarify, how 13 notes on this app is anywhere near to 50 notes? I will complain to BBB if this issue is not clarified. Stop shoving your costs down consumers throat who do not need that huge platform of note creating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2014 so I have a lot of notes. For Well over a year when opening the app a banner ad blocks my use. I click the radial that I'm sure I don't need to upgrade then proceed. Since early December I have been notified that I can no longer create notes. I deleted 87 Perminately. Evernote still says I need to upgrade to 147. a year or 14.99 a month. I just had to bite the bullet and the delete the app. Oh well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was great. They have now capped the number of notes you can make on the free version to 50 and made it virtually useless. I would gladly pay a one time fee for unlimited options but not monthly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for a decade, but with the recent change where you're only able to make a total of 50 notes unless you pay them $130 per year, I'll be switching to a different app, what a ridiculous move on their part"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has steadily become worse over the last 1 to 2 yrs. Often, opening notes displays a load animation, you have to close & reopen the note to see it. Cut, Copy, and Paste are very buggy. If you paste text onto highlighted text, it deletes several lines of text, not just the highlighted. At least once a day I have to close a screen asking me to buy a Sub when I open the App. Now, they limit you to 1 notebook & 50 notes, pay to unlock more. I won't pay for a broken app. Better, free Apps exist."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for a long time. I do have lots of notes but that is because I've had it for years. I'm told now that I have to pay $130 a year. It's not worth it. The last several months I've been having issues with is saving. The obnoxious ads trying to force me to upgrade have been beyond ridiculous. I'll be uninstalling it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"been using this app for years, the 50 notes limit is beyond awful! you guys should be ashamed of yourselves :/"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This has been a great note app for a number of years, but within the last year or two the number of workflow-interrupting ads for evenly premium (or whatever it is called) has gotten really, really obnoxious. I use the app once every couple days, and every time I open the app I have a minimum of one, sometimes as many as three, ads to dismiss (and then verify that I really wanted to MISS OUT on). Since this is an app I'm using to try to get (out of characters for review, but it's dumb)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 9+ years of using the app, it officially won't let me make new notes without purchasing a plan. I spent the last couple years dealing with them spamming premium plan ads and making it difficult to even open notes. You'd think with 100 million downloads, they'd have enough premium accounts to not lock me out of my basic account. Just kept using the app because I had years of notes that I go through pretty often. Oh well. Guess I'll just use google docs, until that charges too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free versione is getting useless day after day. I'll be leaving it soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Time to move on from Evernote!!!. Free plan is useless, Paid plans is too expensive!!! Alternatives? Joplin, Obsidian, Onenote and others."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over priced! Not worth paying for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just wanted a simple app to make notes and tag them. I've stuck with the app over the years despite the ""are you sure you don't want to upgrade? You'll never get this AMAZING offer again"" every single time I open the app. I'm not going to pay the same price I pay for my Adobe subscription for a note taking app. I would gladly have paid $15 once for it but $130 a year is ridiculous, especially when there are better and cheaper options out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They keep popping ads and removing features to try to force an overpriced subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ruined a great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"He usado evernote desde sus inicios y me parecía una aplicación excepcional, pero esta nueva opción de 50 notas no me permite hacer nada, pensé en suscribirme a premium pero 15 dolares al mes es un precio totalmente absurdo, incluso comparándolo con los servicios de streamings, agradezco a evernote todos estos años pero cambiaré de aplicacion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constantly being hacked. Receiving emails of accounts being accessed from all over the world. Password change after password change. Limit of 50 notes and would buldge even when I deleted some apps. Offers some ""you will not see it again discounts"" everytime when I open the app. Yes, it's commercially driven, but if it's like this and I would not pay for a note taking app, goodbye. My old review: Keeps your notes in the cloud. Accessible everywhere. Great app. Best in its class. Desire HD"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now my hundreds of notes are captive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not recommend. The app has limited the amount of notes to 50 on the free version (without any notice beforehand as far as I could see), which now makes it practically useless. I've used this app for nearly 10 years, so this is really unfortunate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another long time user moving to a new app also. Says I have reached max amount of notes and must pay a subscription to add new notes. Even after I deleted over 10 outdated notes I could not add any new ones without paying. I'll switch to a new app before I pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Daily requests to upgrade from free plan to plan that costs the same as a netflix subscription. The product is mediocre, and the customer service/recent policy changes are despicable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app sucks. But so does the website. I create a list with check boxes on the website, and when I use it in the app, it turns the check boxes into bullet points... so frustrating. It also tends to put spaces where none existed before. It's a train wreck. I hate that I ever started using Evernote because all my notes are in there, and it's a huge pain to migrate them. And now Evernote has limited the free version to 50 notes and 1 notebook to try and force users to pay. FN POS!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to like Evernote, but the constant nagging me to upgrade has gotten unbearable. I'll move to OneDrive. Update: the last pricing changes made it absolutely useless! 1 notebook and 50 notes? Are you kidding me?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has gone rogue. The limits are ridiculous. After more than a decade of being loyal to Evernote, it's now time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"**update 21st Dec 2023, had enough of unbearable adds and moved notes to Google keep and closed account. ** Intrusive adds are out of control, I just want a basic place to save a few notes but every time I open the app lately I get very difficult to close advertising and offers for premium. It's motivating me to close my account and move to add free Google keep never mind subscribe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They now limit you with one notebook and 50 notes. Not accepting their constant pleas of upgrading to a plan I didn't need wasn't good enough for them. How dare I only use this app on two devices, how dare I not want to pay to use basic features they lock behind a paywall. That isn't good for their bottom line. So now we have to pay to use the app in a functional way, but only on mobile since they know its about ease of access. I am tired of these companies with their ""rent forever"" philosophy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good, $$ gouging"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've never seen an application that has been transformed so much driven by greed. It was so good and didn't mind paying until it became so slow to load followed by aggressive push to pay for subscription. Even the free version is not worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How's this update working out for you Evernote? 😂 I've also been a user for over 10 years and likewise I won't be pandering to your greed. £70 odd for a basic note app is daylight robbery especially when you'll be making money out of advertising as well. Will be deleting as soon as possible and good riddance - maybe listen to your consumers in the future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The greedy devs were asking for horns, but lost their ears 🐮"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to say goodbye Evernote I have used this since 2018. Evernote was a great notebook, but the subscription fee is getting higher day by day. Subscription fee is can't bear to people who live in 3rd world developing countries. The truth is life is getting harder and even I don't have money to satisfy my basic needs. Now I can't create unlimited notes in free version.I am going to stop using Evernote and moving to One Note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm with all the others who feel frustrated to use a free app and now being forced to pay... It's only a note app... If they need money why not have advertising?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a 5/5 review from 2012 and its 1/5 review update from Dec 2023. 50 free notes only, really? Literally each launch is bombarded with plan upgrade ads. I wish these genius managers a pleasant flight, but I'm out. Cheers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years and now you start charging fees. Not impressed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved using the app for the last 10 years and even recommended to family and friends. But now we will all start removing the app once our created notebooks are moved elsewhere. We are no longer able to create new notebooks past 50. Additionally, the cost is crazy high... Hate having to leave, but they are forcing the issue with their new policy. Bad move Evernote! 🥴"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't download. Everything behind a pay wall now. Just use a free notes app. They should have incorporated advertising instead of charging."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Closed my account 12/19 they ran my card 12/20 $139 for a new billing cycle. Used to be simple and more reliable. Now it's neither. Fighting to get money back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I never write reviews for apps, but making an exception. Evernote, now, is utter garbage. I've been a user for at least 10 years and the new nickel-and-diming has made looking for an alternative an no-brainer. But oh no, you can't migrate your info until you disconnect a synced device. And oh no, you can't unsync devices more than twice per month. So you can't do anything till the new month rolls around or pay a hefty price. I'm shocked that they're not charging me for using my laptop. Garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good Apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This new 50 notes one notebook rule is ridiculous. As a user from 2012, this means it it time to move on. Maybe before monetization, the customers will have a voice."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New subscription model is absurd. Now if you use it for free you get 1 notebook and only 50 notes. Before this, I had 10+ notebooks and well over 500 notes. I've been using this for freelance writing, as well as D&D and tabletop prep. This had been my go to for quite a few years. Once I would heavily reccomend Evernote, certainly not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can not draw on pictures. Ever since 2022 I couldn't even download properly on my app. Ask for assistance, never a God response. It's like waste of my money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Smooth operation, integrated data platform across all your devices - this was my feedbsck until December 2023. With more than 150 notes suddenly I was told I wont be able to creat new notes unless paying USD $100+ per yesr. A consumption based model will be much easier to be accepted"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Following the rest of the mass exodus, I too take my leave and head to other platforms. Evernote's new subscription plan confirmed my fear - the ship's going down, and since I'm not the captain, I'll abandon ship before it sinks completely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Money grab. Every time I open the app they are trying to guilt trip me into getting their monthly subscription. When you press 'no' another pop up comes up saying 'ARE YOU SURE?' I'm trying to export my info to Samsung notes NOW. UPDATE: Just received an email now they're trying to force people to get their Evernote Personal subscription for $15/month by limiting Evernote Free to 50 notes and 1 notebook. Absolutely crazy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please don't get scammed by this app. IT IS NOT FREE. It has been useful but unless you're willing to pay almost £80 a year for it then it stops working without warning, if you can afford it then it's great, I can't afford it so I find the sneaky way of having you invest hundreds of hours creating reminders and notes without openly saying that you will have to pay is very underhand. I pay for many apps on a voluntary basis but this one is way too expensive for the basic user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for over 10 years and it was always really helpful. I have so many notebooks with so much information saved. But when I opened it today to make a new note and I saw that they want me to pay $130 a year to add anything else, I will be switching to a different app. That is a horribly outrageous price for an app that isn't even that good. I would rather have random ads, or have to watch a few ads each time I opened it. So I will be finding another app as will many other people"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Strong dislike to new 50 notes limit. Notes were literally the only thing I was using this app for. Disappointed and moving to another app. Also the app became so slow and glitchy..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A limit of 50 for the free version. Are you serious? Talk about discouraging the use of your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after years of being a great and reliable app, the business has changed and is now restricted to a pay only plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent changes have forced me to remove this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To see the app go down the drain by chipping away at its features and putting them behind a paywall is disappointing, to say at the very least. I used this app in conjunction with a writing app to keep things neat for almost a decade, and had hundreds of documents on Evernote. Opening the app to see now I can only have 50 maximum was the last straw. I could deal with the constant pop ups for upgrades, I could deal with fewer options, but not this. I'm looking for a better alternative now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have so many problems with syncing and they just doubled the price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant pop-ups taking over the screen begging for users to subscribe. Now they finally are forcing users to pay by limiting notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Says I can't continue making note with the free version. Ever though I'm allowed 50 and only have 22. Been using this for years to jot stuff down. Now they BEGGING for money and it's ridiculous for this to even have a subscription model."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy app and subscription too expensive for casual user. EverNote used to be a great app when I started in 2012. Since then it got progressively worse. Lately it randomly scrolls or overwrites text. Recently they implemented 50 note max for free accounts. I closed my account. Sorry EverNote. Good luck!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This company has been in a downward spiral for years and they finally locked my account unless I upgrade now. Just spent hours copying my notes out of it to Joplin (exporting is disabled too on my account now). Multiple notes 'couldnt be loaded' during the process. This used to be a solid solution but the daily spamming of upgrade popups in the app and losing of my data when using their failed encryption option has finally pushed me away for good. Poor product making a huge money grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"11 years with this App. Guess is time for a change. $129.99?? I don't think so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app, with the new restrictions & high subscription charge I will have to find a new app fory notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ripped off!! Upgraded & wanted to pay monthly, they took whole amount. Immediately canceled. STILL TOOK MY MONEY!!!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE CON ARTISTS!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has become virtually unusable after the last update, and the paid version is an outlandishly overpriced subscription. Unlike media-streaming apps that allow me to access entertainment, Evernote is asking for $11/month to access my own notes. After 9 years I would have happily paid a one-time fee, but there's no aspect of this app that lends itself to a subscription model. Shame, it deserved 5 stars before this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good for everyday use but demands upgrade .. !!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2011. In 2012 I gave them a 5 star review, but like many legacy users I found out we don't matter. All my notebooks deleted, I can't make any new notes without giving them over $100/year? It's lost it's functionality, I can spend $0 for apps that do what I did before on Evernote or $60 for all of Microsoft office (including better note taking) with 1tb of cloud storage. Nevernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was pretty good until they got super pushy with their sales and pop-ups became obsessive. Now, you have a maximum number of notes you can create on the free version. And it's total notes ever created, so you can't delete old ones and keep it for free. I'm now pushed out of the app totally and have to switch back to the Google Notes app. Shame on the developers for their money grab!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of accumulating notes and lyrics on this app I am being forced into paying a premium to continue to use it. Horrible business ethics. Guess it's time to find a way to migrate to another note taking app that doesn't try to forcefully take your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I solely used this app for about 5 years and it was fantastic. Over the past few years they started to add features and 'upgrade' which started the downward spiral. Things became glitchy and quickly became annoying AF to use. Now they want $6 bucks a week in order to have more than 50 notes. If it worked as it did I would pay but no chance I'm spending money on this. Now I'm pissed because I can't figure a way to retrieve my years of notes. Wish they kept it simple"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's a good enough app, I would consider a subscription, if their greed vendors didn't try to trap me inside their paywall, by progressively restricting their free functionality up to a joke like 1 notebook and 50 notes, all without any notice, without giving any time to considering paying or alternatives. After years, it's blackmailing behaviour, they don't realise how many alternatives exist, in fact I've just migrated, and they deserve to go bankrupt."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2023 update: finally done with this garbage, switching to Keep. UPDATE 6 YEARS LATER: Somehow, with each update and ""exciting new and improved version"", they manage to screw it up worse and worse. After this new one, my notes won't even open. ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Review from 2015: Overall an extraordinary app, BUT, every once and a while it will crash and lose the document I've been working on. It's supposed to auto save, but today I lost over 20 minutes of solid work, which was disheartening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely Horrible Now. Ridiculous amounts of subscription requests EVERY TIME YOU START WRITING A NOTE. Had subscription, not worth it, overpriced. Cant customize anything and the note space is limited due to the size of the toolbars and note lists, plus, its all very generic. Very limited capabilities and I am not a negative reviewer, but the requests for a subscription happening every time I begin to write a thought is so irritating. I've lost multiple trains of thought at this point"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of using Evernote I kicked this APP because they very often asked me for upgrade of about 50 pounds per year to use it NORMAL way. Are they offer antivirus App or a computer drivers App or something that needs daily, weekly or monthly update? Unreasonable price and every year... I kicked Evernote out of my phone. It was difficult to save every note using copy-paste of the phone but finally I am free from this Evernote. I definitely wouldn't recommend it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hate the fact that I cant create new notes.. Been using it since a long time ago, now will move to other notes app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote free since 2019, but will stop now. The new subscription model is wildly overpriced for private users, and exporting your notes is an unbelievable pain especially if you have more than a couple of notebooks. In addition, you can't export whole stacks, only notebooks, and that only from a desktop version. -_- I have moved to UpNote and would recommend doing this, as UpNote is quite a lot more userfriendly, both in pricing and in usability."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely trash now! Less than 1 star! Used to be the best note taking app available. Now they are taking away previously free options unless you pay. I don't appreciate bate and switch. If Evernote keeps this up their are plenty of other note taking apps available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You get constantly spammed with adverts to upgrade and they're clearly doing it to annoy you into upgrading. Uninstalling after years of use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch go elswhere.. This used to be free Now you are limited to 50 notes and one album? I have used this app for 10 years and now I can't get to my albums and have to delete them! I had to delete my older Monthly bank registers I am copying the rest of my notes to another program."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The barrage of upgrade popups are super annoying - looking at other solutions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to love the free app....new prices are absolutely insane 🙄 very disappointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had enough of your incessantly annoying home screen popups.  Now a limit on the number of notes. I deleted few notes and also cleared trash and still getting the same message. That's the last straw, now I'm done with Evernote. Notion or Joplin is where it's at."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This new 50 note limit isn't going generate the revenue for your app you think it will. Most people already have well over 50 notes in the app and forcing them to an overpriced subscription is just an opportunity for another app. I'm in the process of migrating my notes, I suggest others do the same."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"never reminds anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this app for nearly 10 yrs, if I could I would give this app a ""zero"" rating now as one star is still too much since the last upgrade. While using the free version, tolerated the lag, the error of notes duplicating, syncing issues, slow loading a note (had to exit app and reload note) & am now being told I have reached my notes limited (now the limit is 50 on free version). Being asked the exorbitant price of $159.99+/yr is cray cray. Evernote has forced it's hand...I say bye bye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sudden change in your plan?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really??? You are forcing free users to cave in to premium just to add more notes and notebooks. I've been doing Evernote since 2013, I'm very disappointed in you, Evernote. You made us reconsider about moving onto next notemaking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They nerfed the only good multiplatform note app. New note limit has now got me looking for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now you can't have even more than 1 notebook and 50 notes smh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ok, wow. So, changing my review quickly. I've been using Evernote since 2016 and woke up one day to see, like everyone else, that they've implemented a subscription system with a 50 note 1 notebook limit...I have hundreds of notes and multiple notebooks. Cutting my notes in half won't get me even close to 50. $130/yr or $15/month? For a notes app? Are you crazy? Yea, gonna have to transfer over to an app run by people who aren't gonna nosedive it into the ground for absolutely no reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has some good and useful features for keeping, organising and syncing notes between devices and online. Unfortunately it is sometime extremely SLOW to operate or launch. It often takes a few minutes before I am able to open and write any note, which defeats the purpose of being able to take a quick-notes on the go. And when this happens, it can be very frustrating..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless now. It was a good program. But these new features limiting us to 50 notes has made it unusable. I don't have the kind of money they are trying to force us to spend. I'll find something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their pricing has become increasingly ridiculous. They want to charge 30% more for a notes app than Google charges for 2TB of storage! Absolutely not worth it anymore. I've been a user for over 15 years and am finally deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the heck?! I've used this app for years and all of a sudden without notice, get a pop up that says I'm limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes?! That is just not good customer service. No warning. And the cost is $130 a year - that's a huge jump from $0!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. now that it only allows 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great app, but now that they're reducing the free version to 1 notebook and 50 notes it's time to abandon this one. Anti-consumerism is ugly no matter where it lives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was a good thing, it is called ""Evernote"" and they reduced notes to 50 notes with multiple notebooks. Before it was endless now 1 notebook only for $129 a year. Notebooks are $1 at Walmart"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after years of use for free. I couldn't handle the ads for premium, at a laughable cost, any longer. Google Keep will work just fine for what I need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Longtime (since 2013) user here. Recent updates have completely changed the UI and made this previously great note a clunky mess; constant animations, needing to restart, keyboard issues... All around worse. And now, I can't add notes without paying this trash developer $130/year? Hilarious. OneNote is where I'll be transferring all my notes as I leave this POS app behind."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for nearly 4 years. I'm a writer, I have so much stored on this app. I can't do anything with a 50 note limit, let alone a single notebook. I have nearly 100 notebooks and over 600 notes. This is ridiculous, and I will be leaving this app in the dirt for something else. They have no one to blame but themselves."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"what a retarded decision to modify the free plan. do you not understand your users?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like most reviewers, I really loved this app until recently. All the latest updates have been terrible. The app is slow and buggy now, I'm CONSTANTLY being pushed to upgrade my plan, and now I can't make any new notes without an upgrade. Again, like a lot of people, I'd be happy enough to pay a once off fee, but a subscription?? For a notes app??? The developers have truly lost their damn minds. I'm disgusted with what this app has become, and I won't be using it anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app happily for many years and have over 300 notes saved. I am both angry and disgusted that the developers have suddenly decided to charge $129 per year for this previously free service. I will not be paying the fee and will instead be looking for a free or at least reasonably-priced note-taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Done using this app. They must be insane to think I'd pay $12+/mo for a just satisfactory app to keep notes on. Maybe $20 a year for the storage space but there's nothing about it worth $130 per year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 5 stars, now 1. Having used the free version for over 10 years to create and store approx 350 small notes and memos I now find that I'm limited to 50 notes unless I want to pay a subscription. I assume someone woke up one morning and thought, 'I wonder what's the best way to piss off millions of customers.... I know, let's suddenly charge them after 10 years.....' No thanks, I'll find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not happy with changes to app over the years. initially it was great. now expected having to pay for disappointing app. will not be using evernote anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep asking for money! But I lost 90% of notes as unreadable! I am NOT going to pay for that to happen again!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly limiting to one notebook and 50 notes to make more money, instead of adding value-- bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used Evernote for years, but after downgrading to a free account it's just not worth it. Nearly every action in the app triggers a ""one time only offer!"" to upgrade to a paid account, and requiring multiple interactions to dismiss. The fully paid app is fine but pricier than it needs to be, and the free version is frustrating enough that I'll just move everything to another service and delete the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly and respectfully: Screw Evernote. Changing the interface every so often, fine I can deal but they installed a 50 notes limit to armstrong you into buying their yearly membership which, in my opinion, way to expensive. I am transfering my notes to another application, and to everyone who reads this, I strongly do NOT recommend Evernote. Stay away and sace yourself the trouble. The experience gets worse as time goes on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for many, many years. However, from one day to the next the number of notes has now been restricted to 50 and I am now unable to create new notes unless I upgrade. Shame to leave after all the years, but there are enough free apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting notes has caused me to transfer all of my data so I can move to a different free service that doesn't berate me with ""special deals"" constantly. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great, but just getting progressively worse. Even with the constant ads to upgrade, it was usable. Now it's completely useless as I can only have 50 notes. After using for years, I have over 300 notes, but will now switch to something else as I can't use it without paying. For now, it's an archive of past notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry your charging way to much for what it is and what it's used for...lower your price and maybe.. otherwise..your going to lose a lot of people in the economy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT USE!!! I have been using the free version of this app for years, and would be happy to pay a nominal amount, but without my authorisation they have just charged me £79.99. I can't find a way to cancel the subscription and get a refund. I'm furious."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Old version is good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had to pay the subscription fee due to a bug that leads the app to think you have more than 2 devices active. The only way to access my data was via the pay wall. I don't recommend. Update 2023: every time you use the app there is an offer to upgrade to premium. Annoying! I plan to move to onenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EN has locked me out of all of my docs wanting me to upgrade to a paid service. Have used EN since 2010 now this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote for almost a decade and recommend it to customers back when I used to sell cell phones. Now it's plagued with ads and limitations. It's time to move on, and find a better app for taking notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There are far better note apps out there. This is one of the worst, glitchy, limited functions, it's just a moneygrab app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't create new notes do to new policy limit. DELETING!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"These guys are absolutely crazy if they think people should or even will pay $130 a year just to create digital notes and check lists on their phone.. Google and 100 other apps have that for free.. goodbye Evernote, it's been fun"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once really great˳ now it's so sadly bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has revoked access to my notes and won't let me create a new one unless I pay them. I've been with Evernote for five years, and it was good while it lasted, but it looks like I'll have to switch to a different note taking app from now on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It WAS a great app. Now it's practically unusable for free users. With the new update, free user version support 1 notebook and 50 notes. I'm an old user and I had multiple notebooks. I thought I could move all my notes to one notebook and delete unnecessary ones - NOW I CAN'T EVEN DO THAT! All I can do now is read existing notes. Since I don't make notes regularly, the premium subscription is too much for me. Looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uso esta aplicação há mais de 10 anos. Era tão boa e tornou-se tão má, ao ponto de pela primeira vez equacionar seriamente mudar de aplicação. Seja por ter deixado de ser user friendly, seja por estarmos constantemente a ser bombardeados por marketing para aderimos aos pacotes pagos. Enfim, estão a deitar tudo a perder. Less is more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user since 2011 and feel absolutely betrayed by the revocation of an actual free plan. Its completely unusable now and I'm not paying $120 a year for a notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be convenient because it backs-up data automatically, but now they are aggressively pushing their ads and you are limted to one notebook and 50 notes. The paid service is a subscription too, not a one-time fee, and it's not cheap. Moreover, even though the app seems to get updated regularly, the app doesn't improve much. The updates only really shift the UI around."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whatapieceofcrap! It keeps telling me that I have too many devices connected (only 2 are allowed]). But I DO NOT have it installed anywhere except for my phone and my computer. When I use the app to try to ""disconnect a device"" it gives me a window with links that are dead. I tried to upgrade but got nothing but more dead links. Do not waste your time with this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disabled any free version of the app with no warning to users. The cheapest paid version is 130 a year (and continuing to climb)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was awesome. I absolutely loved it. Now though....it's a complete wreck 💔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used the app for 10 years. For shopping list and things I want to remember and similar. Used it for notes, basically. Now, with a limit of 50 notes, I deleted some 30-40 old notes coming down to around 20 notes. Could I make a new note? No. It would seem that the 50 notes limit is in total ever made. Deleting does nothing. I could have accepted 50 max. I'm not paying more for this than for full ms office suite. No way. Stupid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"L for Evernote after new regulations about free user. Not recommended 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Go download the free note app from atomczak. Way better, does everything that evernote pro does. For free. Evernote can bite my salami"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to use this app all the time but after the take over, they made the free version completely unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is BS! Now I can only have 50 notes...time to move on!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"as long as I use this application, for me it is very useful and very good, after updating the application, I can't move notes, always ask to buy a package"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've switched to OneNote. Evernote used to be great but is now very slow and basic features regularly fail (Even creating new text notes or sharing webpages to it). The subscription price (now being forced upon users) would be ridiculously expensive even if the app worked, so I've no idea who they expect to cough up that amount of money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How the mighty fall! What used to be the go to app is today a pale shadow of itself. Says 50 notes in a notebook is allowed but doesn't let me add a new note which is well within the limit of 50. Shameless premium promotion on every tap. Can't even perform basic functions like selection of note content smoothly. UI is a drag. Better avoid it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You basically killed off the free version. Otherwise pretty expensive. Farewell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is so ridiculous and I'm sorry for this change of plan! I am one of your old users and I am not satisfied at all with this plan change. Because: ""Evernote Free accounts now have fifty notes and one notebook Starting on December 4, Free users have a maximum of fifty notes and one notebook per account. If you're currently at (or above) this new limit, you can still view, edit, export, share, and delete your existing notes and notebooks—you just can't create new ones."""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"JUST 50 NOTES AND JUST ONE NOTEBOOK OUT OF THE BLUE? THAT'S JUST CRUELTY. It's been a fun ride Evernote. Paying would have been cool if it were affordable but I even hear that is laden with ads. Really sad. Thank you for the fun times, which ended long ago"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow this app has definitely been proof of Cory Doctorow's concept of enshittification - started becoming ropey a while back, now totally unusable. Can recommend Joplin as an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Alot of lost potential, i'm absolutely disappointed that they pushed for making people pay $130 a year to have unlimited stuff, while the free plan only lets you have 1 notebook and 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous monetization. Any time I try to do anything I get a pop-up about some special deal to pay $100 instead of some higher number to continue using the app. Used to be free a great, free app, but it's utterly unusable now. Use anything else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for 8 years, and am now going to have to look for a new service due to their greedy monetization. You can no longer have more than 50 notes or more than a SINGLE notebook without paying - I get server costs can get expensive, and limiting users somewhat makes sense, but a limit of 50 notes is a joke that makes the service impossible to use now, especially with how prohibitively expensive their paid plans are. $15 a month is INSANE. It's corporate greed, plain and simple."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sick of requests to update and now the note limit of 50 has been applied, which I am already over - I'm off!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes and 1 notebook is a joke. Just use Google Keep notes and have virtually all of the same functionality without the all but forcing a premium price tag down your throat. There has to be a better way of trying to stay afloat than this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent update is a disaster. Evernote was what I used to tell everyone how a real long vision startup it. 100 yr vision has been pushed out it seems. So sad that I have to move out of evernote after like 10 yrs of use. My whole notes size would barely be 50 MB. As a dev i understand that costs nothing. Find new chargable features guys than limiting to X notes. Even X notes a month was bearable. Revert these updates 🙏 You are forcing ppl to switch. BAD MOVE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately, like the other posters, I am unhappy with the constant pop ups to upgrade, and the now very restrictive free version Had the pro version for a year, and it worked well, but don't need all the features now, and the free version is no longer fun. Have been using it for 13 years, but time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm glad to find that what I came to the reviews to say is already being said. This was my go-to place for keeping my assorted random creative ideas, lyrics, poems, some journaling. I liked having a special app for that. Suddenly limiting that to 50 notes is pretty heartbreaking. I get that apps cost money to make and maintain but this is not the way to treat the people who use your software."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's so sad I can't even open my old notes to transfer them to Microsoft and cloud them there!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Had this app for ages but they've gotten extremely slimy in the last year constantly bombarding you with ads to upgrade and now there's a limit on notes and notebooks. Two stars just because the interface itself is great but the upgrade price is incredibly unreasonable. At least have paid tiers with less features that are affordable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many others are saying, this app WAS a great note taking app. However over the past year Evernote has gotten much more predatory with their in-app self advertisement. Updated review: 1 star now, I've been an Evernote user for 13 years and they decide to restrict me to 50 notes. Or an insane yearly subscription. It's time to leave Evernote for good. Tip to the marketing managers: never, ever, take away free features and sell them as paid features. Especially without grandfathering."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"money grabbers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best digital Notebook I've ever seen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note restriction? Lol. Later"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote SUCKS NOW! They severely limit you as punishment for not paying! I've been using Evernote for years and never had to upgrade. They have added so many features that I just don't care about using, I only need Notebooks, Stacks, and notes. But now I can't create anymore notes, notebooks, or stacks unless I pay $130 a year. I'm keeping all of the stuff I created prior to them robbing us but not upgrading. Aren't there more people buying Premium? Why cripple free users like they're doing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years without any issues, now I'm forced to pay a subscription if I want make any new notes, even though I'm way under my limit of 50 saved notes. Hope devs see they royally screwed thier userbase with this latest change to the app. All they see is $$$."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good, now it's trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's messed up again. Twice now I've found my notes missing large sections, with no way to undo the changes without buying a subscription and using the history feature. Update: Happened again. Sometimes the app won't load a note and I have to close and reopen it. The subscription nag screens are excessive. And now they're limiting free accounts to 50 notes?! What a horribly mismanaged company and product. Why would I want to pay an exhorbitant price for something that doesn't work?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not happy with Evernote. To many money making changes. I removed/CANCELED right after last update. Today it was back on my phone as a paid upgrade. NOT TRUE.... I cancelled. I am so p .... off with them. Now I have to go back to my venders and tell them not to accept. Isn't this against the law...To charge after cancellation $139.58... I am sending a letter to the Better Business Bureau and the Attorney General to look into what Evernote is doing and how they are suddenly charging all of us who"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I understand Evernote wants to have more paid customers, but everyday offerings are quite inconvenient. Please just stop it or do it once a month. I'm thinking about using alternative online notes, honestly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've loved and used Evernote for over a decade, but recently it has really gone downhill. The interface on both the app and desktop version have gotten increasingly more and more clunky to use. I decided to downgrade and stop paying for it, and now I get constant popups asking me to upgrade. Additionally, it errors out trying to access PDF attachments in notes. I'd be happy to pay for this app if they'd stop making it worse and worse, but it looks like I need to start looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"had a password seed key picture saved. now it is not opening. ""error"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolute sods - for more than 10 years Evernote charged based on storage space rather than amount of notes saved, the perfect option for someone who saves + writes a lot of text and I would rave about Evernote to anyone who listened - now I am paywalled out of thousands of notes because of these arbitrary new cash-grabbing limits. I will figure out how to export everything despite the paywall and so will most others I'm sure 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changed my rating from five star to one. It is sad to see such a good app going downhill in a few years time. The new limit for free plan is a scandal. Who would pay such a high fee for a note taking app when there are so many free ones available on the market?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I still love the app but I'm moving to an alternative due to the price increase to $129.99 per year. I'm a light user and can't justify the cost, and the free option doesn't offer enough notebooks any more to meet my needs. Dropping from 5 to 3 stars due to the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great but they got greedy. Way to ruin something good! Great job!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New 50 note and 1 notebook limit is absolute garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been with evernote for more years than I can count. But recently they changed to only allow 50 notes for free total. What a shame that they weren't happy with us having to look at their ads in exchange for the service. And now they're charging exorbitant fees. I will be looking for another app or use Google Drive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slow to create note. Takes too long to start up and too many options to get to write a quick note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It now costs if you want more than 50 notes, I'm moving to another app👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overwriting a glowing 5-star review I left several years ago to say that I am no longer using this app. It used to be a great, user-friendly, and just plain useful digital notebook. On top of now-constant disruptive pop-ups advertising their premium plans, today I opened up the app to discover that I can't even make new notes anymore. The free version is now limited to 1 notebook with a 50 note maximum. Really disappointed, and will be uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the free version since 2015 and while there have been a fair amount of bugs, the new fee-model is outrageous. $159.99/year? $17.99/month? For what? The services Evernote provides do not come close to the quality that demands that kind of subscription. Furthermore, the free services states you can have up to 50 notes. I have less than than 50 but because I won't subscribe it says I can't create a new note. Deplorable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly bombarded by ads for the premium plans and offers that it pushes onto you. They're so exclusive (I'm told if I exit them I'll never see them again!) that I get them more or less every time I use the app. To make matters worse, it now tells me I've hit the free limit of 50 despite only having 23 notes. I can't even use the app anymore... In other words, I'll be looking for a better notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they suddenly limited the amount of notes you can make for free after I've used the app for years now. I had to delete over 20 notes to make new ones because additional ones are now behind a pay wall. unacceptable change. very disappointed and going to find a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"CONSTANT requests to upgrade to pro. It's baffling that they think that interrupting me constantly will prompt to upgrade when all it does is make me want to find an alternative app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is getting worse every year, as the limits are tightened. I've been using the app and recommending it for years but I just realized that free subscription suddenly got not that comfortable as it was. The app shows paid offers twice every time it is started and prices are really high. There are many alternatives for the better price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using for a long time and paid at various times but I'm not paying $120 a year so I can have 51 notes docs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was great until recently when they decided to charge $129.99 a year in order to have over 50 notes. Mind you, I already had 362 notes. Ridiculous!!! They should, at least, have grandfathered current notes. If I was able to give zero stars, I would. I used to recommend Evernote to all my family and friends. Not only am I no longer recommending this app, I'll be uninstatlling as soon as I transfer all my notes to another app. ZERO STARS!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now unusable. I've been using this for over 10 years and the constant requests to upgrade were getting ridiculous. Now it's unusable because of the 50 note limit without paying. I have so many notes and notebooks before this update so I now can't make anymore is just stupid."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Typical company greed wanting more and more money ruined what was a very good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly, without notice, do not allow any more inputs... this is unacceptable behavior. Why didn't you ADVISE from beginning, like other apps do? And you expect angry users to be your paying customers? Good luck!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"5 stars to 1 star. I have paid for plus app for a couple of years, but then switched over to free app. I have been a loyal evernote user for like 12 years. 50 note limit? Personal plans start at $130 per year? I can get the entire office 365 suite for 70 per year. Good bye forever! I hope you all get fired."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for over a decade. Now I'm unable to even make a new note without paying £80 a year....ridiculous. Will be moving everything other to another app. Such a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the app for YEARS and have over 300 notes and suddenly, the free version limits you to only 50 notes, as well as limiting the number of devices you can have the account on (it used to be 3 from what I remember, then 2, now 1). Do not bother with this app unless you have AU$159.99 (yearly, 17.99 monthly) to fork over to make it actually useful. What's more, the notes take AGES to open up, and sometimes, it just outright refuses to open. Now I gotta look for a new notes app T^T"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have the most invasive ways to try and make you upgrade to premium... And now free users only get 50 notes and one single notebook. Been using this app since 2015 and now I feel I've been taking hostage by their app.. who would seriously pay 160$ a year for a notebook app. It's simply not worth it. Not to mention synch problems all the time between users.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a good run. 50 notes is kinda lame and the price is kinda crazy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous subscription plan! I have 450 notes on my 10 year old free plan account. Evernote switched to a 50-note free plan account. I'm not going to delete 400+ notes. They didn't even give us an sufficient notice. The overpriced subscriptions exclude single digit pricing plans. For people with disabilities that I advocate for, this is disappointing. My advice is to go buy a Supernote (or reMarkable), with ""free"" notes, and free cloud connection, and move on from this legacy business. Crazy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very annoying constant popups with fake info trying to push you to pay an entirely unreasonable amount per year for premium subscription. I have less than 50 notes now, which is the free use limit, have the trash bin emptied as well, but I cannot make a new friggin note, the app keeps blocking me with another damn popup about limit reached and push to subscribe to premium. I used to love this app, but these false and possibly fraudulent pushy tactics have destroyed it all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit and way to expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i have been an evernote user for more than a decade and when they decided to limit amount of notes without upgrading i thought ""no big deal, i never have more than a dozen or so at any given time"". the problem becomes when there are 33 empty notes in my trash that WILL NOT delete. all evernote says is upgrade. well no upgrade for me and no evernote on my phone or desktop anymore either. truly disappointed in this product's schemes to try to gouge their loyal customers. loyal no more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once a great app, not a total flop. It's forcing you to subscribe if you want to have over 50 notes. It'a asking for 99€/year, for a note taking app!! Outrageous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Congratulations! By implementing the 50 notes limit you just made me look for another notes app. I already migrated all my notes there and I don't miss at all the aggressive 'one time offers' and the long loading times of Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm an OG Evernote user, occasionally paying for it when I needed more storage. For months I've been irritated by the absolutely nonstop, obnoxious harassment to upgrade. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Finally the app is not usable unless you pay $130 a year. Absolutely not. I'll be moving my thousands of notes to another platform. Your service is NOT worth the same cost as Spotify, Netflix, Dropbox, etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 50 note for free plan!!! Very Bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to enjoy using this app because of how much organisation it promoted. Each notebook could have their theme and i could organise the ideas. But now, the whole 1 notebook with 50 notes is ridiculous. Even the free version had glitches and serious bugs. Sometimes it would delete as I was typing. Now they are requesting a ridiculous amount. Not a fan anymore. Hopefully, they review this update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Probably gonna change app soon , with all it's limits now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's aggressive restrictions on the free tier with no middle ground pricing except their very expensive options means i will be changing provider afyer many years of Evernote. I have eveb previously suggested a low usage tier but Evernote did not seem interested un that which is a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moving to another note app. Used this for years but as others have stated it's not worth paying loads for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and I love it. Recently I have needed to tighten my budget so I have gone to the free version. I have been paying for this app for years because it is helpful. Now as I can't afford it the app is essentially useless. You can only create 50 notes and 1 notebook in the free version. I'm really disappointed and I will just take my notes to Google docs or some other free service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the first ever Note app I'm using for 10 years. Now, all of a sudden, it has stopped making new notes because I haven't bought a plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2016 and have always been very fond of it. However they've recently changed the free plan to make it entierly unviable. 1 notebook and 50 notes cap isn't functional for an app designed around notes and the 14 a month sub for a basic account is unreasonable. The constant pop up ads for the ""limited time"" deals for premium were additionally extremely shady and poor conduct. I will be browsing for a new app moving forward."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It ised to be a good app, but this recent update is terrible on mobile"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I started using Evernote in 2017 and it was a great app at the time. More features then I ever knew what to do with that helped me organize my ideas for everything from groceries to my art. However it's now a barely usable mess with bad UI that takes more and more features away so you'll pay for it. But don't worry! The constant intrusive ads for premium will offer you amazing discounts! Go find another app. This one's hot garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to recommend this to people but I never will again. Every single time I go to take a note, I bombarded by premium ads. And If I want to take another note I have to pay 130$!? What a joke. Save yourself the time and go to literally any other free note taking app. I'll be transferring all my stuff and doing away with this one. This one has reached its end."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Grab the free version if you have piles of cash to burn! Used the free version for years. Don't need bells and whistles etc! Now, if I want to add a note, I could do it for about $150! LMAO! BITEME! EVERNOTE! I WILL UNINSTALL ASAP..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aplikasi BUSUK yang overprice. Sedang proses pindah data ke note-taking lain yg free dan no lag. Setelah itu, UNINSTALL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 5 stars but the share feedback button doesn't work. The developers need to allow us to have custom color or image backgrounds per note or per notebook. Allow color coding of notebooks in sidebar. I will cancel my yearly subscription until you add these simple things"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"That paywall is wild for an app that's not even that great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deleting this app after their insane price hike. Goodbye buddy ! It was a 10+ years bonding.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye Evernote! You think you're going to bully me into a plan when I have so many other completely free options!? Hahahaha!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be my go to notes app and so I stuck by it even after the UI became a nightmare and it became increasingly difficult to edit and save notes. I stuck by it even when the premium pop ups became increasingly annoying. However, this limit of 50 notes and just one notebook for free users has become the proverbial straw that broke this camel's back. Will switch to keeping a journal and writing with a pen from now on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 50 notes and 1 notebook for free with the last update, good luck if you had more than that before. Breathtakingly greedy. Capitalism in its ultimate phase, self consumption."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version now restricts you to 50 notes and 1 notebook. As someone who has 300+ notes and several notebooks, this app is now useless unless I start spending money. Not to mention that it's been getting buggier for years now. I'm looking elsewhere for a notes app I can rely on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 notes and 1 notebook in free plan. currently I have 9 notes and I can't create new one. This app is more and more limited from one year to another"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update has completely ruined this app. I, like many other users have used this for years and the new update has destroyed the formatting on so many of my notes it's mind boggling. As someone else said, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The old version was so much better. There appear to be hundreds of similar negative reviews since this update, and I don't see any replies or anyone from the company addressing it. I didn't think it could get any worse. I'll be looking for something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So you decided to ditch me with your 1 notebook & 50 notes limit. Me with 59 notebooks and 647 notes in main one. At least give me an offer that does not say NaN for a price. Last 6 months your prices got ridicoulous... 10eur a month for what, notes in cloud? If at least your full text search was stellar and your UX accross devices seamless. But even just attaching pics is pain. I wonder if there's export of my stuff. If not then your sooooooo lame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can tell the Evernote developers no longer care about the app because the response to the support email address below is This email address is not the designed channel for submitting new support requests."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"now limiting amount of notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have used your app for years. Now you want me to pay $14 a month, or I can't add more files? Sorry, but I can use Microsoft One Note for free. I would have considered paying if it had been less expensive. Bummed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was decent but doesn't do anything literally any other free note app does. No chance I'd ever pay for this, especially at the exorbitant price they're asking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slowly becoming more and more painful... Honestly you can't even use it without a pop up for an offer which they insist may never be available again, but of course always is every time you open the app. Will be changing platforms."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was Using this app for a years and the only limitation on free account was quantity of devices. I was fine with that. One for phone and one for laptop. Suddenly from nowhere to be informed upon creating new note. Now after i manage to have 89 of notes suddenly it becomes over limit. Not the best practice to engage customers. Done with it looking for alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over a decade. I was already over the endless prompts to upgrade, and then suddenly I was given the prompt that I only have a 50 note limit with the free version. I pared down my notes from 75ish to 46. I tried to create a new note and was given the same prompt repeatedly. Evernote was already a pretty bare-bones, basic choice when it was free. The services haven't changed, so I'm not going to start paying for it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is constant irritating nagware. Spend multiple actions just to start a note getting past all their ads. Now restricted to only 50 notes. Time to movecto and alternative. App is not worth $130p.a. just gouging longtime users, constantly moving the goalposts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gutting the free subscription has made Evernote unusable. I'm not going to pay upwards of $150 per year for a glorified electronic notebook, so it's bye bye for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's no longer free... Whatever limit they tell you is a lie"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Vary good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 10 years using this app, it is converting to ransomware. 10 years of my data is now being held hostage for $129/yr. Medical info, personal info, all of it. Don't make my mistake. Just use Google Notes like everyone else. 90% + will have to be deleted and would still be too difficult to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalling due to new 50 note limit on free version. UI has gotten worse over the years and the constant spam pop-ups to subscribe is frustrating. Would recommend free note apps like Google keep or notion instead. No one should have to pay to keep notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's joke. App is so nice. But its just basic not text we all mostly do everyday. But they push you update membership every day 10 times. Price around yearly $120-$140 depend on day ,time whether or who play game. That's funny price. Guys if you do price yearly $10 . I will get updated. You will make more money than before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible organiser. I've used this app for almost 10 years (since 2014), and the past 2 have been degrading to the point of being unusable. Crossplatform synching is horrible. All my notes become corrupt, unable to open. I've tried uninstalling, updating, nothing works. Now I can't even log into my account after reinstalling the app. It won't register my email on the log on page and trying to log on with Google gives me an error message. One of the worst experiences I've had with an android app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, even on the free version, however it's become too buggy and needy. When declining upgrade offer: ""are you sure? You won't be able to get this offer back."" Next sign-in: ""we have this great upgrade offer for you!"" Did it to me TWICE while actually using the app! Am migrating my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If it was a one time $15 charge I might pay. Anything over $1.50/month for a NOTE TAKING APP is insanity. I've been on notefolio since 2014. This is some of the craziest shooting yourself in the foot I've ever seen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With such changes to pricing policy and a free plan they should have warned well in advance. The app itself is very slow now. Banners asking to upgrade are very annoying. No useful functionality have been added for the last couple of years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good, way too expensive. This is a powerful app when it comes to editing features: note-taking, creating projects, lists, etc. The font, paragraph, and insert options are plenty, and very useful. I've had some frustrating glitches when trying to switch to a different device: I get locked out everywhere until I can log in to my account from a PC and clean things up. I would be very interested in a reasonably paid version ($25/ year) but am not willing to dish out $130+ per year. So I'm leaving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Incredibly disappointed. Been using Evernote for years. Have hundreds of notes. I am ALL for supporting small businesses and would happily pay a reasonable one-time or even subscription fee for this service. But $130/year is FAR from reasonable. Jumping from FREE to $130 is especially insane. That's highway robbery. Pretty sure you just killed your app, bud. RIP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant ads and a 50 note limit. The ads aren't discreetly in the corner either. Almost everytime you sign in they ask you to upgrade to a paid version. I'm okay with limiting features behind a pay wall, but don't act like your product is free. Now they limit you to 50 notes. If Evernote can't find a way to monetize free users, don't offer a free product. I copied everything thing over to Google Keep Notes and called it a day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 10 years, I now have to sift through hundreds of notes to see which of my random thoughts are worth keeping or pay them the cost of a Netflix subscription to host <10mb of text files. I've heard good things about Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is no longer free for notes. 1 notebook, 50 notes, then you're done and you need to pay $20 a month for more notes. This even applies to people who have previously had notes, far more than 50, and more than 1 notebook. Thanks Evernote for blocking me from your software unless I give you $20 that I don't have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Users using the free version are now limited to only 50 notes and 1 notebook. If you want more you have to pay $130 a year. Evernote does not understand that it is just a note app. I'm transitioning over to a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great note taking app. Now every time you open it, it's a full screen ad, and limited features/use. Won't be back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another loyal customer lost here (8 years this time) due to corporate greed. Alternative platform now found. Hugely appreciated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"12/12/23 My free Evernote just stopped working and is demanding that I pay $130.00 per year if I want to use it. I am retired and just use it to file notes and occasionally a photo. I don't need or want all the extra bells and whistles. It has been working fine up till now. Has anyone migrated there Evernote to OneNote, and is it straight forward or hard to do. Thanks for the help. Bill Wolfe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for several years. Features have been gradually scaled back and ads have been getting worse over time. Finally today it's telling me I can't create any new notes unless I subscribe for $15/month or $130/year, even though I only have one notebook and six notes - nowhere near the 50-note limit. Just transferred all my notes to another app and will be uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"PLEASE RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS APP! I've been using Evernote since 2011. I opened EN this morning to add a note and found an extortionist prompt trying to force me to pay them $130/yr to add more than 50 notes. THIS IS THE BREAKING POINT. 😡 I will be migrating my nearly 4000 notes elsewhere and deleting this horrid app. Shame on Evernote's greedy executives and staff that use carrot and stick methods to trick people into paying them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fantastic app. I have been with it for years. I have over 250 notes saved. And recently, it become a money grab. It officially today while sitting in church ready to take my weekly notes for the service told me that my limit of 50 notes has been met and i would have to pay $129 to take more. How ridiculous that the free app that i used for several years decided to lose many of its original people. I hope people have better sense than to pay over $100 for something to record their own thoughts!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be a fantastic, simple, note taking app. As of recent updates, it's grown into a bloated monstrosity that annoyingly hounds you to pay for an overpriced subscription. I'll continue to use Evernote until I can find an app that behaves like older versions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the 50 notes limit is ridiculous. leaving and switching to a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not download!!! After years of having and loving this app they're trying charge you to write notes???? What a joke!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: changing from 5 stars to 1 stars, simply because of what Evernote pulled on 4th of December.... (free users now are only allowed to have two notebooks with a maximum of 50 notes...). With this move, I've instantly uninstalled and deleted my account, and migrated to an open source solution that has almost the same capabilities as Evernote. It's a shame, but I used to love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not using often and the free plan was fitting to my usage. And the suddenly it doesn't allow to add notes if you have more than 50 notes. No early warnings, or email about it. Just an email, after being blocked stating that from dec 4th there is this new policy.. 99€/y for keep using it. Time to move to more serious alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No I will not buy your plan. I have confirmed it and you keep saying that I will not get 'this' offer again. Stop shoving it in my face everytime I open the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After several years I'm finally going to ditch evernote. It constantly asks me to upgrade, which I'm not going to do because all I want is something to store text notes, and it's too expensive for that. And it's sluggish. The final straw is that I can no longer create a new note... I just get stuck in a New > Note > Upgrade? > No > back-to-the-homepage loop. Infuriating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Over the 4-year long usage experience, the app got a bunch of unnecessary features, useless redesign, increased number of reminders to subscribe, and a ridiculous limit of 50 existing notes and 1 notebook per user. It also became slower. If you need a fancy modern app with all sorts of trending features, AI integrations, and you are ready to pay for them - this app may be for you. For me - they introduced what I didn't ask for, and now made app unusable without a subscription. So I am leaving."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are you kidding me? Only 50 notes for free? No thank you, i think everyone has a unlimited notes app on their phone. I used Evernote because i loved the interface, but im not paying just for a stupid interface"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Can't open notes most times. It takes me sometimes 5 tries to open the note before it actually displays. Sometimes create new doesnt even work. As a notes app you have one job. Make notes, look at notes. Evernote manages to fail in both departments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow. They really ruined this app with truly egregious pricing. Imposing limitations on features that users already had, instead of improving the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since at least 2018. I had four notebooks and 405 notes. Now suddenly the max limit is FIFTY? I'm migrating elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Service was relatively good, I use it for years. But now they became way too greedy and non sense, and simply forced people to pay for a monthly fee otherwise you can't even create a new note. I am completely disappointed for the disrespect and greediness. I recommend not even trying it for free, better to explore other options in the market. The company lost the values. If I am going to pay, I rather give it to someone else. Your strategy are pushing people away 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have really enjoyed this app up until now. Was reviewing my finances and realised I've been subscribed to premium without my knowledge with them syphoning £6 a week from my account. Fuming doesn't even begin... And when you try to cancel the subscription, shock horror. That's impossible to find."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ruined by new update. Stupid subscription pop ups every time I open it, and it's now saying I've reached my limit of 50 notes even though I only have 29. Deleted some notes and it still won't let me create new ones. Garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been slowly falling off. It gets worse and slower gradually. Now they want to charge for basic features. Forget it, I'll just use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have 1 notebook and 23 notes but every time I try to add a note it tells me that I've reached my limit of 1 notebook and 50 notes and it suggests to upgrade to premium to add more notes. The prices are too high as well, might as well use the default notes app at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only have 15 notes and 1 notebook and still they are saving limit reached whereas the basic free plan says 1notebook and 50 notes allowed...they arnt letting me make new notes even though I still should be able to make 35 more new notes since the limit is 50...they have just ruined the app now for charging money ..useless tactics played by team Evernote. Worst experience..now shifting to another note saving app... disgusting move Evernote 👎🏿"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just went into the Evernote app to create a note like I have for the past 12 years and was met with a screen telling me I can't create any more notes unless I pay $130/year. Outrageous! This was sudden and without warning. Evernote has been going downhill for a while now, but this was a slap in the face. Time to move on!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for 3 years and it's now requiring a subscription. I would have paid a 1 time fee for it but never a subscription. I'm moving my notes somewhere else and deleting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version severely limited now. Full version very expensive for noted. Much better apps are available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This used to be a great program in free mode. There was a limitation on how many times one can add new records per day or week but that was it. Now they limit the maximum of total records to 50, which is totally insufficient, and keep trying to get you to pay their expensive subscription. I stopped using it and switched to another free program which does work. Bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I happily used this to write my first two novels. It did not overwhelm with unnecessary features, and just let me work. I liked the sync feature, and the html export. I am now uninstalling and looking for an alternative. Evernote is too slow to respond to the many complaints that their product doesn't play well with Gboard, and I can't write another chapter because my notes are now limited. This is no longer the app I fell in love with. I'm sorry - we're breaking up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Looks like this is the end. They have been trying to force us to pay for years and now they have done it. Bye Felicia."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now this app is Pay or leave, I've been using it for many years I have hundreds of notes and I can't add more.. So I'm leaving now for NOTION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been with Evernote since 2010, over 200 notes. Last couple years this app has become a money grabbing dumpster fire. Asking me to upgrade, slow and sluggish, not responsive. Opened the app today to see I can only have 50 free notes, get bent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Let me preface this by saying up until now I was a big advocate for Evernote. I switched over from onenote around 2016 and have been using Evernote daily ever since. I've always recommended it. But now Evernote has given its users a choice. Pay us monthly or you only can make 50 notes a month. What a laughably low number. For years there was no limit on notes. I go through that in a week. So now I have to pay, or take notes elsewhere. I'm moving to Samsung notes. Anything is better tho"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Definitely not paying for this. Guess I have to copy and paste my notes somewhere else. This new policy is complete BS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Alright I'm officially done with this app. I could take the constant advertising, but now I have some note limit that I didn't have before. I have 172 notes, and now you want to tell me I'm over my limit of 50??? It's a notepad app for God's sake, why would ANYONE pay $130 a year for this. I'm used to this app as I've had it for 5+ years, but I'll be looking for a new app and transferring my notes out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New pricing is absurd. Should not charge more than $5 for personal per month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been my go-to for note-taking, and I don't have plan to upgrade. I think it's a bad choice to limit it to only 1 notebook and 50 notes. Though I've been using Evernote since 2020, and now I will find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this for years and now being limited to one notebook and 50 notes... Goodbye Evernote. I don't use it enough to warrant the cost per year. Looking for another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely horrible experience. Buggy, but it had so much potential. New subscription plan is plain blackmailing, take it or leave it offer. I never experienced something as bad from any other developer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You deal with these people at your peril. I've used the app for over 10 yrs and have precious data stored there. Just recently to access my data I have been advised that I have pay $130 just to look at my information. They didn't even give me time to access the data to try and get some of it out by cutting and pasting some of my information to an honestly run app. It should be a criminal offence to suck you into leaving your data with them only to have them blackmail you into getting it back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote you have failed your user base. Looking at recent reviews, I'm not the only one thinking your 50 note limit and absurd prices are the breaking point. Been using since 2013 and it used to be so good. It's a shame your note limit and high prices are making so many people leave enernote in the past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using this since 2012. Was free on a limited number of devices. That ship has sailed. I'm leaving too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Retroactively edited their plans. The free plan now has 50 notes, I had 400 when they changed this. I now can't make a new note until I delete 351 notes. I'll just keep the app as a grave yard. Its literally unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has gotten much better since I first started to use it. That was back in 2013. Now I suspect they hired new people with many bad changes to the app. Good Bye Evernote 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Now the new policy is to hold hostage our notes, and not allow us to add any new notes beyond 50. Whenever I try to add a new note, I'm hit with a paywall. Moving to obsidian bye Evernote, it's been a great 11 years. Old-- This new swipe right to close the note is a pain. Very sensitive to the slightest movement. Trying to scroll a large note has proven to be challenging. And the app seems sluggish; I first noticed it when they added the new checklist and other buttons. --"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Expensive and useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good. Now the free version just keeps getting less and less useful. Just finished deleting all but 1 existing notebook just to add a note. in the past you could have mutiple notebooks. Had to move all my notes to a single notebook and also now 50 notes max. I know im not paying, but don't offer a free version if you can't support it. I dont use it enough to justify over $100 a year. After all this I cant recall the note i was going to add. I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly free plan only supports 50 notes and I have 65 and unable to create new ones or really delete previous ones either. App ruined. Uninstalling. Could have made the limit to 100 or something."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Former superfan of 10 years+. The new updates crash daily. It does not sync properly. Even as a paid pro user there was no support. Now it pesters me with constant ads. So sad a wonderful app was ruined."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 50 notes!? That's ridiculous! Utterly unacceptable! I'd rate this as -5 stars. Anyone who's responsible for this worst change ever should immediately resign!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great. Now only trying to sell you something. Switching to a new notes platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had been using evernote for a longtime and with every update it had just been just degrading. Yet, being habitual to this app, I wasn't switching but now they have added a limit to 50 notes? And what's with that price of subscription? I guess its time to switch. Well, congratulations to the developers!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a 5 star review. Used it since 2015 now I can't add another note unless I pay 130$ a year. So now I am forced to transfer notes and will be using Google keeps instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: This app is a disgusting money-grubbing joke now. Please look elsewhere. PLEASE update this to where it doesn't crash after 10 seconds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to rate this app 5 stars. Been using for over 10 years and now all of a sudden there's a push to force customers to pay outrageous prices for a basic notes app. 50 note limit? I have over thousands of notes over the year and now I can't use this app because developers want to join the subscription cults and force customers of decades to pay insane prices for the app thats always been free. What an absolute joke these guys have become. Will watch the downfall of Evernote from the sidelines."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Still good ^^"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had it for years, now the new annual/monthly plan prompted me to find new note app. It was nice while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"130 a year? Naw. Been using ever note for over 10 years, have about 300 notes (recipes mostly) and now they limit it to 50? I would pay for storage but not that much. It's just storage 🤦🏼‍♀️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Months of pop up prompt notifications to pay for expensive packages and now a paywall. Now I have to pay what I can't afford or I can't make any new notes. I know they want their money but this is not the way to do it. What a shameful way to repay your loyal customers. A 50 note limit is an absolute joke. Previously an excellent app but I will not stand for this ransom. Will move on to another app. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for free for years. I only use it for a grocery list or if I need to remember something quick, I can no longer make any free notes at all. It wants me to pay for a subscription. Why does EVERYTHING need a subscription these days?pay a couple bucks for a no ads version sure, but why pay monthly? Not to mention, Microsoft office and Google both have features where you can do the same things... Just absolutely pointless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I went to add a note and found out that they are Only allowing 50 notes and requiring a subscription of $149 a year. Very disappointing as I've used them for years. Poor decision on their part, especially for Private use to require that ridiculous amount of money annually for a note app, Not even for a one time payment is it worth it feel especially since they've locked up taking screenshots and other deficiencies with the app over the last couple years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app is simply to use and it's best app for everything; data, pics, reminders...whatever you need. I love it and recommended to all! Deserves 5⭐ Edit: Gave the five stars eight years ago. Today I'm not sure if they deserve three. Now its complicated and annoying with premium offer. In fact, if you don't take premium, it's like any other app for notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous price gouging. Will be switching to a free application after using Evernote for a few years. It was not perfect but did an okay job. But trying to charge for this frankly just okay service is ridiculous and embarrassing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Revised down to 2 stars. Fed up with ALL the invitations to purchase"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote in my opinion is the best note taking app I've ever used but that's also the issue; it's just an app for note taking and when you compare Evernote to something like Microsoft 365 which gives you access to all of Microsoft office and whole Terabyte of cloud storage for 6.99 compared to Evernote's 14.99 and it just being a note taking app, I feel like the pricing doesn't make it worth it. So I'm sad to say I'm leaving Evernote not because of it quality but because of its pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was already annoyed with being consistently hounded about upgrading, but now that incessant poking has turned into intense arm twisting I am getting a different note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote user of 8 years. Now, they have a new 1 notebook 50 notes policy. Made the app unusable. I spent about 20 hours porting 355 notes (36 notebooks) to an alternative. The pricing hike is ridiculous. I could do €3/month at MOST but not €13/month!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for years & suddenly, it won't let me add any more notes until I start paying (even though it says there is a 50 limit.. I only have 19)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited in 50 notes after all these years looks like bad joke. Goodbye evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Putting irritating popup ads up to force people to pay to do anything is not a great way to maintain your client base."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New upgrade suck, only limit to 50 notes a force you to pay a monthly suscription. I like the app, but with these prices, I prefer to save my notes in another place. At least create a lifetime purchase"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"way to go making your absurd subscription for a NOTES app mandatory I hope you guys go under soon ❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free users can now only make one notebook and 50 notes. Lmao. A joke of an app. Plenty of alternatives out there. Don't pay this greedy company a cent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really frustrated with the recent changes, used this for years now your only allowed 50 notes or pay £2.50 per week, it's madness this app isn't worth £10 per month, I'd think about paying £1 a month for the convince but really it's poor from the company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a really good app back when I first installed it in 2014. Now they have limited the free plan to 1 notebook and 50 notes. I'm not paying $130 a year for notetaking. My account has several notebooks and notes because I have been using this before the change. So now i have to find a new notes app and transfer all this information. And of course there's no easy way to export this because that's in a paid plan probably."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2011. I'm quite a low intensity user of the free version but it's got more and more restrictive until the latest change limiting use to 50 notes and one notebook means it's no longer usable without paying a subscription fee. It's just not worth it when there are great free apps out there so I'll be off, and trying to figure out how to export my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new update limits app to 1 notebook and 50 notes only! , so free version is now useless. Find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I found Evernote a little glitchy and difficult to use from my beginning a few years ago, before it became incredibly slow and required closing multiple adverts before writing or reading anything. Now they expect you to pay for this mess. Enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for mqny years but now this update says that u can only write 59 notes and 1 note book for a month that's so mean. I m saying goodbye forever to EN. There are so many options available why to waste you time with such cheap app with cheqp tricks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So desperate for money that there are constant pop ups and now limits to the amount of notes. Moving everything to Google now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limits me to 50 notes even though I have been using this app for many years. Looks like I will search for a better app for writing we many notes without limit"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app and used it for many years. Discovered last night that as of December 2023, the free version of Evernote now limits users to 1 notebook and 50 notes (and existing users with more than that can only edit or delete their existing notes which are above the new limit), which means I will be moving on and finding an alternative. RIP free Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app and had an account since 2014 but with the new change to 1 notebook and 50 notes I can no longer create new notes so sort of a useless app for me now. Based on another review I'm going to use Google Keep as I already pay for Google One and it does what I needed from Evernote. Going through the process of deleting my account now and will uninstall shortly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New pricing is way too high"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another long time user that is beyond disappointed with the newly-instituted ""50 note"" limit. I have been using Evernote for almost 10 years, and it has always been a convenient place to keep information, lists, etc. I refer back to frequently. The 50 note limit makes it useless, and $150 a year is an outrageous price for the upgrade. I have stuck around despite the company chipping away at features over the years, but this is too much. Will have to find a new app/program and begin transferring"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$130 per year for a note taking app? You've got to be kidding me! I wouldn't mind paying for the app if the cost was even close to reasonable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"First device limit, now note limit? Evernote is officially dead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can create only 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How does this app have a 4 star rating. Most of the reviews are one star due to the new subscription business model. Don't waste your time. And I mean YOUR TIME. Many of the people reviewing the app are long time users of this app. So am I. I keep lyrics, poems and actual recordings of songs. For years. And now with the new update all of it amounts to wasted time. The app wether you pay or not is not worth it. All of the new updates make it into an awful user interface. Don't get this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great. Was free. Now it's not. 5p note limit. Bye. Plenty of free note apps including my phone's default."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent wave of one star reviews should be a clear sign that y'all screwed up a good thing. Hope it was worth it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Love being able to make important notes, appts and reminders without writing on scraps of paper or in a calendar. I never have to fear forgetting anything. Edited: Using for nearly 2yrs. now. Love that it syncs to my computer! I never have to worry that my songwriting ideas will be lost if my phone ""crashes"". Thank you, Evernote Team! :) Edited 12/15/23: With the sudden forced one notebook & 50 notes limit or pay, I'll be moving on. Bye, EN. It was a good 10+ years while it lasted. :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Congrats, after years of worsening this app you finally forced me to move to an alternative. Enjoy your failing business model."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a super app until new ownership took over. I had been a member since November 2009. I had 30 notebooks and 958 notes. Suddenly the company determined one notebook and 50 notes maximum for the free account! This is so wrong. I could not open Evernote while I'm in a conference call needing to look up something. I was desperate and did the one week trial. That gave me enough time to empty my account. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly met with an artificial 50 note limit. To continue using pay 100€ per year. Yeah right, ever heard of Google Docs?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why can't I no longer write? Dumb move. I'll move my notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have to pay if you want 50+ notes. I have 41 and an unable to create a new note without upgrading. After year's of use the slow death of the free version has forced me to find an alternative. Shocking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years. Now you have to pay $199 to use..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Random crashes, only in android app. Seems to work ok on windows app. Could be great if bugs ironed out as it feels like we are the beta testing grounds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hate the new notes and notebooks limit, made the app unusable now and I have to find an alternative Also, keeps lagging recently and I have to keep restarting the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved this app prior to the aggressive ads and out-of-touch pricing. I suspect the decision came from leadership that doesn't understand their user base. I only need to take notes and organize them easily... I'd willingly pay $3-5/mo for that basic convenience. For $10-20/mo, I could get a whole suite of tools on another platform. Hate to leave an app I've been using 10+yrs but if it remains by January, I'll 100% be going elsewhere and not look back. Good luck with your enterprise flop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I started using Evernote as my primary note taking and writing app in 2021, and was impressed by its features back then. Now... Mimicking other reviews of late (12/2023), these features have been pay-walled by the profit hungry someone who decides these things. Extreme disappointment, resulting in search for a new writing platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for several years, have hundreds of notes in it. Over the past year, each update they make has made the app worse, and now they've limited the free version to only 50 notes. And the subscription fee is absolutely outrageous for an app that doesn't even work as well as it used to when it was FREE! Forget it! I'll be finding a new note app going forward. I used to rave about this app, now it's just a joke. Whoever took over the development and management of it has ruined it. ☹️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After many years to change a free app to a subscription only app is disappointing. Can't create any new notes without paying. At least they waited for Google's new free note app to be available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's now how much?!?!! Are you high? Fastest way to go from 5 stars to 1 star. Used and recommended to others for 13 years, now I'm embarrassed that I told anyone about it. Switched to Notion with no regrets."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"8. Years. And now you lock me out? I've got birthdays, home projects, bills, literally my whole life on there. Unbelievable. I'm so disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slow application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So now instead of limiting just the amount of storage, you've limited the number of notes and now want to charge $129.00 a year for it. No thank you. I'll soon be transfering all my notes to Google and will cease using this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Edit 12/15/23: I have been using Evernote for many years, and have been mostly very pleased with it. I have thousands of notes. But I'm knocking off two stars today with their lockdown of the app unless we start paying at least $130 a year. I'm not someone who thinks we're owed everything for free, especially considering it's ad-free. It involves work and expenses and they have to make money somehow. BUT $15 a month for a note taking app?? $45/yr or $5/mo would be high but at least not absurd."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seriously limiting users who uses evernote for years. Now I am switching to other app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2009, but the free product is no longer viable and I'll be looking for a replacement. The aggressive prompts to subscribe were irritating when they were about a one-time offer that was available every single time I opened the app and I was sticking around because of inertia, but the downgrade to a single notebook and 50 notes with no ability to create more unless I pay is enough to push me to migrate. I am not interested in another ongoing subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this for ages in different ways. Now an occasional user, suddenly limited to 50 notes and no possibility to batch delete in the app. Seem to be looking for new commercial models but instead chasing away users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I see one more notification, I'm going to use another note app. That's what i said a few months ago. Now I'm never going to see them again because their new free plan only allows 50 notes. I have thousands. Your app was nice while it lasted but subscription vs pro version is what killed it for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to say goodbye after using it since 2014"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed in this app and the ""features"" that were once free that you now have to pay for. Will be deleting and finding a new notes app today. What a shame, this was a great app once."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update limiting me to 50 notes made my decision to delete very easy. Avoid at all cost"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very bad camera feature take picture automatically"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reviewed in 2012 at 5 stars. Recent update restricting free users to 50 notes and 1 notebook total made it useless for me. I'm not playing a subscription for a note-taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cant believe you are asking for £79 a year. Total rip off. This app used to be great for just making simple notepads/notes. Now I cant even add to the notepad I have without being over the limit. Going elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once was a great app, but, now, you only allow one notebook with 50 notes for the free plan. I'm flabbergasted. I don't mind a limit, but that's a little ridiculous. I can't afford $14.99 a month, and certainly not $129.99 a year. No wonder you're in the top 10 grossing apps... I guess it's time to move on..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for nearly a decade but with the recent limitations I am abandoning it for greener free pastures. Bye bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tldr; changed features=bad choice. I started using the app in Nov. I was looking for something to organize my ideas, as I was outgrowing my notes app on my phone. This app was perfect. I made all the book ideas their own notebook and was able to organize how I'd like inside them. I went back today with a new idea it wouldn't even let me add a note to an existing notebook saying I've reached the limit of 1 notebook and 50 notes. They want 130 for a year to upgrade. Or like 14 monthly. No way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's good 😆"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full of ads and more and more limited functionality"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app since 2016 and while it was good then it barely works now. Notes crash or don't open, when I go back the app closes, and there's a god awful screen rotate problem. Now I've been retroactively paywalled out of using it. I no longer recommend this app to people and I will not be supporting an app that seems to only be getting worse and more malicious. Instead I'll begin the lengthy process of moving all my 600 notes elsewhere. It's really dissapointing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription? Now I can't create new notes unless I pay???? No thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You made my life easier all this decade but now by limiting free users with 50 notes you made me switch to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy developers getting more and more ridiculous. Constant spamming asking you to upgrade to their paid subscriptions. And now they suddenly decided to limit free members to 50 notes. I've been using Evernote for 5 years and have 400+ notes. This is finally the kick in the teeth for me to change note-taking app. Been meaning to for a while but this is seriously the last straw"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why are you suddenly forcing an upgraded service to keep using your app? I'm not happy about that at all! I've been using this app since 2013 and I have way more than the newly limited 50 notes for the free version! There is no way to go through them all to select 'most important' notes or old ones to delete for new space. They are all necessary. The only thing left to do is upgrade. Sorry, you won't force my hand on that, not at that price. I'll move on first. Disappointing to say the least!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They force me to use paid plan by not allowing to create new note not even though i didnt reach free limit. Shame I am meber since 2009, im deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"If you don't have a photographic memory. I couldn't do without it. I have everything in here from my grocery list to authors I want to read to measurements for the grandbabies crib sheets. And even better it syncs between my tablet, my laptop and my phone Edit: my notes from the past 6 years have now disappeared. It says I can have 50 notes on the freeversion but won't allow me to make even one. Deleting this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since I was 12 (15 years ago now) and they've finally convinced me to move to a different app (probably Google's keep notes). Firstly it was buggy which I could live with, then started asking me to get paid membership multiple times every time I used the app, then made the free version only usable on ONE DEVICE AT A TIME, then said with the free version I can only make 50 notes?! All whilst still being buggy as hell. I'm now cleaning up my notes and copying them over."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There are now bugs in the notes, where if I cut and paste from the middle of the text, it will cut out much more than it copied. Also missing a batch delete or batch export to PDF option. 10 years of using this app, just to realize I should have used Google Keep instead for the basic way I use it, no way this is worth more than 20 bucks to me. At least they're letting us access our notes the time to switch them to another app! Just realizing how much trust I've put in a company to store info"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has gone from good to bad to worst now. It is very slow in my phone and takes ages to also. Now after the new update, it limits to 1 notebook and 50 notes forcing you to become premium member."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My problem is the same like all the other reviews. Suddenly Evernote decides to charge everyone money, for more notes and notebooks. Very greedy and a rude move from the company given that there are better alternatives. Its safe to say that Evernote will lose many customers (including myself) because of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time lover of Evernote. So disappointed in the update to the app requiring $15 a month for more than 50 notes. Seems like unreal pricing to save a few words. I would have subscribed a long time ago if prices were more reasonable. I'm sad, Evernote - why would you do this? The app has behaving terribly lately too, losing notes and requiring me to open and close the app over and over. So so disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Account not upgraded after paying for subscription. Despite contacting the developers no response from their side. No provision for customer care or grievance redressal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for over four years now, have over 111 notes already, and all of a sudden I'm not allowed to make new notes on the app unless I pay over $100 for a year? The limit is apparently now only 50 notes. Not only that, but in recent months, some of my notes haven't even been saving. I'll write out an entire note and click save only to come back later to an empty note. This was a bad decision to make,considering your long term users, I will now be finding a new notes app instead"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good aap using since 2013"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Same like all other free users, not happy about the limit of 50 notes unless upgrade, installing onenote now.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now limits you to 50 notes. What a completely incompetent app developer. I'm sorry but the main task performed by this app can be so easily duplicated by countless other apps *for absolutely no cost* - yet you think it's a good idea to start limiting your free users on the number of notes they can create? Seriously? What a joke. I will be slowly migrating all of my notes over to a free app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"goodbye to evernote. use it over 12 years, watching it became more disgusting each year. anyway, i switched to other app. fire your marketing officer"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I just wrote to say good bye. Evernote has been a part of my journalling. It was excellent, perfect for what i need. I guess this time around, we need to part ways. It's been almost 7 good yrs with you. I am just currently thinking how will i back up all my notes all at once to another app or on my desktop. I need to back them up before Evernote closes my acct as i don't have any plans to upgrade my acct. Lol."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Issues with functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limit of 50 notes for free version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately the prices are no longer justifiable. Can't create new notes, so I'll stick to other apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If i could give you 0 star i will! Suddently, you have to pay for writting notes? Hell no, i'm moving to another app! That's really a dumb move for the evernote team. I hope you loose most of your users"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Part of my notes disappear, I looked into your premium options and both options are expensive. I don't use this app enough to justify $15 a month. If it was $5 a month that I could actually justify. Now you are requiring people to pay the ridiculous amount to be able to make new notes. Guess I'll be finding a new app. If you had a $5 / month plan for us, that I would consider but nope, over $100 a year is not worth it for an occasional user like me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for well over 10 years and have tons of notes and multiple notebooks. I opened the app today to find that no longer be able to use the app unless pay $130yr or $15/month, which is unrealistic. It stated that if I want to make even one more note I had to pay. The developers have made a foolish move charging a subscription fee, especially at that price. What would I even be paying for at that price? And yearly? There are plenty of other free apps without ads too. Pass"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The best most professional notes app on here.., or was. There is a huge push to upgrade in every section. You no longer have unlimited notes, and there was no notification on the downgrade. I'm sorry but I'm uninstalling. Congratulations, you fkd it up 🙃"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No longer can open app. Website does not address issue, updating does not work and now left with $15.99/mo. app that I cannot use. I get a cryptic fault message that I cannot get past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for many years. Now after the update it is unusable. I have 11 notes, 39 below the limit of 50 and I still can not add more. NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it was one of the best note taking apps for over a decade, but unfortunately Evernote has severely restricted it's note taking options for free users. It was a good run, RIP evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update December 2023. I used this app for three years. I really liked it. (Before this I gave it 5 stars) But now it wouldn't let me create more notes. I only had 12 notes well below the new limit of 50 for free users. I even deleted some old notes and even before that I wasn't over 50."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this application for over a decade and had no complaints until recently. The flagrant attempt to extort money from its loyal users is disgusting. The limit of 50 notes and 1 notebook is absolutely insulting. The price of $130 a year is ridiculous. It's a ransom for over 10 years of writing and memories that are being held hostage. This is gross."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over 10 years. It's a useful tool. But now, without warning, they want over $120 per year for one app ? Nah, I'll switch to OneNote and get my money's worth with their full suite of apps. Someone at Evernote lost their greedy mind. 🤣"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since day1, about 10 years, now and with the limitations of the free version, i gone to google keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Samsung s-pen don't works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What a great app. I've kept track of time cards for many years. Free on my phone and computer. BUT they have decided to strong arm me into $129 a year because I have ""reached my limit"" a limit that has never existed prior to reaching it. I have met the 50 notes limit probably 50 times over. Loved this app but NO THANK YOU to the overpriced subscription. I found a free replacement in Google Keep almost the same only free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paywall can't add more notes. Adding a paywall preventing me from using the primary feature of the app is a guaranteed way to make me switch to a different app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow!! Limited to 50 notes now?? Moving all my notes and uninstalling.. prices they asking for is outrageous... All these apps, games, companies are all greedy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Intrusive popups, terrible new mandatory paid subscription for 50 notes or more, screwing over all previous free users. Avoid Evernote like the plague"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The limit of 50 notes and one notebook is making me leave. Had for years to just keep track of an occasional note or so. Avoid unless you feel like paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is good but it does require a subscription to use. There is a free version that allows up to 50 notes and a notebook, however it stopped me from being able to use it after writing only 8 notes, and won't let me write the 42 notes I was supposed to get without sending me to a paywall asking for $15 a month or $130 a year. Pretty steep for a note app. 🥲"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Highly recommend going to a different app, unless you want to pay $130 per year for basic features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has really gone down hill to the point where its unusable now, which is a shame because I've been using it for about 10 years. It's so slow, unreliable, unresponsive for clipping webpages, and the search tool is terribly inaccurate. The amount of ads for the paid service slows from loading and they happen so frequently that it makes the app unusable. It doesn't have any redeemable qualities anymore. I'd rather have a pocket full of wet drawn on napkins than this clunky app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for about a decade. I use it on my PC and my phone, and that is it. I'm furious and devastated by the decision you've made regarding membership. I'm a medium user. I essentially use Evernote as Notepad Plus. Stuff that is small enough that it would be a literal waste of money to even get the personal plan. I don't need a membership and I really can't afford one. it feels like a stab in the back that poverty is the barrier here. Clearly, I am finding another option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love evernote (used it for 10 years). The new pay walls have really put me off."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am so disappointed in this App now. You got greedy!! I have been using this for over 10 years. It was wonderful. It slowly disintegrated. With pay for this or pay for more of that. Now I have to upgrade, and pay 160$ a year to create a note! You guys suck!! And will be moving platforms! I understand cooperations and providing and paying for certain perks to anyone who needs it. But the average person who wants to create a note or two a week or so?! Greedy!!! That's all I have to say! 🖕"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years and have never seen a company dig themselves into the dirt faster than the developers of this one have. Greed has ruined a wonderful product that I've grown to love immensely since I began using it. Now, though, I cannot justify continuing to support the level of blatant disrespect they treat their customers with. I'll be switching to another note-taking app moving forward and I suggest that everyone reading do the same. Evernote is no longer worth your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was superior note app, must be phasing out... New update is a scam, have to have a monthly or annual $$$ subscription to keep and access more than 50 notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: 50 notes!? I have 900. Goodbye Evernote you have been useful but for me, not worth paying for, sorry. It's buggy now on pixel 6. Crashes a lot. Tells me I'm using too many devices but nothings changed? Too many prompts to buy premium. I might look for a premium note app but it won't be this one it's too unreliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been using this app for more than 10 years. However, now the restrictions of only one notebook and 50 notes has made it impossible for me to further use this app. I am deeply disappointed as this used to be one of my favourite and most reliable apps. And now I have to look for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is now pay to use. Which is just ridiculous for an notebook app. I'm sorry I'm not paying 130$ a year for a notebook. It sucks I'll have to find another place to store all I've written over the past 5 years. They even took away the option to screen shot your own notes. Which is just annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2013 and have 1,300 notes. I am upset to suddenly find out that we're now limited to 50 notes unless we pay for it. I wouldn't mind so much except: 1. The quality of the app has gone downhill, I've been having an issue with notes not saving 2. We weren't given any advance notice. It feels like Evernote doesn't value its existing users 2. The upgrade is very expensive. $15/month is a lot for a phone app and to go from free to $15/mo is a big jump. It's not worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent change to limit to 50 free notes and 1 notebook is equal to telling a long-time user like me with more than 50 notes to not use this app unless we pay for it. Well, I'm not going to pay for such an app used for just storing notes. It was a great app a few years ago. Now, nope."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited rating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 9/5/21: The app will not open. It's starts to load and immediately crashes. Once I can retrieve my content, I'm switching to another note taking app.Long time user. Also seriously dislike the new user interface. It's clunky. Update 12/14/23: No you can only create up to 50 notes without paying $129.99 a year? What a f-ing joke this app has become. I will be moving my content to another platform and uninstalling as soon as possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy and too expensive. Goodbye after so many years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for 6 years. Sad to say that app has become a utter failure after all. No back button function. UI is not friendly at all. Lags every time even on a flagship mobile. It doesn't even load the notes properly and still they want us to pay a premium monthly. App developers, be reasonable. Give us a good product first and then ask for a monthly payment. Finally, Your app will be abandoned by the users very soon if you do not pay the attention to these problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Max 50 notes really, go to hell Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If Evernote was a person it would be a letchy, drunk man on a park bench hitting on you several times a day. Ever heard of ""no means no"", Evernote? Why don't you make an app I actually want to pay for instead of desperately begging for my money every day. Aaand.. delete."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app works well, but the constant ""Premium offers""popups is why I uinstalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not like how I am not able to make new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A company that not only is desperate for your money and tells you everyday to pay them, now they have a ridiculous 50 notes limit and also had to move all my data because they had serious security issues couple years ago and some random dudes from china logged into my account no probs. I moved all notes and never coming back. Stay away from this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved it to begin with. Put up with multiple crashes over the years, resulting in me losing notes. For months I endured those constant 'reminders' to upgrade. And now I'm blocked from even adding a simple note ?!? Not impressed at all! Evernote is not giving me a choice but to look for an alternative..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible! They are now forcing customers to PAY to have more than 50 notes or 1 notebook!!! This is outrageous!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this used to be an amazing app. now I am limited on only being able to create a couple notebooks, which wouldn't be an issue if I wasn't limited to only creating a couple notes. this app is useless unless you want to pay $179 to organize you own thoughts. I'm going back to folders and notepad. this app which used to offer so much for free that I was willing to pay for it now bearly gives you anything and wants you to pay way to much. not worth this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you for making it easier to decide whether I should stay or go. Your pricing isn't realistic for a simple notes keeping and a day to day usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After close to 10 years, across several different devices, I will not be using evernote anymore, and will be transferring all of my notes to Google Docs. The ad wall put up today is nothing short of ridiculous. Paying $130 to use an app is obscene. After a year+ of relentless ads in app to pay for the extras, they have finally decided to force you to pay for almost the whole thing. I no longer recommend. Do not use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App was great, I've been using it for quite some time, but it became stuttery which wasn't an issue at first. But now the devs are asking for a subscribtion model and are limiting the amount of notes you can have if you are a free consumer. I don't even have 50 notes on the app but it won't even let me create a new one(50 notes is the maximum amount you can make now), so I guess it's time to find another app for notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The advertising and constant push for you to give them money is unbearable. This app has gone majorly downhill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great until they sold out to another company and change the service plans in December. Moved to joplin, it's free, it's self hosted, and you keep your data local"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this since 2010,all of a sudden I have to pay a minimum of $129.00 a year to use the app. I don't mind paying a reasonable one time fee but this is ridiculous. It's not worth $129.00 year! I'm going to move all my stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: now I can't create new notes without upgrading for over $100. I guess it's time to move on from Evernote! What a disappointment! I've used this app for years but it's become really difficult to scroll through lots of notes in a notebook through the app on my phone. If you go a tiny bit off up and down, it will go back to the home page and you have to start the search all over again. This used to be the best notes app but now I won't even consider upgrading due to the issues it has."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moving to a different app. Evernote was never perfect to begin with, e.g. having text formatting issues. Then there was a major interface overhaul which didn't make the app better, but did make it slower. A ton of features were added, shich we free users didn't even ask for. And now the ridiculous 50 notes limit. I once considered purchasing the full version, but the aforementioned overhaul and, to a greater extent, the high price deterred me. Sorry, but I will move to a simpler and cheaper app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app went from free to charging us"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new restriction to one notebook and 50 notes for free users makes this app unusable now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote that used to be user friendly has completely turned outrightly greedy wanting everyone both old and new users be forced to pay for insanely fee for an unwanted upgrade. How could you have created something good and throw it down the drain by yourself? Very unwise. Well if your app has become that obstinate, I trust greater percentage of your customers will fly away elsewhere. Good luck to you if you destroyed what you built over the years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. It was my go-to, and I have about 8 years' worth of notes on it. No more. They've made the utterly outrageous decision to limit EXISTING customers to 50 notes. No grandfathered plan. Nothing. ""Start paying us $130/yr, or you'll never be able to create a new note again."" Nope. What a joke. Bye forever, Evernote. 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dying app BEWARE. Have recently implemented extreme limitations to note quantity to force pay. Used to be the best in class. Like with everything online though, have decided that limiting functionality for money is the way forward. Failed for most every other app that did that. Let's see how it works here for an app with SO many good alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for 13 years (2010). Overall, it WAS a good experience. Recently, there have been more and more restrictions on using the app. Today the app would not let me create new content without signing up/paying for a subscription plan. This is the final straw, I will not pay for a app that I only use for basic text notes. I will be migrating out of the Evernote app into an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's very sad they have limted to 50 notes to free users. I've been a happy user for many years with hundreds of notes. Thinking on moving to another service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Congratulations, Evernote. You played yourself. 50 note limit unless I pay $130/yr? I've used this app for free over 10 years and 500 notes later I sadly have seen nothing but this app's decline. Good job killing your company in one fell-swoop. I hope that your idea-man got that corner office after all, because he won't have it for much longer - will he?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I now have to pay monthly to create more than 50 notes? I'm considering moving over to another note-taking app as soon as I can effortlessly move every note I have. I am incredibly disappointed in the creators for this decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly being FORCED to pay with popups that never ever end, daily saying it's the ""last chance"" to upgrade. Endless crashing. I used to love Evernote so dearly. In the last few years it's been a steady decline. I've never been so disappointed as when I lost 6 hours of writing due to Evernote crashing. Things I couldn't rewrite.. and there was NO emergency recovery service. None. And after all that, you now have to pay 1K (!!!) yearly to be able to create notes at all. 10+ year user leaving"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite note taking app. Now it's useless as I can't add to my notebooks or create new notes. Not worth paying a yearly sub of $130 either"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It does not enable annotation of existing pdf file notes using a stylus on Samsung tablets"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for 6 years before there latest forced price hike. Switching now, the price is ridiculous for a note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For however many years every time I open this app I've had to X out of the pop-up ad to pay for its subscriptions for features I wouldn't use. Today was the first day it wouldn't allow me to add a new note without paying. I continued using this app because I'd had so many notes in it I referred to. Not anymore. I'm frustrated and done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using it since 2014...but with the nuke dropped on free users that limits to only 50 notes, I'll have to move to something else. Thanks for letting me never make a note again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for years and every update made it worse. I was able to use this app freely until it forced me to disconnect from my laptop twice (on Web and in the Evernote client), then restricted me from making more notes unless I made a subscription. I have to pay to make 1 notebook and 50 notes, and while I've made nowhere near that much content in the last month, it still blocks me. It doesn't even give me the option to export my notes. I'm done with this product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Info was stolen by someone over seas, then they tried to force me to buy a membership to even remotely do something about it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Used it on and off for 10+ years, pretty decent features, collaborative editing finally works properly, mostly pretty quick, although switching between notes could be faster, I like stickies on home screen, 4 stars because too many ads for premium ""deals"" that you'll ""never get again"". I would love it if I actually never got them again. 5 stars when these premium ads stop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit is trash.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$15 a month?! Are y'all high? I've had this app for over 5 years and the last 4-6 months have been buggy, not to mention overloaded with popups. Now we're limited to 50 notes? Count me out. I'm done. Maybe I would have paid $2-3/month, but not $15! Y'all should have done customer research and surveys to understand our pain points and what kind of subscription we'd be comfortable with. It's obvious you guys are searching for any form of revenue. I'll tell you - this is not the right route."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't deserve even a 1 star rating after this update, goodbye evernote moving to microsoft and google notes apps. After years of using this app, it is now giving me 50 notes for 130 dollars looool. You'd radher change the new boss"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Publisher uses overbearing nag screens with annoying confirmations to make it hard to use without upgrading. Paid subscription prices are ridiculous for a notes app. Publisher keeps changing terms for free version. I will be removing my notes and deleting this app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awesome app getting killed by their policies. Using this app over 10 years am moving to another app due to its exorbitant subscription fees...like for real? Thanks Evernote during all these years. I would be keen to pay onetime fee but it looks like there's too much load on Evernote servers so am off. Cheers!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"fed up with app constantly trying to get you to pay extortionate prices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"RIP Evernote. I have used this app for years to write song lyrics, make lists, and jot down notes, so I have hundreds of notes. This has been my go-to app for years, but not anymore. They've recently implemented a ~$15 a month subscription if you want any more than 50 notes. I understand revenue is necessary to keep an app running, but this is egregiously high price point for a glorified note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow, full of ads, buggy, unfriendly, expensive, does not work on Linux, consumes all resources on windows, hangs, unresponsive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for five years and it's been wonderful. I used it everyday for school, personal projects, and just everyday notes. I have over 600+ notes and 30 something notebooks. Then the other day when I logged in, it told me I had to upgrade and pay stupid amounts of money to have more than one notebook and more than 50 notes. This is ridiculous. I'm 16 and unemployed, there's no way I'm paying $130 a year or whatever it was just for that. I'm switching to a different app ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2012 and I'm extremely disappointed with the new limits for the free version that are introduced as a way to force users to pay to be able to use the app. It is useless for me now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The last update has now cripled the free service to 50 notes. This is quite useless now, uninstalled"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"December 2023: Limiting the app to only 50 notes? A decision that absurd almost defies belief. For anyone who's been using the app for any length of time, 50 notes came and went years ago. This update is a blatant and greed-motivated gun to every customer's head, saying ""You want to keep your years of data? Pay up."" Absolutely unbelievable. If anyone does pay, it'll only be for long enough to copy their data off of Evernote and find another permanent replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is garbage. My limit is 50 notes. I've only used 15 and will not let me add more saying I reached my limit. Deleted notes when it upgraded that I could never get back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years before the 'upgrade.' I loved the way it saved my notes online (helpful when my phone crashed last year) and it was useful having everything in one place. As of Dec 4 2023, this app is useless unless you pay a monthly or yearly fee. Technically there is a 'free tier' but I was forced to delete hundreds of notes to qualify and somehow I STILL can't add new content. I'm really disappointed. Frankly, I can get all the paid features on other apps. Bye, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Congratulations - by trying to strong arm users into paying over $100/year for your app, you have ensured that I will never use it again. Well done...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHY would you restrict the free members to literally ONE notebook and 50 notes???? I have been using this app since 2013... Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used for many years. The price increase is ridiculous. I love this app but not sure if the price makes it worth keeping."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like many other users, I opened the app recently to find that I can no longer create a new note or anything else unless I subscribe to a paid plan. Limiting users to one notebook with 50 notes on the free plan is incredibly ridiculous. I decided I didn't want to use Evernote anymore and attempted to permanently delete my account. Unfortunately, now I've been running into serious issues with that also. I used to like Evernote but all this has left me very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like so many others, my 10yrs with Evernote is over. I understand that they need money to operate but the offer is too expensive and there are better, cheaper alternatives. I've been using it less and less but the current restrictions of only 50 notes ends it for me. So long Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"great at first, but now requires a subscription to make more notes and to have one notebook and 50 notes when I already have 6 notebooks.. Moving on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to give 50 notes for free. Now, I'm trying to create a new note having only 29 and it doesn't allow me. They should respect their minimum offered."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I gave this app 5 stars in the past , and now I'm deciding to give them 1 star because of their sudden change to limit me on only 50 notes & force me to pay for a subscription plan ! i will be migrating to google keep or onenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"If you buy a real pocket notebook, it can run you probably 6-15 bucks depending on quality and will last you several decades. I'm not paying 120 a year for a cloud synced notepad. Sorry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Way to tank an og legend. I hope you guys all get fired and the company folds. Enjoy your pages of 1 star reviews, you deserve it. Literally no one is gonna pay you. As my dad used to say, you made your bed, now lay in it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great app. Over last few years have added features that casual users would never have requirements for. You can now only have 50 notes as a maximum unless you pay £80+/year. The shared/group note taking app is glitchy and just doesn't work (simple stuff like a household shared shopping list). Recently have also had the issue of notes made on phone not saving correctly then checking on another device overwrites and deletes days worth of teaching notes. Don't bother, find another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Starting Dec 2023, Evernote decided to make you fund their storage costs beyond 50 notes. Stated it won't impact many users but I've been on this app for 8+ yrs and use it multiple times/wk. Disgusted by being blind sided and will forever associate your brand w being ""cheap"". Data storage costs next to nothing for text based notes, you could have raised funding in other ways than shoving people out the door! Look elsewhere fellow note takers!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After many years, I am looking for an exit and migration strategy due the recent changes in the free tier. 50 notes and one notebook, I already have much more..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2010, I love this app. But this app become really slow. Now this app limit me to 50 notes and ask expensive cost for me to continue use this app. Thank you for the productivity since 2010. I think its a goodbye for now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No better than the other apps. Plus tdmhey keep forcing their priced plans!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it is good as I can login with my email. the downside is there's a limit to the number of notes I can store and it always spam me with advertisement to subscribe. I realise the loading may take long for old notes and sometimes my pictures will go missing. please update your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"No text"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really liked this app until the last few months, keeps freezing so basically useless at present, price went up & service down, it's why I've been using the free version lately, thinks it's time to just find another platform that's functions on Android"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They are not even allowing free users to create a new note! Lol..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Formerly a great app, but now wants $129.99/year (or spams a discount offer constantly) for the privelege of having more than 1 notebook or 50 notes. I will be finding alternatives for my songwriting musings as soon as I can. Signed, a 10+ year user. No longer recommend to anybody."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had used this app for just over 10 years and now after I have 6 or 7 note books and over 200 notes of poems and log in info they made it where you only have one note book and 50 notes, unless you pay over $120 for a year or amost $20 a month....time for a new note, just hope I can get all my poems and stuff copied and moved to a new none now rip-off app....use to be 5 stars now I wouldn't even give it one if I could."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years for taking notes on-the-go between desktop and mobile, but the mobile versions are getting more buggy each year. For example, selecting chunks of text is a nightmare as the highlighter stops dragging along mid-text."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hilarious. Very funny. They butchered their product to now have pop-up ads and demand payment if you want more than 50 notes or 1 notebook. After over 10 years using Evernote, I've moved to LogSeq but I would also recommend Joplin. I don't know why I ever bothered using this ever-increasing garbage of a service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App was good when i installed it 10 yrs ago. Now they try to hold your notes hostage and limit to 50 notes unless you pay i would be happy to pay but price is way too exoensive for such a basic app. Apps is slow. There is no ability to bulk select to delete old notes from the lost view. Much better options out there. Need to export my notes as I am done with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Had audio ideas from 2015 and they are still there after signing in after almost a decade. Wow great company."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have stored notes on this app for years, but now it wants me to pay to move and add new notes. Not happy. I am looking for a new app to use. Unfortunate that I have to waste time manually moving to a new app, especially at the busiest time of the year. Hopefully I can find something that allows me to share my notes with others. Evernote never offended that feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: 12-13-2023 Now, I'm losing whole notes. Gone! Page's are blank! When I try to read my latest note, I discover it's gone. The title is there, but nothing else. I'm so sick of this. I've had a paid account for 10+ years. I'm in the process of transferring all my notes back over to One Note. Thank goodness someone made an app. that does this. I have thousands of notes, patterns, journal writings......10+ years worth March 2023: Don't you guys do a test run before you release your updates?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"my notes are not available"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for over 10 years and now I quit since it is limiting the number of notes I can have. It's too bad the developers decided to do this as I've promoted Evernote to my friends in the past due to it's ease of use. Not paying for something I can get for free elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favourite notetaking app and I've used it for years, even paying for a subscription at times. However they've recently installed a paywall that means that the free version is basically unusable - only 50 notes and one notebook - and the subscription prices have tripled from where they used to be. Suffice to say, I will be looking for another notetaking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Epix app!!! Until they added a subscription and limit of notes to 50, and only 1 notebook! I've been using this app since 2017, and I have over one thousand notes; how am I supposed to save those now? If the free version is so limited. I don't recommend!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As with the other recent reviewers, I've used Evernote for many years on and off, and though there have been minor lags and bugs I was mostly satisfied. However, in the past year or so the quality of the app dropped, my account somehow got hacked (ironically paywall spamming means multiple accounts cant access so they only deleted one note before getting kicked out), constant spamming, and now they've set a limit to the notes, making the app useless for me. Will switch to an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keeps nagging me about ads, free version only lets you make 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They took away the feature I rely on most. Now I have to go back to endlessly long documents with headings instead of notes inside notebooks inside stacks. I'm deleting it and never coming back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free trial is gone all money money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for over 🔟 years and it was very useful, but now they are greedy, can use a few files 📂 on only 2 devices, unless you pay a high subscription fee forever, but without paying, it's not much use. Lots of spamming and pppups, new forced version has a lot of clutter on the screen, again, unless you pay to customise it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for 10 years as a place for digital notes that I wanted to be kept more safely and securely than other platforms. The mobile version isn't great at text editing (extra words get deleted, tables don't work well, etc etc) but I've stuck with it. Well, apparently now if I want to make more than 50 notes in one year I have to pay $130 per year. I'd pay max $15 per year for that. Guess I'll download a decade of notes and move them somewhere else. 👋 Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for probably a decade, and it's been pretty useful - until now. The past 1-2 years it's declined; UI became difficult to navigate and ""features"" were cumbersome.Today I find limitations (free acct) of 1 notebook and 50 notes. Okay, but it won't allow moving notes into 1 notebook, and deleting took multiple attempts. It took 90 min to do tasks that should have been simple and easy. Altho I deleted all but 20 notes, it's still locked to anything new. Bye Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have 50 notes limit for me, I have 1 star limit for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Save your time and go elsewhere. Other than the very basic ability to take notes, nothing other than that ever worked for me. Now they won't even allow you to make any new notes unless you buy their subscription. Great job of alienating all your users!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for >10 years only to learn this week that I am no longer able to add any new files or folders without paying over a $100 a year. No consideration for a long-term user - No grandfathering in, no longer just a monthly limit on uploads/new files. And given all the glitches and issues with performance following recent updates (tolerable when free), there's no way I'm paying that kind of monthly fee. As annoying as it will be to move all my files, I will be doing just that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to like it since 2012 but the past 2 years spamming to force buying the upgrade at the app opening and finally blocking the free version to maximum 50 notes and 1 notebook made me give up. I moved to an other app having both a good free version and a cheaper full version if needed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I had this app so long I don't even think Android was a thing. I'm taking 15+ years. It used to be great, handy and convenient. Now, every time you open the app, it asks you for an upgrade. If I didn't get the paid version for 15 years, what makes you think I'll change my mind? The app needs a decline forever option. Especially since suddenly you can only have 50 notes. The developers are either going broke or have bowed to the Gods of consumerism so hard they can't see the forest for the trees."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2013. 10 years I've used this app. Solely for taking notes. Almost 1000 notes. Now you want to charge me at least $18 a month to keep making notes? Maybe I would've considered $5 a month. Maybe $8 at a stretch just for old times sake. But to ransom me for $18 a month just to keep taking notes? That's just greedy. I have no need of anything else you have to offer except for taking notes. Why not have a basic option for people like me? I'll be uninstalling once I've found an alternative. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant even disconect device to open my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have always loved Evernote until now...I have 42 notes ...it says I can have up to 50 without paying for the extra package. But it wouldn't let me add any new notes. Guess I'll be deleting this app. Very disappointing that everyone is so greedy. I'll buy a freaking paper notebook before I'll pay $115 a year or $15 a month for a note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In a course of a year they've over doubled the cost to use the premium service ($14.99 a month for a notebook, are you kidding? I used to pay $35 a year for this) and have cut the free membership to 50 notes and 1 notebook. There are much better services out there. Use them instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nah, far too expensive for more than 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well if you've been looking at the reviews you know what I'm about to say. I loved this app, genuinely the best notebook app out there. Unfortunately they have decided to add absolutely ridiculous prices just to take notes in a free app. I'm not even at the limit and it's still making me upgrade. A huge disappointment. It's sad we can't have nice things anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This once was a very good app. Then overnight it went to trash with a demand for payment to continue to use the app how I have been using it. Looking for replacement app now. Legacy user gone... on principle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great app that I have used for ages but has gone down hill since charging users money. $160 for one year? RIP Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly sucks, il be exporting all my notes asap. Edit: I have exported everything using Evernote to one drive exporter and will not be returning after all the ridiculous restrictions for the free app. See ya!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Love the app sad won't be able to use it again. Don't know who has $14.99 a month for a note app. I would have done a $1 a month"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this for years have thousands of notes across several notebooks but now they've made it so you can only have 1 notebook with 50 entries or I gotta cough up 150 bucks a year. Nice business practice.. not looking forward to the arduous task of transferring notes to a different platform..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app just doesn't allow me to make any new notes anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Perfect example of greedy developers. $130 a year if you want more than 50 notes is a complete joke when there are so many alternatives out there. I'm in the process of exporting my notes and deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I got it as it seemed like a great alternative to other choices at the time. I'm now being hit with a ""upgrade your plan to use more than 1 notebook and 50 notes"" page whenever I try to move my notes around - as I already have 3 notebooks. If you're going to scale pricing for your app, restricting what the user can already do is a disingenuous marketing technique and I will now find a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've attempted to use this app for years. I'm done. Too few devices allowed. Constant re-logging in required. And they want over $100.00 a year to use this garbage. I tried. I gave you a chance. GO BROKE !!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote user since 2013. Can no longer justify trusting this company with my data. Evernote has a long-term pattern of putting the squeeze on its user base, disabling critical features and increasing prices to frankly ridiculous levels. At this point, I feel Evernote is a sinking ship and I don't want to risk losing everything if it finally collapses in on itself. Will be moving on to greener pastures."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for almost a decade and I loved it. I would have been happy to spend $10 or even $20 for a one-time upgrade to a paid version, but without warning they are asking $130 / year for a subscription if I want to create any new notes, which is ridiculous. Especially because there have been noticeable glitches recently, especially with edits on the mobile app not saving. Time to switch to OneNote, which I get for free with my company's Microsoft 365 plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't even try to use the free service!!!!!!!!!! It's not even worth it. I was a 10 year user, but the constant upgrade requests & changes made it difficult to use Evernote. Go find a better note taking app on here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After 10 years, I can finally say goodbye to Evernote. They never made significant updates; the app and its interface remain the same as when I started using it. It changes from portrait to horizontal view, and there's no way to lock that. It charges double the amount of free apps with the same functionalities, which, by the way, allow a one-time payment. Overall, not recommended. I wonder how many of us just use it out of nostalgia. It was mildly good while it lasted. Thanks anyway, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thanks for the recent update! Now I can't add new notes because it has exceeded the maximum notes allowed (with no warning). Now I can delete it and look for something else! Thanks, you greedy bastards"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait and switch. Been using Evernote for years and now they want us to pay to have more than 50 notes. LOL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this app for many, many years, I am suddenly severely limited unless I subscribe? Rule number one in introducing a paid model, don't lock away functionality that was already there. Offer new functionality. This is a shameless cash grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user for 10 years. Works great, but they are SO pushy with upgrades. And now they are not honoring their 50-note limit on the free plan, instead cutting me off at 40, and there is NO support staff. No thanks, it has totally soured my opinion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do believe you guys are progressively limiting features in the hopes of getting people to subscribe. I recently got the ""you're limited to 50 notes"" notification. That's new, especially since I'm way over that limit. Dropping that limit to force subscriptions is about as unethical as it gets. I'll be transferring my notes off Evernote, and deleting the application. Beware this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for over a decade now and received a notification today that I have exceeded my free limit of 50 notes and 1 notebook. I have hundreds of notes organized into dozens of notebooks currently. It seems like the Evernote devs are attempting to actively sabotage their own product. A subscription for a digital notebook is insane. I'd pay a one time flat rate, but not monthly. There is not enough space on here to air all grievances, but suffice to say I'll be moving elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As many other reviews have already stated, my review is now 1 star due to them changing limit to 50 notes. Over a $100/yr subscription for a note taking app, see you later Evernote. I would've even paid a reasonable fee, but now you lost another one. UpNote is an awesome Evernote replacement at a reasonable price. Also includes ability to import Evernote notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version now unusable with the amount of ads that pop up, I get that apps shouldn't always be free but there is no way I'm spending $130 for the ability to take decent notes. Ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's rather finicky, with often weird and unexpected behavior. Lately we've gotten more features, which the app was in dire need of. Due to severe performance issues on flagship phones, the app is just barely a viable option due to being free. Edit: You changing the note limit to 50, which put me 30 notes over the limit, was exactly the kick in the ***** I needed to finally migrate over to OneNote. Thank you for making the decision easier!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a joke, right? $130 bucks a year so I can make some notes? I like the organization system but not THAT much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app went from being bad at syncing across devices to spamming too many ""do you want premium"" notifications to ""you can only have 1 notebook with 50 notes"". I greatly appreciated these services when they were good but there are better options for note taking apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"12/12/23 update Uninstalling today! LMAO you idiots // Several times a day a pop up asksme for money for the full version, every time I say No, it says ""oh, but you'll N e v e r see this offer again!"" But I see it several times a day, and I will eventually stop using this app because of it. It's impossible not to know about this option after being annoyed about it a hundred times, of course if I ever wanted it, I would initiate that of my own accord. And I may well have but never will now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy greedy greedy! New subscription model at frankly OUTRAGEOUS prices makes what used to be the best synched note taking app in the world absolutely unusable unless you're willing to shill out 100€ a year! Perhaps I would have considered it if this change didn't feel like such a betrayal and shameless cash grab. Genuinely don't think a reduced price would change my mind at this point. This change has completely destroyed my positive perception of and goodwill toward this brand. I'm furious."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Now with its forced subscription model, gotta say there isn't a lot that warrants payment. Definitely skip"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Makes me feel like I've stepped into the smart-phone age finally. This is exactly what I've been needing for years. Thank you! Edit (12/12/23): Changing this review from a 5 star to a 2 star. I am now unable to add any more notes as I've reached the new 50 note limit. Reminders are very inconsistent now. Constant pop-ups to upgrade the service. I'll be deleting this app shortly once I copy over my existing notes. Extremely disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything was perfect and it was one of the best note organizer we could use. Now, with the 50 notes limit, it just makes me want to never use it again. It lost it's complete purpose and now I just use something else. This company is not reliable after trying to make money out of virtual paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only have 27 notes, but it's making me upgrade because the free plan is limited to 50 notes. Umm, 27 is less than 50! Fix the bug, and scale back the greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't access my old note/documents without going to premium version ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The decision to limit the number of notes & notebooks to older/longtime users is a poor one. I've enjoyed the app thoroughly, even with the previous restrictions. But this is takes the cake of poor decisions. I understand the need to earn a bottom line to keep the app & service running. But further limiting what is essentially a solitary experience with a gross service fee has convinced me to find a new notes service. (also, the share feedback button doesn't work. I wonder why...)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: I had previously held Evernote in high regard for its simple UI and organization, but with every update it's clear the new profit models have made things progressively worse for the existing userbase and almost impossible for new members. Once again, the decision to compartmentalize and limit the core features of Evernote (messaging other users, sharing, offline access to notes, and multi-device use, and notebooks) to separate packages has downgraded the Evernote experience for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2014. As of this month they require $130/year to add notes to the service. What a joke. Deleting my account and switching to a alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super like ❤️ 🌹"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly I can't use basic note with the free plan anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've only made 22 notes, won't let me create a new one, it says I have to upgrade? Yet, it also says I can have up to 50 notes on the basic. 🤔 The app doesn't stand out that much compared to competitors to be paying the price asked for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for many years, but was practically forced today to use paid version, $130 / year, since I reached a new ""limit"" they just created. 50 notes limit! I already had over 1000 notes. I guess I'll lose all my notes but no way I'm paying $130for this. I'll just use Google docs for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my goto notes organiser. Stopped using as too expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They suddenly made it so free users can only have 50 notes and one notebook. I have been using Evernote for YEARS to organize things like D&D campaigns, schoolwork, task lists, craft ideas, and more. Significantly more than 50 notes and one notebook. Now I have to switch because I can't afford a subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Subscription charges are very high"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting from bad to worse. Constant pop ups asking you to pay, shared notes not showing latest content etc. It's buggy as hell and they still have the cheek to charge a king's ransom for it. Rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updating my Evernote review: constantly crashes, constantly loses my work. It's not okay to crash all the time. Every time I use it, I have to copy my work because eight times out of ten, Evernote crashes. What did the devs do to it? Also 50 notes? You're kidding. Time to go."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is the worst I already started transitioning to another notes app months ago because of all the problems Evernote has in the app. It is just annoying. But now after using it for years I can't create any new notes more than 50 or I have to pay over 100 a year?? This is it. I will transfer all my data out of it and delete my account. This is just burglary what Evernote does. Goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting 1 notebook & 50 notes, What the hell is this? Ever note getting worst with each update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for over a decade & now the new structure doesn't allow me to create any new notes. Now in the process of finding an alternative app and migrating my notes across."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"While there can certainly be a lot of use cases, mandatory(!) account creation for a note-taking app is definitely not necessary."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using it for 10+ years, storing countless ideas and notes, they've now limited free accounts to 50 notes without notice. It's a letdown for us long-term users who've seen it as more than just an app, but a part of our daily routine 🙄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$129 to just take notes? Not happening! I have been a free user for 12 years. It came with the phone. Run ads. Do something else. $129 for just notes. I'm definitely looking elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just ruined a great app I've been using for 7 years. I have more than 1000 notes and now I'm not allowed to create anymore without paying. Good news is, I can just move to a different note app, and I encourage everyone else do the same."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app for keeping notes but it's really gone downhill in the last few months. It constantly keeps asking me to upgrade my account and now there is a limit to how many totes and notebooks you can have. The app also has a lot of bugs now, most of the time when I tap on a note it doesn't load and I have to go back and tap on the note again and it loads then. Also, when I go back out of a note, the app closes rather than going back to the main menu."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"At first, 10 years ago, a good experience. Cross-Device sync, easy to handle. Today, it's obvious the developer isn't making enough cash, massive in-app advertising for the pro version. Now, after having created more than 800 free notes, suddenly the free plan is reduced to 50 notes, impossible to create new ones. Why I will not pay for the pro version? Formatting is not working properly, text gets lost and sync issues happen all the time. Questionable reliability. So: Google Keep. Sadly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love the app, now it simply just sucks.. for real?? you have to pay to make notes? Well, I refuse to pay. I used this app since it was created first time. it used to be amazing.. but now? now is just garbage..hackers hacking my account every week or so, limitated notes to 50 only. BS!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote for around 10 years. With this new update, I can not continue using it without subscribing. Thank you for being my companion for years, but it's time to find another app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HORRIBLE! I've been using this app for years now and suddenly I have to PAY to be able to make more notebooks and notes??? In a notes app? DONT GET IT!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Apparently, I have to cough up £80 a year to write unlimited notes now. Who comes up with these prices? £10 I'd pay at most. I've already moved to a different notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Telling me that I've reached my limit of notes, which states 50 when I'm only at 30 is ridiculous. I refuse to pay and this app has progressively become worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version is junk. Don't waste your time. Its just a constant advertisement to get you to spend money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be a good app, i had hundreds of notes, now you can only make 50 notes max and then must pay a LOT/year.. for a note taking app. will change rating if fixed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Years of use, insane to think it's valued high enough for a monthly subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I went with the free version and then they sprung the new version on me with limited notes and notebooks creations. I'm in the process and looking into alternatives after 5 years of using Evernote and putting up with their annoying price pop-opps. Looking into Joplin, Obisdian, Notion, etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They need money only. No proper sync, I lost all images related to my surgery. Now they allow only 50 notes. Bye bye evernote 👋🏻"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It was a nice ride, had this for many years but recent pushes for money has drove me off, the app is pretty reliable for notes for sure but price is just a bit out of what I'd pay for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The auto feature in photo taking goes into an endless loop - it has been that way for a while, making the app useless for recognising business cards. Please fix this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used free app for 12 years. Now a bait and switch with a pricey subscription rate and a limit of 50 notes for the free version. I'll have to look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be a good app, but they keep raising the price, doing all they can to make the free version less appealing, and cutting back on the features. There are a lot of note taking apps out there they are free or really cheap, and which have more functionality then even evernote's most premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They keep moving features behind a HUGE paywall. My 300 notes USED TO be organized. I don't even know if paying the $130/year would put them back in my categories/notebooks. Also, some stuff hasn't saved and some saved notes have suddenly become blank."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They raised prices, I went back to free after 8 years of paying, and now the app crashes after multiple reinstallations."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gonna be moving to new app, after new update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can yall flop that fast?? Went from being one of the best note apps to absolutely terrible.. how sad :c"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic move from Evernote. 50 notes limit. Seriously? Used to love this over other notes but now it's completely unusable. 450 per month is a ridiculous ripoff for using personal notes. Annoyed with the upgrade popups every single time I open the note. Everyone should uninstall this & find alternatives. Bye bye money monger!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 notebook 50 notes limit made this unusable. Use since 2009, uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely appalling. Used this app for 6 years and I've done thousands of songwriting notes for free. Now they've changed it so I can't create more than 50 without upgrade. Scumbags"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today, Evernote introduced a maximum number of notes (50) you can take on the free plan. I had almost 100 notes. So I deleted old notes (and then emptied the trash). I now have only 30 notes. The app STILL won't let me make a new note. Every time I try to, the app tells me I can only take 50 notes on my plan and now I have to upgrade. Why have a free plan at all if you only intend to screw over the app users? At least be honest and say you want to abolish the free plan!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version not worth it. Lost my trust."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote for 10+ years and today they are ridiculously trying to charge people money...for notes. Jesus Christ I could get a leather notebook and it will last years. It won't cost as much as the crazy charges. Biggest L. Im going with another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I selected all of the content in a note, clicked ""copy"" and everything disappeared. The undo button didn't work, and selecting ""paste"" did nothing. Even going to another application and trying to paste from the clipboard didn't work. I tried customer support, and it turns out I need to subscribe to premium to even email support! This was really important information that I completely lost because of this junk app. This same issue has happened multiple times to me, I assumed it was me till this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"An updated nite extraction would awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So disappointed in the changes to the free version. All notebooks I previously created count as over my limit, but I can't move items from there to the default notebook, even though i reduced my notes to within the 50(?!?!) limit. I can't delete the default notebook either. So how can I actually handle the notes I have left if I can't move them? Plus, as other reviews have noted, the new 50limit is absurd. This is no longer viable as a free app. I shall copy all to a new app and start over."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote and have used it for years. I have almost 800 notes. I have noticed in the last few months that the app's performance has gotten worse, for example I can't access the notes at first try, on top of that today I get the message that the maximum for the free plan is 50 notes? REALLY??? after endless requests to pay for a subscription you are practically forcing me to pay but don't you worry, as soon as I find a valid alternative that's goodbye forever. Shame on you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now it's just terrible. Every new feature makes it harder to use and the incessant ads are a dealbreaker. Especially when the ads pop up right when I'm trying to quickly enter something before I forget it. Enough of this nonsense. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for many years. Last update is a huge downgrade. UX is terrible, app starts up in 30 seconds. New note lags for 20 seconds until you can even start typing or fails to open whatsoever until you hard kill the app. Why would anyone do this to a great app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was fine until it decided I'd reached my limit and wanted to start charging, even though I only have 10 notes on my phone. I'll be finding an alternative and unimstalling Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app. I've used it for years, maybe a decade. In an effort to milk every last penny out of their userbase the app has decided to limit ""free users"" to 50 notes and 1 notebook (what they call a folder). Given that I've used the app for so long, I'm well over that. The app has essentially become a brick for me. I'll have to migrate my notes to another app & uninstall. The end of an era."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Newly ambushed (no warning) with $135 / yr ~ whether the app is useful for not I am canceling on principle. Whether or not they offer a lower subscription price for the following year, I cancel on principle. I'm saddled with the cost for a year though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but I'm deleting it now. The app and features are not worth what they're asking for a monthly fee and the number of glitches I've encountered as turned me off. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently went to add a note, got blocked and said I need to upgrade to have more than 50 notes. You are now limited to 50 notes unless you pay. Safe to say I need to find a new note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recently discovered some unknown login to my account. Had to delete the entire account as I couldn't connect to support. This is really worring"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app since 2015 and it used to be great, my holy Grail, but it keeps getting more EXCLUSIVE and more EXPENSIVE. I LITERALLY CANNOT DO ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE WITHIN THE APP NOW! Some of the features they bug you repeatedly to pay for are purely cosmetic and useless anyway. Stick with Google Docs or something instead. I'm getting rid of this. Tired of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review 12.11.23 This app is still awful. Now they won't allow me to use the service I've been using since 2016. They want $130 so I can access the same $hit I've been using for free😂 nah, that's a hard no for me. Constant issues and glitches As a visiting nurse I need a note taking application that is reliable and this is certainly not it. I've been using this for years and it seems every year it gets worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2013. Unfortunately this morning, I went into the app to make a new note & found out I needed to upgrade because I'm on the free version that only allows 1 notebook & 50 notes. Well, I currently have over 400 notes & many many notebooks. What the heck? Then on top of it, if you don't want to pay the $129.99 a year for the premium version, it's $14.99/month. It's absolutely not affordable & it's ridiculous they changed it. So I downloaded a new note app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this for years. I've had many notebooks in the app and many notes in each notebook, but now they're saying I can only have 1 notebook with 50 notes max, or I can pay them $130.00 to do what I can do for 0.99 cents with a piece of paper. This is a mistake on their part and I'm sure they'll see that soon enough. YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST RUN MORE ADS, DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK ANYONE IS GOING TO PAY OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR YOUR SERVICE? CRAZY GREEDY. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great 10 years ago. Now it's slow to open and move use. On top of that I get spammed to buy the premium plan from which I opted out dozens of times every time I open the app. Will migrate all my notes to another app soon and uninstall this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've Been using this App for 7 years, and now I'm being forced to upgrade? I'm now limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook. Guys if you want to charge . . . then charge the new guys . . . not the people that already have established accounts"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Highly disappointed... I've had this app since 2014. I recommended it to everyone. I have 1,998 notes created. I have 126 notebooks created. I'm now told that the new limit is 1 notebook and 50 notes, and that I am no longer able to create anything more. I guess I'm done with this app. After 9 years and 1 month, I'll be looking for a new note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has been my go-to note taking app for about 12 years. I love it. Went to make a new note today and BAM! - not allowed to make anymore notes until I subscribe. I'll be finding a different solution."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow and limited to only 50 notes, stay away from this garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forced upgrade to a paid version. Uninstalled and used the free Google Keep or Samsung Note apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Seriously... 99/year is steep. Bye, it could have been love."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's sudden and undisclosed restriction on the Free plan – limiting me to 1 notebook and 50 notes after years of use – was a complete letdown. The lack of transparency about these limitations in their pricing or terms is unacceptable. As a long-time user, feeling blindsided by such a change was disappointing. Consequently, I've switched to MS OneNote, seeking a more upfront and reliable note-taking experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm a student and I've been using this to organize my notes and share my notes with other people. It's a great app—last year, that is. I hate it when I have limited freedom to do anything because you need to subscribe to this and that. I don't have money, and my parents are strict about it. Please just add ads for free-subscription users, and make it so that you have to subscribe to remove ads. I don't care if it's annoying, just as long as I can create unlimited notes and notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently this developer very bravely shot themselves in both feet and tried to run a marathon. A 50 note limit, restricting free users to a single notebook is such a slap in the face. It's been a lifetime since I've hoped a company goes under, so please understand when I say that, from the bottom of my heart I hope this company crashes, it comes from a deep untapped well of negative emotion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have just limites to 50 notes. It used to be unlimeted. Why would i want to pay for notes when there are so many free ways of making online notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had Evernote for years and loved it. Tried to open a new note today and apparently I can't do that anymore unless I pay for the premium subscription. Now you're limited to 50 notes and one notebook, when it used to be unlimited for both. It's not enough to be constantly spammed with ads to upgrade to premium, now I'm being forced to? Time to find a new app, I guess. Disappointing, since this was by far my preferred note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for 10years and I've learnt to put up with the bugs and crashes, as well as the constant ""suggestions"" to upgrade but limiting new notes in an attempt to push me towards subscribing is pathetic. I even cleared a bunch of notes to get to below the new minimum of 50 notes but it seems to be based on how many you've created, not how many you have, it's ridiculous. I'm done with Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Are you serious? I paid for premium for so many years, but now you have increased the price more than 200%, how much crazy is that?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app became almost unusable after the huge UI overhaul a few months ago. Ever since the developers have been demanding money every time I open the app. To pay $129/yr(!!!!) for a NOTES APP is ridiculous, let alone one that crashes, freezes, and bugs EVERY TIME ITS USED. These massive updates were not needed nor asked for. The constant ads for the premium plan are incredibly obnoxious and often VERY MISLEADING, trying to TRICK YOU into clicking accept on the payment plan. Dishonest!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update kills Evernote free. I'll be moving to obsidian. I've used Evernote for over a decade, but theres no paid plan less than $130 a year and now you can't really use it for free. old 5 star review: Incredibly well done and useful. Evernote Co. is dedicated to one thing, and they do it well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1. 10yr user, with over 4k notes. 2. App has become SLOW; each note takes forever to open, if at all. 3. Some new changes are awful: back button now exits app instead of going to previous page; feedback button doesnt work; need to pay to email notes now & it limits search results of your own notes unless you upgrade. 4. Everything is clunky, finicky and takes forever to do. AND I've now reached my note limit and cant make any more without paying for an annual plan! I've now switched to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not worth anymore. Theyare asking for upgrade and their upgrade plans are not worth for me. Will migrate to one note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dropping rating to one star after using the app as my only note-taking app for the last 7 years. It is ridiculous to expect users to pay up to $15 a month for what used to be a free app. And then to limit the free version to only 50 usable notes? Evernote app is totally unusable now, unless you're willing to pay absurd rates. Plenty of other free note-taking apps out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well I guess I won't be using this anymore due to price restrictions. It sucks that something that's worked for the last 8 years just fine is now limited to 50 notes and one notebook. I can deal with the constant badgering for my money everytime I use it but maybe some of us can't afford to pay for premium. Thanks alot for this ruination of the best writing app I've ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's been my most precious note keeper for 6 years. But now that they updated it's horrible. It takes forever to load or upload. The set up of notes is annoying. The auto rotate is awful. And it's constantly not saving notes properly with just data so I have to retype it if I'm not contacted to WiFi. . .12/11/23 I've used this app for free forever and now they are trying to force to me to pay $130 a year for a notes app if I want to have more than 50 notes? That's ridiculous! Greedy Capitalist!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"some features disappeared, Like tabs. Cannot fully edit notes. Update: free users have limit on notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They find a way to make the basic functionality worse every year, and now they gutted the free plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has been getting progressively worse, and the latest update is the final straw for me. I will be backing up my notes elsewhere, and getting rid of my EN account. Good luck, I think you'll be losing a lot of users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for so many years, I don't even know how many notes I have. That is how often I use it. Unfortunately, things have gotten worse over time. At first, the app kept logging me out.. I stayed, and eventually, it was fixed. Then, recently, it kept crashing on me. I would open an app, and it never would load. When I logged out, it just crashed.. I still stayed. Now, what has finally pushed me to leave is the fact that we are being forced to pay. Guess its time to find a new app.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"really expensive cost"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I only have 28 notes, but the app is claiming I've already hit my limit of 50?? Wow. So how can I be sure that if I started a subscription, I'll be getting what I paid for, since apparently the app doesn't even know how to count?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"And now they are forcing users to ""upgrade"" to their premium product that is not free or you are limited to 50 notes. Time to find another product since there are plenty of other ones out there. Plus I never liked the fact that they don't provide any way that I can decipher to print a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since August of 2021. It was fine, easy to use, and accessible. As of December 4th, 2023, capitalist greed has overtaken this app. Now, if you want more than 50 separate notes or separate notebooks, you're FORCED to pay a minimum of $129.99 a year. I used to use this app, not anymore. I am uninstalling this once I transfer all my notes somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$129 a year to write down notes lolololol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updates have killed this app. More and more functionality is moved behind a paywall leaving the free version unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many adds. Plans ridiculously expebsive. App not smooth due to excessive adds for plans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"130.00 a year?!??!!!?! Way too greedy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has begun trying to force people to pay for the app. There's no such thing as a free version now. It's become a trial of 50 notes and then they expect you to pay. It's extremely disappointing. I've used Evernote for years, but now I'm moving on to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for YEARS. Had hundreds of notes on the free version. All of a sudden there is a 50 note limit on the free version. I can't create a new note at all. I'm switching to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update finally killed this app. I've been a power user on Evernote for roughly a decade, but now I am limited to 50 notes and 1 notebook?? I use this app for work, school, personal, medical, side projects, freelance gigs, etc. Now, I either pay a subscription or stop using the app? The best thing about the app was that it was free for taking notes. Goodbye, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"December 2023: App constantly crashing when i attempt to open a note. It's become junkware. What a shame. August 2021: They just can't get their stuff together. The app began crashing at startup. I had to uninstall and reinstall to correct. And the new start page is useless for me, and there doesn't seem to be a way to default the start-up to the notes list. Previous: Have used for many years. Outstanding app has gotten better w recent overhaul (late 2020). Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be very useful, but changes to the free plan make it barely usable and the paid plan is outrageously expensive for personal use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After nearly 8 of using Evernote I have to change my review to one star. The recent limit change on the free plan has made the app completely un-usable. I am not going to be strong armed into paying for something like this. Whatever gambit Evernote is trying shows how terrible of a company they are."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My originally 5 star review had to be amended because of the sudden implementation of a note limit of only 100. Absolutely ridiculous and very sad to see, I had many more than that. I wanted to get a subscription next year but with this unfriendly change to free users I will instead uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Max Notes Reached"" but I only have 12 notes... keeps giving me the same message when I try to create a new note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pick any other notes app. This one has 1000 problems it shouldn't have. Promo banners every time you open it. Backswiping on Android closes the app instead of closing the note to the main page. Notes sometimes don't load or don't save. My keyboard has swipe to backspace and this app deletes a bunch if text AHEAD of my cursor whenever I do that in addition to the text I actually want to delete."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Removed the basic functionality of the free app, and is attempting to force users to paid service, in exchange for offering features which I don't use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've literally been using this app since 2014, and I absolutely loved it until recent years...the constant pushing of the premium upgrade was one thing...but now I think I've officially reached the point where I jump ship...I have hundreds of notes and multiple notebooks and now I can't add any notes unless I pay a monthly fee..thanks for alienating every single one of your long-time users...it's really a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limiting notes on the free app is complete BS..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One star, as the plans are priced outrageously for such a basic app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use any other app than this. I used to love this app, but now it's trash. It says the free app limits you to 50 notes but it won't let me create anything new. I had 8 notes and it wouldn't let me create any more because my limit was reached? So I deleted 4 of them and still it won't let me make a new note. It just keeps trying to charge me $150!!! Like no NOTE app is worth that lol."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Increasingly worse over time! I have used this app for years, but lately the ads are too much. Now I can't create new notes, unless I upgrade, so Evernote can $uck it! I will become familiar with Samsung notes I guess."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"That's it, I'm deleting the app. Today I wasn't able to write new notes on my free account because of a new policy that limits you with only 50 notes trying to push customers to pay for an upgraded plan. Every paid ""premium"" feature on this app used to be free 2 to 3 years ago and ironically the app had almost 0 bugs compared to what we have now. This app had so much potential it's sad to see it become useless and unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Past few months have been annoying with spammed upgrade ads, but now I can't make new notes without upgrading. The suggested price is $130/yr. More than a AAA MMO. Do you really think the value is equivalent?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goodbye. Forever. My free account of 12 years holds 100+ Notebooks & just under 1,000 notes. Now you suddenly want a $130/yr subscription, and have limited me to 1 notebook of 50 notes, max. I would have paid a one-time fee, but you don't get to hold me or my data hostage for a subscription, let alone an excessive one $$$$. We're done, ya greedy idiots."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Quite slow loading of notes recently"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years and watched it get more and more hungry for money while also making the app worse and worse. Now you're limiting notes? Take the hint, when people are leaving your app, it means you messed up! It's time I look for an alternative cuz I can't stand this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love using Evernote - multiple notes, multiple folders, all for free.. Now if I want to add another note, I need to pay £8.99/month.. Funny thing though, they changed this on December 4th but only emailed to let me know on December 10th.. No warning at all.. Disgusting!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for over a decade. Over the years, the app has become more and more predatory. They're pay walling basic functionality. Only one notebook and 50 notes for free? I have over 1290 notes, 9 notebooks, and various task lists. I cannot create new notes or notebooks now. I'm uninstalling. I'd much rather transfer all the information to a new, actually free app. You guys are screwing yourselves. Charge an upfront fee for the app and get over yourselves. G-Suite is free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have neutered this app to drive us to very pricey plans. Every time I open it, it makes me deal with a sales popup that takes two clicks to close. It says I won't be able to get back to the offer, but shows it to me every time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"- new limit to 1 notebook and 50 notes, - a lot of subscription notifications"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a free Evernote user since 2014, and they have steadily removed features from free users, to the point where the app no longer meets my needs. The pricing for the paid plans is absurd. Good thing it was easy to move to Joplin! I won't let the door hit me on the way out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love, but they recently changed so you can only have 1 notebook and 50 notes unless you pay $100+ a year. I will be finding a new solution and deleting my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is this a joke? Limiting down to 50 notes? The app isn't even that great. Alot of times it won't even allow me to copy/cut properly and the note dissapears and I have to undo the editing and try again, sometimes upwards of 3-5 times. And it won't even work properly with other notes. Also had multiple instances of unverified devices. After I've used the app for 5+ years. No I will not upgrade. I'm going to save all my notes elsewhere, and uninstall the app. Thank you very much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just got an email someone from brazil logged into my acçount. My password got compromised. I changed pass and revoked accesses. Theres a data breach happening now. If anyone in evernote reading this, pls take immediate action"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New limit of 50 notes makes this virtually unusable for me now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free plan now are useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free version only allows 50 notes, but then when you delete to be less than 50 notes, it continues to block me from making new notes. Seems like a scam."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Account got hacked from China. No way to contact evernote unless you are a paying member. 2 step verification can't be set up and I can't even contact them to troubleshoot it. Absolute joke of a company. Do not put anything personal in your notes because this App is NOT SAFE! Now evernote have added a 50 note limit which has rendered the app useless. Will be copying and pasting to another app and then deleting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I Moved to UPNOTE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It suddenly cut to 1 notebook and 50 notes total for the free version. Take note of that before you download. I used it for over a decade and now it's limited severely in its functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forcing me to pay. Not allowing me to contact them. I would like to to complain about stopping me from creating notes without any warning or information. This is a key service I use and don't appreciate the way this has been handled. I have been a paying customer and pay when it makes sense for me. Forcing me to pay just to write notes in an app that can barely save files properly, deletes random lines of text and can't do bullet points properly without deleting things is unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't pay anything for saving a note. I'll get another app. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They just gutted the free version to force people to switch to premium. No longer worth using."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have loved this app for years, but the limits that they put on for the free version are ridiculous. I could understand if they added some limitation to the free version, but they shouldn't have basically taken everything away. I had considered upgrading to the paid version before, but I think now I'm just going to look for something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not usually one to write a review, but the recent changes to this app have made it feel necessary. I've used this app for years to jot down notes for anything under the sun. From grocery lists, to gift ideas, to song lyrics I come up with. I open the app to write something down to find that they've made it to were you can only have 1 notebook and 50 notes on the free user plan, and even more ridiculous, is the $130 per year price they put on the premium SUBSCRIPTION."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage. Bait and switch."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Removing 1 star due to agressive pressure to purchase a paid plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just what we needed - being forced to Upgrade. Kindly remove 1 Notebook limitation, Number of notes is understandable but Notebook limitation is absurd."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless, second time i am switching note app, not returning to Evernote ever again, max 50 notes for free?? Ridiculously expensive for only notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad after 2 update..keep showing loading animation..pervious version was very simple to use and search.. please revert to older version. New version are created complex UI. I almost stop using and move to note app. Due old info comeback few times to Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: dropping to 1 star since they're getting greedy and now and constantly add more restrictions and limitations to the free version. annoying that there's no formatting consistency between the desktop version, website, and app. If I create a note using the website, and then continue to edit it on my android, the formatting of the new text changes (size is smaller etc) so I have to go back on the website (using my laptop) to fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using this app for years and years, I am switching note apps. The incessant spamming to buy premium, constant pop-ups every screen change, is absolutely ridiculous. I don't know how anyone is still using this spamware app still. So sad, was once an amazing app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Made it unusable, cost is unreasonable. I had been using this app, and the web version, for years. I'd use it to track habits, plan trips, and for a lot of planning stuff. If you only linked one device in the app, you could still use the website without paying. Recently, the makers made the change that limits the free version to one notebook and 50 notes, making it useless. Unless you pay the unreasonable price of $130/year. Now I've lost years of work. (Sarcastic) thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The upgrade ad followed immediately by another upgrade ad was it for me. I get pushing the paid version, but having to ""I'm sure"" x out multiple times to get to a less functional version isn't worth it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have been using this app since 2017 and was very satisfied the first couple of years. But during the last year the amount of tools I could use as a user with no paid subscription has been drastically reduced. I didn't care as long as I still could create notes. But since yesterday I'm not able to do even that. According to my plan, now I can create a max. of 50 notes and cannot even move them between the existing notebooks. It's just ridiculous. Sadly, I'll have to switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review: I hate how this app gets objectively worse to use and yet they still wanna keep limiting options and charge you more for it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years and loved that I was able to write as many notes as I needed to, and could access them from different devices. Now it's saying I've reached my limit and won't let me create new notes until I pay for an upgrade. As soon as I find a free alternative note app, I'll be deleting this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best and cleanest note keeping app, then you get bombarded with ""Premium"" deals. Finally now they blocked additional notes for free Stay away if you are looking for something good and free. This is gatekeeping garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just don't use it, seriously, it is the worst note taking app out there. Insted of fixing a already messed up app, they start forcing you to buy a plan because free plan becomes limited. Now you have a limit of 50 notes only.... Trust me, you will exceed that eventually, and you have ads every single time on oppening an app. Just don't even consider this app because it seems it will only get worse, and by time you will get to a situation like me where you have to transfer 150 notes somewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for YEARS. Have over 1,200 notes saved on it. Now, all of a sudden, it tells me I've reached my limit (claiming 1 notebook and 50 notes to be the limit) and now I have to pay... $130 per year or $15 each month ($180 per year). Not that I don't understand monetizing your product, the fact I've used it for so long and have so much of my life saved on it and now I'm priced out of using it. The price is extremely high for a notepad app. $5/month, $50/year would be acceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for almost 15 years. Have thousands of notes. Apparently as of today it says I'm limited to 50 free notes as a free user. Not to mention it's been pushing me to upgrade every day for at least a month. So my go to app has ended up being just a money grubbing as every large corporation now and days. After 15 years, I have to abandon it for something else which waits to be seen. Have to research first."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but the company has decided to heavily restrict its functionality. This worthless organization sent out notices on December 9th about the changes they made on December 4th. Top notch integrity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Capitalism at its finest, I would say. If you have a free plan, you'll be able to just one notebook and 50 notes. In short, you wouldn't be able to use this if you don't have money. For a student like me, of course I couldn't afford to pay to use this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for about 10 years and have hundreds of notes and multiple notebooks full of lyrics, poems, lists, etc. I opened the app today to find that I'll no longer be able to use the app unless I pay $130/yr or $15/month, which is insane. I'll be moving my notes to another app soon. The developers have made a very stupid move charging a subscription fee, especially at that price. I'd gladly pay a one-time fee for this app, but the subscription model is terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every single time I open it, the ad comes up for a yearly subscription. $80 to take notes? No. It says ""you'll never get this offer back"" which is a lie, since it's every time I open it. Predatory and stupid. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Telling me I maxed out notes and can't make more when I don't have even close to 50. Been using this app since 2016 and it's just progressively gone downhill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The limit of 50 notes for free user makes me want to give 1 star"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't use it anymore after the update ... oh well guess I'll use a different notes app :/"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this for nearly a decade, but now you have gone too far with rhe heavy-handed push for Premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most recent update has finally killed Evernote for me. Found an alternative and moving my notes over as I speak"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is the maximum amount of notes so low? Imo 200 isn't even a lot for a NOTES APP where you might make 1000 separate notes for little things like birthdays and groceries. It stopped me at 182 notes but it says the limit is 50 so I assume rhat means the limit is new?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the new updates I'm excited about uninstalling this app. Eventually I will get all of my notes off of this app. Once that is done, I'll uninstall this app. This coupled with the random freezing & crashing has disincentivized me from continuing to use this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for at least 10 years, and it was good enough. But recently I've been getting annoying pop-ups to upgrade every single time I opened the app. I could (barely) live with that, but today I got restricted to 50 notes (I have many more), so I can't create any more new notes, and this app no longer serves its purpose. So, as soon as I backup all my notes (not easy), I'll be closing my account, uninstalling, and moving on to another free option with much more freedom of use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was a great notes app until the constant pop ups for their subscription service and being limited to 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHY DO WE NEED 2 PAY IF WE HAD THIS APP SINCE EVER😮‍💨 ??? WAS THE BEST APP EVER !! NOW ITS JUST TRASH , 😑 I Hope Yall Fix That 4 everyone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for over 10 years. I'd loved it, but the most recent version simply didn't work properly. The last straw for me was discovering that the free version no longer worked - when I was trying to take a note, no less! I'll be getting a different note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love evernote but now its constantly pushing me to upgrade (i dont want to, would rather have ads than pay them), it says ive reached my limit even tho i have 44 notes and limit is 50, it loses recent changes unless i keep the app open all the time. Get it together evernote! I dont think many folks want to pay for your upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Downloaded this app for the first time in 2012. Deleted it because pressing the back button takes you to the home page every time instead of going back to the previous (note/area/page) task I was on. Downloaded again Dec 2023. It still has the same issue that made me uninstalled the app in 2012 I would like that when the back button is pressed, it will take me to whatever I was previously on instead of closing the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is buggy and notes sometimes don't save and now they are forcing you to pay for a subscription for more than 50 notes. They're crazy you can download a million other note apps that don't make you pay for more than 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After months of tolerating the app losing entire pieces I've written and crashing after opening more than two notes in a row, I am suddenly paywalled out of making any more notes or notebooks. The plans are unaffordable for me and even if they weren't I wouldn't be inspired to upgrade my membership. I was happy paying nothing and getting less for it but I have very little incentive to cough up if the app hasn't functioned for a while now. I'll be looking to export and continue my work elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad experience because i cant add new notes unless I am paying for supscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years. The past few months I have had several times where I was using the app and taking notes and then when I would exit the note it would completely clear out everything that I had written and it would not be retrievable. Now I go into the app and they want me to pay $130/year or $15/month to continue using the app. No way....I'm switching to MS OneNote, it is included with my version of Office."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I don't mind limited notes but I have to be connected to the internet everytime I need to see my notes?? Worst update. And its lagging. Screen keept rotated automatically while I turn off the auto rotate feature on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my rating after years of use. Now it is all about ""upgrading"" to a super high price for something that other apps on here do for free and with a much better user experience. I'm in the process of deleting this app. No need for it no more. 1 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"December 9, 2023: Over time more basic features have become features for subscribers only. A few weeks ago I realized I can no longer view my notes offline, save them to my phone, or print to PDF. I try to count on this app for daily notes, shopping lists, etc. so it's pretty useless to me now. Unfortunate. July 29, 2023: app fixed again, but for how long? July 23, 2023 update: App was fixed for a few months after previous review, but problems returned..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became nagware long ago. But also changing allowances/limitations without giving sufficient notice nor explanation. What the free version provides has reduced several times to be closer & closer to useless for even casual users. You may be willing to pay today but there's no guarantee of the terms staying as is tomorrow (bait & switch). The larger problem now is loosing data from having 2+ notebooks & >50 notes. Atleast preserve current notes & allow easier export."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's been a must have app for years for me. Never saw much reason to upgrade to premium for my purposes. However, without warning, free accounts have been limited to one notebook and 50 notes. I double checked my email and they never notified me that this was happening. If they notified me via app, it was extremely unclear. I don't have much use for Evernote premium beyond unlimited notes. I'm only giving two stars because it was helpful in the past, but I can't recommend it anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Total trash since the new company took over. Been using Evernote for over 10 years, I have over 1500 notes as a creative writer and rely on this app and now there's a FIFTY note limit? $130 a year is absolutely ridiculous, disgraceful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I've used evernote since 2014, used to be great, now it's trash. Everytime I open I get an ad telling me to upgrade to premium. Everytime, it makes me click through multiple pop ups telling me it's a limited time offer. The limited time offer has been harassing me for literally a year. Now they've finally put the number of notes you can make behind a paywall. You can make 50 notes for free. I have 3900 notes made over 9 years. I can't make any more notes unless I pay them $159.99. Use notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"50 note limit? Seriously? I just under 1000 already"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this for years and absolutely loved it, but now requiring me to upgrade is a deal breaker. Free version is now 1 notebook and 50 notes. Unless you're willing to pay, don't use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote USED to be amazing, however, company was bought out and without warning, ""free"" accounts now have a 50 Note / 1 Notebook limit. That's barely anything. The ""paid"" plan they constantly send pop-ups to steer you towards is $16.99 a month. No way on earth I would ever spend this kind of money every month for 1 mobile phone app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pricing & the way you pushed it on customers is off. Leaving for OneNote, Bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Was great until they want to charge. Keeps going to debugged screen after i switched to a new phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good. Now it's slow, annoyingly full of ads, and there a limit of 50 notes which makes the free version absolutely useless for me. That's a pity. It once was a good app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"(Updated DEC 2023 below) I use Evernote mostly for saving recipes to share with my wife and daughter. It's easy to edit, adding ingredients or changing instructions in order to tailor a recipe to their tastes. 12/23 I've used the free version of Evernote for 10 years, collecting 1100 notes. Today I learned you're limiting me to 50 notes and 1 notebook. I want to transfer all those notes to a memory device for backup, yet contacting customer service is impossible. I'm very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using the free version for years with no issues, today it told me I can have a max of 50 notes or upgrade, I deleted notes and I am at 20 notes still gives me the same message! App had become very unreliable and tries to push for paid version so much! Have to look for another app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I paid for this product for 4 years. Then they did the UX overhaul and I dropped my subscription because the app became unreliable. They have improved the performance over the past few years, but from time to time: 1) some notes disappear after creation, 2) I get a duplicate note because of a conflict on the same device right after I've tried to edit that note, 3) notes fail to update their content, 4) substantial delays in sync between devices, etc. It's not yet worth the money they ask."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gave 5 stars to Evernote at 2016, used it for 7 years, but now deleted it frm my PC due to last update with only 50 notes alowed to keep at all. Free Evernote haven't sense any more. Sad, but i ll migrate my notes to other service. Good luck Evernote. Its your great mistake."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Welp, I used to like Evernote. Had it for a year. At first I could make as many notebooks and notes As I wanted for free. Now, I'm reduced to a single notebook and 50 notes. Whats the point in having a note app if I'm not even able to write down important things without paying for a yearly subscription of over $100? Originally I gave this app 3 stars. It would've been 5 I've it weren't for how buggy it was. Now, I'd give it -50 if I could. Immediately uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Free versions have limitations, I can understand that. However, online notes are definitely slower and what I want is a fast note taking app. While I can compromise on other features, this is not one of them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and even considered paying for it at one point, but it seems like the recent updates have made it very difficult to use. I get pop-ups constantly, bugs, and now I can't create notes without paying extra. I think it's time to look for a different note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sketch function just straight up doesn't work. I just paid $102, why?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful new policy Dec '23: you restricted my 100s of notes down to 50 maximum unless I pay for premium. Foolproof way to instantly dismiss a long-standing happy user. I used to recommend Evernote! that ship has sailed hahaha so sad. Going to find a new notes app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly started monetizing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reduced my previous 5 star to 1. I have been using Evernote for close to 10 years, and was a premium user whilst I was working. Now like, other companies, their greed has ruined the product. Another price increase for premium and a reduction in the free functionality was theast straw, I have moved to OneNote and I don't think I will be alone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app itself functions fine. The ability to access it on different devices is nice. The incessant ads for premium are why I'm switching to turtl, it's more secure anyway. Edit: I tried out turtl, didn't love it, came back to Evernote. And I thought, fine, you win, I'll get premium. I'm a student, so I looked up their student rate and I've spent probably an hour trying to get unidays to work. No go. It's time to abandon this app I've been using since 2012 bc of the now limited notes/notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been an Evernote user for many years now. The new option to limit free users notes and the dramatic price increases are predatory and greedy. Going to be looking for a new note app now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recent updates to the note-taking app have expanded features beyond its core purpose, leading to app bloat. Subscription restrictions, capping note quantity at 50 and introducing intrusive subscription prompts, have adversely impacted user experience. To compound matters, the backup process has become cumbersome, presenting challenges for users considering migration to more user-friendly alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"play I have never changed it so you only get 50 notes and one notebook for free. They used to be a lot more generous. They do not have a option to buy their services outright. You can only have a yearly subscription with them. I am going to start looking for a new note keeping app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I never leave reviews, ever. I have had evernote since 2014 and I'm now being told I have to pay 129 dollars A YEAR to make more than 50 notes? To have more than one notebook? This is absolutely unbelievable and money hungry. I'd give less than one star if I could because of this. I've tolerated a lot of bull from this app, but this is insane. Youve officially driven me away, congratulations."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Created a 50 note limit without notice for the free version. Ah well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"well, the BEST note app on the market has finally sold their soul. i have used this almost exclusively to organize recipes, planning, and more. today i taped ""new note"" and was informed that my ""current plan"" (free one I've always had) now only allows 1 notebook and 50 notes. i have about 8 notebooks and over 200 notes right now. i guess it's time to officially move to Journal It! incredibly disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"sick and tired of security checks. I need to take notes fast on my phones, and more often than not the app asks to re-login and doubles down by sending an email link to click on. I don't have time for that. either allow me to opt out, or I'll discontinue subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New policy..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app since 2012. It was easy to run on my phone & check on web. However, as the developer has progressively reduced functionality, limited the number of notes, limiting the free version to one device. Then charged for anything like those features making free effectively useless. Add to that the confusing interface and that's it! I refuse to pay the high premium for a dysfunctional product - OneNote and Keep are better. So as of today, Evernote is never to be used again & removed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of 7th of December 2023, the Free version got restricted to 50 notes and 1 Notebook (group of Notes). Essentially Updating it to make it more restrictive. To say that ""I broke into your app and broke it."" Is beyond me. I am already trying to move notes AWAY from my Evernote and it is not a happy process 😱😭 1 STAR SINCE 7TH OF DECEMBER 2023"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I could not use anything. It kept asking to upgrade. Used to be a good app back in the day"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over priced now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely awful app. Don't be fooled, there is no free version. The free download is just a vehicle for pop up ads for the paid version, and I wouldn't pay 89p per for this mess, let alone £89."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have reached my limit with Evernote. They've decided to hold me hostage and force me to pay a subscription in order to create any new notes above 50. I've been using this for years and have hundreds of notes. All of a sudden they are imposing a note limit on the free version? Nope. App has been slow and constantly begging for money for the past six months or so anyways. This is the nail in the coffin."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be able to have unlimited notes but now you can have a maximum of 50. No warning that this was happening. Now I can't make any more notes without paying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My go to app to put all my miscellaneous info: book recommendations, grocery lists, poetry drafts, etc. Such a helpful way to stay organized."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"10 years with y'all and things have gotten noticeably worse recently. The incessant, unappealing upgrade pushes were annoying, but manageable. However, now we can't open any new notes because of an arbitrary limit set with a new update? This is a note taking app, not an entire productivity platform. You are hemorrhaging customers and driving your reputation into the ground. Will be seeking a less inept service moving forward. Hope y'all find your way back to what made you great..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Garbage as free version now. I'm below the limit on amount of notes, but still can't make a new one. Get something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always liked the organizational structure, but the app only lets you have 1 notebook and 50 notes on free plan, and to upgrade to Premium costs over $120 a year despite it still being far out of date and slow in comparison to other completely free apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly limiting users to 50 notes in order to get people to pay £80 to use this service is a really scummy move. Will be moving to a different note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unfortunately the app is no longer free but paid, expensive pay at that. Useless company that doesn't listen to its main community."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"PRODUCT HAS GONE DOWN HILL! Example even the feedback option pops a mail window with no mail to: address. Kind of hard to send feedback with no address. Syncs take forever, like don't count on them to work, if they do expect duplicates, share notes features doesnt work any longer, no customer support, not even on the paid plans. Support website says restructuring. They keep releasing new features that don't seem to fit anything and aren't fixing their core base features they were built on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app WAS an okay alternative to Google Docs. Then there was an update and free version users can only have one notebook. I have two (from before the update) and the only solution is to delete one and lose all my writing. And I can't add any new notes. Terrible forethought and total disrespect for your own users. The only reason I don't uninstall is because I'll lose around 20 pages of work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had an account for over 10 years and had recommended it constantly to others. Apparently that was shooting myself in the foot, since, after slowly taking away functionality on the free tier, Evernote is now so big that they will charge you for ANY functionality on an ongoing basis. Time to get everything important out of there and let everyone know to not even bother with this awful company who stabs their longtime users and advocates in the back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please don't bother. I have used Evernote for over 10 years. Today they enforced a policy for free users - a limit of one Notebook and 50 notes. I had about 15 Notebooks and over 750 notes I made over the last decade so I cannot use the app. Up until not they would prompt every time I used the app to upgrade. No migration options so manually copying and pasting every note to Google Keep. Don't bother, use Keep or OneNote. Evernote are cash grabbing buttheads. 10 years, for what? Rubbish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think its really bad form to start limiting the number of notes after it being free for so long. And it doesn't seem a reasonable price to pay for unlimited notes. I'll only be keeping the app as an archive of my old notes and looking to start using a new app going forward, hopefully one that's not being as slow as this one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The constant pop ups and now the limitation of notes and notebooks for the free version is making me switch to another app after 10 years using it. Shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a member since 2014 and now they want to limit you to 50 notes a year. I'll be transferring my content."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I signed up yesterday and have a whopping total of one (yes, 1) notes and am being told that I've reached my limit. I'm better off using Post-Its."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love this app, it contains good articles to have distinguish and more professional productivity life change."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just changed my password, and I can't login cause it says that it's incorrect"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Joined Evernote in Aug 2011! As these guys have started forcing for Premium Subscription I guess it's my Time to leave this App. But I want to leave this on happy note that You guys have built a remarkable App! Former Evernote Fan! Nisarg"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its so upsetting the new update, i can not create any notes anymore Ive been using the app since 2016 that's 7 years and now im supposed to pay 15 dollars monthly just to create a regular plain note. Well i gave up the pretty extra stuff that i had to pay for ,but not the notes .. Please leave it the way it was before so we can keep creating unlimited notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad experience..please avoid yearly package monthly package.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I've been using Evernote for many years now as my diary. I was going to create a new note today, but all of the sudden an ad popped up that I need to update to create a new note as with current plan I can only have one notebook and 50 notes. I ALREADY HAVE OVER 600 NOTES! I would have considered upgrading but the way Evernote is pushing the update gets on my nerves. ""Are you sure you don't want to upgrade?? You will not receive this offer again!"" Continues to receive it twice a day for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"loved this app and used it for several years, but the popups for upgrading my account have been getting more frequent and my breaking point was that now all the free features I could use are locked behind paying over 100 bucks a year? did you guys get bought by EA or something? this is god awful and pretty much confirming I'll find a better writing alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2014 and only in the last year it's gone down hill FAST! Wanting you to pay for everything and it's an outrageous price too. I will be uninstalling this app and I hope you to do. Don't waste your time on it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If a deal is truly one-time, then why do I get spammed every time I open the app 🤔? Edit: hahahahha yeah no way. Move to notion, the better app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"been losing my notes all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've relied on this app for several years to help me manage my ADHD, but now that they're massively limiting the features of their free version I'll be moving everything to Google Drive. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app quits instead of navigating back when I tap ""my device's Back button"" on a note, please fix it. (Android 13, Redmi Note 11)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and was OK with the decline in feature avalibility for free users, in good fate. However, waking up to suddenly being unable to move, edit, create, or even delete any of my notes with a message (that I was not notified of in advance btw) saying I can only have 50 notes and 1 notebook was the last straw, this is a HUGE change and makes the app not worth any more of my time. I've downloaded all of my notes to pdf and deleted my account. Money hungry and unethical."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE 2023: Constant nagging to upgrade has reached a fever point. Add to that the ever-increasing price plans and, though the app rates 5 stars, due to user experience this is now a ZERO STAR TURD. Working on my exit. --- WAS the best way to organize data across devices. I do lengthy entry & editing on a computer, but can still use my phone. Handwriting, pictures, doc scanning, & so on. The search function made it all come together. A cheaper version is needed. I just need offline & search."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The sudden change to make the free version worse is a cheap way to get more money out of its users. 1 notebook, 50 notes as of Dec 4, 2023. This is fine if you're not taking detailed notes every day, multiple times a day, and have no need to keep old notes. For students however, I reccomend looking into other options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To college students: With the new limit of 50 notes, you can keep about 2 classes worth of notes if you make a new note for each class. The service is essentially worthless now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had a bad feeling that one day the free version would become so restrictive as to become worthless to me. I've used Evernote for years. Happily leaving with their latest choice to remove features from free users. It's not their first time doing it! Get a better business model than taking things away from people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just cancelled my subscription. I've been using Evernote for the last 10 years and been a paid subscriber for the past 2. Increasing the cost of the personal plan from £47 to £80, for no improvement of features, is simply ridiculous. The note system is broken, the website and app loads slow. The service is getting worse and the cost is increasing. What?!?!? Try harder. Goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All of a sudden they changed the free plan only One Notebook and 50 notes! Seriously Going back to OneNote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you know its crazy. actually as soon as I purchased a subscription to this app as I needed to sync with 3 or 4 devices, the experience just became horrible, you want to make a new note on Samsung S23 Ultra, press new note it takes like 10 or 20 seconds until you can actually type offline notes don't work, you can even search for them the new windows app don't let you sort by data size shocking how this app is getting worst and worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a user for several years. Cost is now absurd. Going to free mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous restrictions! Almost impossible to get all of your data out of this wretched program once it is there. USE NOTION OR ANYTHING ELSE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible Update to the free version, they've limited the amount of notes you can make per month and barade you with a payment plan every time you open the app, disgusting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been using the Personal tier for a couple of years now, and it has been worth it to me. But I see the price will be more than doubling when my next renewal comes up, and it just won't be worth it, so I won't be renewing my service when it comes around. Shame, really. Fine tool, but not worth what they're asking IMO."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always auto rotate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Love the app but 15/month feels really unreasonable. Will probably check out other options. Apps like todoist with plenty of features that make it worth the upgrade charge ~4/month. When I look at the features provided on upgrade all I really see is ""we'll stop being annoying"" with limiting you to 1 Device and 50 notes, upgrade spam etc... Update. in the end I'm going to pay at a discounted price but I do feel like I was bullied into it. I think if I had the time to switch over to notion I woul"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"7 Dec 2023. With the new Evernote plans I can no longer use Evernote for free. Switching to a free OBSIDIAN plan. I will be able to import my Evernote notes. 15 March, 2023 update: Since updating my phone from a S7 to Galaxy S23+, & using the latest version of Evernote (10.48), it has worked flawlessly over the last month, both on my mobile and on my Windows 11 laptop. I previously had to use Evernote version 8.13.3 on my S7 & had problems with notes not saving a few times a month."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app updates every day, but with every update, it becomes slower and has more bugs. And no they limit the amount of notepads and notes. I don't want to pay for apps that become worse every day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Disappointing app experience. It sporadically crashes rendering it unusable. Then it randomly starts working. Especially frustrating in light of the recent (significant) price hike."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"932 what say you want"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved Evernote but I got an email today (it wasn't even an email, it was just a short rude message) with the title: Evernote Free is now limited to 50 notes.. I mean really? No heads up, no explanation.. I suppose I should thank you for letting me access my account so I can copy all my notes and move them somewhere else.. Shame. It was a really good program but I hate companies that don't care about their customers. Wish you all the best anyway. Thanks for being there for so many years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed that the app could last so well for so long and now seems to suffer from the same ""change everything every month"" mentality alot of apps do nowdays. Just a bloated slow mess now constantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping Notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is actual dogwater now. No, it's less than that--its poop on your shoe. I get you have new limits to Free users, that's ok, I'll delete most of my stuff so I stay below the 50 note + 1 notebook limit. So why is it that my note is only 23 KB but I'm locked behind a ""sorry your note or account has reached the limit"" warning??? I only have 1 notebook and 6 notes, none of which surpass 25 mb, but this joke of an app is deadset on making me pay. Well no thanks, I'm just going uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrorising and making work impossibble. Going to notion. After 12 years...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid being burned, stay away from this app. Price is outrageous and the headache isn't worth it. Everything workflow oriented is locked behind a paywall, and then so was every half decent feature that made the app worth keeping. I have never had the pleasure of evernote being anything but a clunky frustrating to use notepad, where every time you open the app I you are asked if I want to upgrade to premium. I have lost entire notes and had to pay for a month to get them back, twice..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Upgrade to what? Evernote is just a complete mess now. New device ... notes gone and an endless stream of advertising and notifications to subscribe to what is now just a mess. Life is too short to be dealing with this nonsense. Fear not evernote ... I will re-write them down on a piece of paper with a pen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using evernote for 10 years almost with up to 4000 notes, and without prior notice, they announced that the free version basically no longer exists and only offers up to 50 notes, leaving me no option but to find an alternative. Subscriptions are very expensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have long transitioned to a self-hosted note taking system (Joplin). End to end secure and costs me nothing a month. I recently popped back into Evernote to export a few old documents, and I'm immediately bombarded with tons of ads to sign up for premium. And then I get an email saying free tier users only get 50 notes and 1 notebook. lol Old review from 2015: Simple to use. Infinitely scalable and moldable for any use. OCR technology is amazing. I use it to scan in receipts for my business."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"金の亡者になったようで。。。"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version is now limited to 50 notes only. Its looks like users extortion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User since 2013. The app is now upgrade intrusive. Unable to delete account. It only deactivates. No support email. Do not waste your money. There are free alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years and the recent update forces you to upgrade for a ludicrous price or only have 1 notebook and 50 notes. For something that was once free. I loved this app, but now I will have to look for a new one. I am not paying for somwthing that was once free to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for a decade, and I loved it. I have thousands of notes. Now it tells me I can't make ANY new notes, because they've downgraded the Free plan to 50 notes at a time. It's absurd, and I cannot overstate how upset I am. I am now looking for somewhere to export my notes to. Good job driving off your whole userbase, Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Extremely buggy on Android. Years ago was decent but now it's like the developer doesn't even use his own product. Where are the updates?? Exiting a note stutters, opening a note is a hit or miss on first attempt. Smh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow and facing a lot of bugs in a compatible device😒 it's not smooth as it was before"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is so slow on mobile nd iPad. Takes an eternity to open or load."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update trying to force an upgrade. Plenty of older, active free users have much more than 1 notebook with 50 notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Major improvements are done in comparison to last year. It was painfully long, it would be better if Evernote solved the issues sooner. Updated from 1 star to 4 stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Taking a photo of a business card locks the app I un-installed and reinstalled sever times. Still not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whoever is in charge of product at this company should be fired. What happened? Evernote used to be great. It's just constant bugs and popups asking for 'one-time offers' now. Horrible user experience. To top it off, it's become so slow that even as a basic note-taking app it struggles. Garbage. Moving to Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"no opportunity to make text size changes permanently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I originally made a review for this in 2012, and have used this app for 11 years. Now I plan on exporting 1000+notes to another app because of the new restrictions on free acounts, (1 notebook with 50 notes). They also will constantly bombard the user with ""limited time deals"" and over time the features have gotten worse and worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stop making it so people have to pay for VERY BASIC FUNCTIONALITY. The new update with a limited amount of notes will be your grave, and you have lost me as a customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is the best I could find back in the days after Palm Pilot suite demise. Transferred all the notes from Palm Desktop into Evernote. It has been working great 98% of the time. Once in a while, an update will break main functionality - notes syncing, so if the version I have now works fine, I tend to skip new updates. But it works, never lost a note. Just be careful in the note body, not to ""Select All"" and press a letter by mistake, will wipe out the note, and if you save, cannot undo."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The limit of linked devices is too low that its difficult to work on the app without signing up for their relentless bombardment of promotions to sign up. One issue I have is that even though there's currently only one linked device, I am not able to link another devices. It keeps prompting one to upgrade in order to link more devices. This is despite only having 1 linked device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is often buggy and at each login it asks to upgrade my plan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Demasiada publicidad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used this app for a long time now but this trying to force ppl to join their monthly or yearly plan does not make sense and honestly if this continues, I think I will just leave the app, how can I have one or two device and removed one more than once but yet I am not allowed to use the app in peace, I constantly keep getting the same message remove device or update remove what more device, am so irritated fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is my first time to use this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WHERE IS THE SYNC BUTTON!!!??????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Leave it today and I choose Notion!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to attach photos"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since they force me to buy anual plan, I enormously dislike this. Now I have to transfer all my 600 notes into other notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So it's useless now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Android apps version having a bug, when I reading a notes, every time I press return button in android (not the return button at the top left side in Evernote apps) will count me press twice and quit the apps, hope that will fix it soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this app for years for all my studies and work. However the amount cap they added for notes before you have to pay is ridiculous. The way the app kept pushing for premium plans is annoying. I'll be migrating my notes elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've tried many notes apps. I like this one the best. EDIT: Springing the ""1 notebook, 50 note"" limit on existing users who already have well above that is simply not acceptable. This is ludicrously restrictive and makes the app borderline unusable. But even before then there were constant issues with crashing every time you leave even the simplest of notes. Not a responsive app. Please do better, Evernote, I would really prefer to keep using your service rather than finding a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great App. All kinds of things that work. lists , to do, shopping list, pictures with your notes and on it goes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldnt Live Without. Now I Must Replace It. Used this app for over a decade, only to find out that they will limit me to 50 notes? I have hundreds, if not thousands, on here. I noticed they HEAVILY push you to subscribe and pay every time you log in recently. The company seems to be in panic mode and cannot figure out how to make money. I now have the task of transferring all my notes to Google Keep since I fear that Evernote's demise is pretty immenent. It was great while it lasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote is a great note taking app with great methods for taking notes, but recently there's been an ""offer"" every single time I've tried to open my notes, forcing me to cancel the offer, close the app and reopen it, only to be met with a slow loading app. My phone is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra w. 16 gigs of RAM and 512 GB storage, both still low in use and a fully updated phone in pristine condition, so it's definitely not phone related. I hope this gets remedied in the near future."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"price plan is obscene gouging and getting more expensive and the apps getting worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The bugs and advertisements have increased hand-in-hand over the last year. I now encounter an ad and a bug pretty much each time I use the app. And now, I am limited on the amount of notes I can have to 50. Continually degrading my experience has not persuaded me to upgrade. Had Evernote offered a purchase option, instead of a subscription, I might have considered upgrading at one time. But since they are a ""service,"" and a bad one at that, I will move on instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the free version for years, but just recently they changed it to where you are limited to 50 notes unless you upgrade and pay $15 a month. I'll be moving to a different service, it's just a notepad after all, not really worth such an exorbitant expense."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm gone. Goodbye Evernote. As many others have stated, degrading quality, useless new ""features"", constant ads, and now this change to the free plan has got me fed up. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless piece of sheet. No longer works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a great free note app that turned into an ad mess and now force to pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"THIS PETTY COMPANY NOW RESTRICTS FREE PLAN TO 1 NOTEBOOK AND 50 NOTES! Horrible, convoluted, buggy editing interface on both mobile and desktop requires lots of effort to modify or continue note taking. Feature requests and bug reports go unaddressed for years at a time. I wouldn't mind paying a modest one-time $10 fee if the interface wasn't so bad, but I'm not paying $70/year for an ongoing subscription. Time to migrate to a better platform like Joplin, OneNote or Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greedy and rubbish. It was one of the few apps I was happy to pay for, at £45 a year. I put up with the app becoming unstable, and feature bloat. They've just made the free option so small as to be unusable (so I can't share with people who aren't power users) and after 12 loyal years doubled my fee. When I went to cancel they then offered to reduce it to what I was paying already like it was a favour. You've ruined your own business and I hope it hurts, you greedy people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bro just make it unusable without subscription Bye bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was 4stars 23/11/2021 but the constant intrusive asking to upgrade to premium (requires 3 additional clicks to close window and confirm that you don't want to upgrade every single time you open up the app) has made using this app a dread. Trying out new/different note taking apps now and will be deleting EverNote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After recent update , app is worst in regular use , old one was superb , provide old version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Like thousands others, I am disgusted with your new pricing and business model. Time to move on..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new limit of one notebook and fifty notes on the free version is way too low. So I've cancelled my account and moved to Joplin."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It takes 10 seconds or more to open an app and start a note. I forget what I wanted to write by this time sometimes. Used to be much faster about 4-6 months ago, before the redesign. Why bloat the home page and make it harder to use the main app functionality? Update: now even switching back to the app makes it reload your already opened note, such a time waste. Upd: now there is a black screen when I switch bank to the app. Taking notes should not be that hard nor buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This may be the death of evernote. Very disappointed with the stance that has been taken"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I quite love this application greatly, whatever information or note taken and synchronized remains indeed forever as long as the account used in operating it is operational. However, in recent past it could no longer open for me view files. I'm tempted to delete it and forget about it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has continued to have bugs for over 6 months. It is a note taking app, not an overly complex system. Now they force an overpriced subscription model with capping free at 50 notes. I would pay a few dollars a month for a quality note taking app but $15 a month for the cheapest plan is ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. It used to be great, now i cant even log onto my mobile app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad security."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years. Sudden changes including pushing for purchase with every open, being obnoxious about ""promos"" and now limiting my notes space. Very bad. Anyone knows better apps for notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote has been a powerful tool to help me overcome the common issues associated with ADHD (a.k.a neurodivergent, a.k.a creative brain), such as forgetfulness and disorganization. I used the app to help me capture ideas, stay focused, and manage my day-to-day to-dos list. I gave Evernote a 3-star review due to a poor experience over the last 3 months. I'll update my review to 5 stars after Evernote fixes its technical issues and provides a bug-free experience for the next 3 months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst app experience ever. before you did all those so called ""improvements"" of yours, things at least worked but now it's just a disaster of an app. I will move soon. edit: it's really funny and sad at the same time that after years they still don't get it and don't realize how bad this app is. most likely they just don't care. edit: i really hate this app. Evernote has become a nightmare."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 2023: They've managed to make the app worse. Can't make a new note on mobile now. Switching to Microsoft OneNote permanently. Each new update they've made over the last year has plagued the app with lag, errors and issues. What was once a reliable tool has become, at some points, useless and inconvenient. Unacceptable, especially for the paid plans. Already considering alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a loyal customer. I have this on every device. I started using it when the Bible study that I have, Olive tree, backed up to this program. Now on my G Pad and my phones - all Samsung Android, it opens and won't save anything and then closes. It is working fine on the computer. Please fix this issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I appreciate this app and use it for anything that I need to access across devices without emailing myself back and forth. But so help me, it pushes an offer to upgrade every single time I open it and each time it requires you to 'x' out of it and then press decline on a pop-up that tells you you won't get this offer again! What a joke and massive annoyance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is all about trying to sell an upgrade than actually allowing you to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote Used to be a really nice app! Now can't even save my notes. This note-taking app is garbage 👎👎👎👎👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free users can't customize the home screen. I really hate latest Evernote. I'm considering the alternate app. 12-03-2023 Found the alternate app. Bye bye, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is not working well on my Android. I no longer recommend this product. It keeps crashing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app since April 2011. It has changed so much over the years. It used to have all my notes, the notes that I WROTE, WHICH I OWN, on my phone but these greedy folks decided to remove my access to them and then ask me for a yearly fee to access them. Uninstall instantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my favorite note taking app, I've been a Premium customer and a Free customer over time, but the worse updates made me not want to pay for Premium features, so I didn't. I've lost notes because of the apps functionality vs the way it used to be (autosave). And features keep getting changed and the platform slowly got worse. Now they've limited the Free version so much, this is unusable and their prices are ridiculous for the features they think they want us to have. timetomoveon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After this recent update? Horrible experience trying to navigate app. No more biometeics/ pin protection??👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After upgate, image is not loaded at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They have driven me away with incessant asking me to change my plan and now limiting my notes. If they gave me unlimited access for $40 a year I'd do it. But over $100 to take notes? No thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very annoying pop up offers to buy the program. Every time is a unique offer that you can not have it again if you don't take it.... And always coming up the same."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has become clunky. the premium plans have lot of unncessary features that i dont need. Just need it to work on 3 devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucks. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fun and easy-to-use for creating your favorite stuff!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too many adds expecting you to pay for more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for more than a decade - since 2012. They created their subscription plan, which is fine, but more than I needed so I never subscribed, especially for the orice. But they just changed their model to only being allowed ONE NOTEBOOK AND 50 NOTES MAX! Insane. No way a note taking app is worth what they're trying to charge per month and this is just a disgusting tactic. There are plenty of other options. Find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2023/12/03 EN sucks now. My note 2023/12 just disappeared!!! A search yields 2023/11 only. Not sure, EN is using dirty tricks to get me to a paid version? Stop this low down tactic !! (2023/08/28 Mon in 44. EN is back to normal now. EN CANNOT be trusted as they are money hungry now.) 2023/03/12. No, EN still created a conflicted copy of my newly named note file. Most frustrating.!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using evernote since 2016 and now they push to upgrade I'm looking for something else bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became paywall to even see the notes you've made over years. Can't even open a note to get it and start using some other note app. TRASH"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to be in love with this app...but now it's full of bugs and constantly offering payment offers. This is beginning to be an irritating problem. I go to review a note and the screen goes blank. The copy/paste cursor works when it wants to. I may have to start looking for another note app and I really don't want to. 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been hacked! Change your passwords!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. The UI changed completely and sucks. Nobody wants to view their notes side to side like that. It was better the way it was. And now on Android it glitches where you'll write your note, only to come back and have it be gone. What's the point of a notes app that doesn't keep notes? Update: still 1 star but wish I could give 0 because I've been using evernote for years yet now you have to pay $78/year just to have more than 50 notes. Just another money grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A user since 2009, sadly deleted my account today after the changes extremely limiting the app. So disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not interested in this app.stop asking to update it.i don't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always kept 5 star, since when you messed up this free plan. You deserve 1 star. All notes exported, time to say bye!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using the free version for 10+ years and it's got all the features I will ever need!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This company insists on neutering its own product for free users in a desperate attempt to drive sales. At this point I'm over it. I've used Evernote for years and I enjoyed its usefulness during that time. But they continue to restrict it further and further. At the end of the day, it's a note app. Sure, it has some great features. But limiting the amount of notes and your ability to organize them? That's despicable. We're talking about text files here. I'm over it. Do better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hey, do you want annoying pop ups about ""one time offers"" every time you open the app to make a note? Then this is the app for you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The change to 250 notes and one notebook for free users is very disappointing. Just as I got back into using this app again for studying too! Off to another app I suppose."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is wrong with my Evernote app I want to see my notes I saved but it is showing blank page, it doesn't even allow me to write notes anymore, and I need to get an important note there"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant login with google."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ok Evernote, I understand you need money to run, but you can't think of having it all in one year. I have been using this app since 10 years I guess and now suddenly you decide to charge me ₹ 500 INR/ Month for creating an extra note. I would be really ok in paying ₹50 INR/Month and keep using the app. Think clearly, Do you want 1 out of 10 people to pay 500 and remaining 9 hunt for a better app. Or you want 9 out of 10 people pay you 50 bucks. Make use of the large user base and charge wisely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After storing hundred of notes over many years, I can now no longer use this without upgrading. No warning about this, no time to change my habits, no way to contact support. What a sad demise, what a way to throw out your customer base... Pathetic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was top on the market. Now it has become a blotware. Step by step, the development is out of control making the app now super slow, difficult to use, bugged (e.g. in Android it rotates screen even if Android has the option ""Not auto-rotate"" enabled). Searching right now an alternative application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't bother downloading, they are in the ""actively remove features and try to squeeze every drop of money we can out of longtime users"" stage. Genuinely unusable at times. Often can't open anything because the app gets stuck in a loop trying to open their premium popup, but you can't actually read any of your notes until you go through the popup. Sometimes even requiring you to force stop the app and try again 3+ times before it decides to function. Greed ruins everything in the end."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Features are really good but I have to leave this platform because of many restrictions on free users. I can't even buy any subscription plan because of country restrictions. Really disappointed with the latest decision of Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was my go to application when it comes to saving any notes or any of my write-ups. But the recent changes made by the team has made my experience not so great. 1. Just for saving the notes and limiting to 50 notes is not a right move because there are people who are not using any other features. 2. The reason to use Evernote was it was the most user-friendly app I have ever used hand's down but recently after an update i don't feel the same. It's a request to give us back our Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not safe and dangerous. No privacy. Someone from brazil keep log in my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new owners 70% more $$$ monthly AND ""free"" service gutted, pulling an ELON company is doomed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't log in with my Google account. I tap account to pick and nothing happens. No access to whatever data I'm losing due to the new limitation. Terrible experience. So you didn't make enough $ off of data collection, you've turned the app into a trial that doesn't really let one understand or get dependent on the power of a sub."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"1 notebook and 50 notes aren't enough for trial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note-taking app out there!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Note taking app that can't handle apostrophes. I'm not a developer, so it's hard for me to comprehend how you can be so incompetent at your job"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for ages. It was just super. Now, limit is 1 notebook, 50 notes for the free plan. Huge mistake from them. Too bad. Gonna switch for another one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app but out of the blue forced me into a 50 note limit. Meanwhile I have hundreds of notes, and recently loading notes from the cloud has become very slow. Sometimes it takes several minutes to load a note. Evernote also won't let you delete notes without opening them. I'm going to spend hours deleting notes just so I can create a new one? Forget it! There are plenty of other note taking apps out there, I'm done with Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't write more than 50 notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used evernote for years for personal and professional writing projects. I have recommended it to friends and colleagues. I have thousands of notes and several notebooks. I really, truly loved evernote. I will not use it when we have to pay for more than 50 notes and one notebook. I'm sorry. that is absurd. I know the loss of one free user doesn't matter much, but I'm very sad to go. I wish it wasn't like this, but limiting the number of notes is too far. I will not pay."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"On Evernote since 2010, progressively worse experience. Used it exclusively until about 2018 on a free account. Then, as free, not so limited alternatives appeared (Google Keep) , I started to use them more and more. Now, I'm sad to report that once great Evernote experience diminished into compete oblivion, asking to upgrade on every turn, while being sluggish and nowhere near Google Keep or Microsoft One Note. The android mobile app is a total mess, even bloody swipe back gesture leaves app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been slow & buggy for years, clearly dying a slow death but today's limiting of free users is the final nail in the coffin. Instead of making a product users want to purchase they're holding your notes over 50 hostage. Do yourself a favor try an alternative instead. Joplin & Obsidian are great and there's plenty of others out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"my Evernote experience, great since 2010, until hardware upgrade~fold5... then 😞 since getting a fold5 the app constantly crashes when opening notes to view, either from home page or in notebooks crashes so often, the Ai/algorithm repeatedly asks if I want to uninstall please fix this i use En daily, however, this issue has become so frustrating, i'm considering the Ai's offer~to let it proceed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Be careful! That campany is a pure scam. I paid for a year subscription. Even though they been charging me additionally monthly fee. Did not answer any of my request for days and weeks. Trying to overcharged my credit card and at the and downgraded my to ""free"" version despite the fact that they admit it was their foult. Now they simply don't answer any of my tickets. Avoid!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After many years as a paid user, I've finally had it with Evernote's endless cash-grabs all accompanied by an ongoing decline in all versions of the app. Only Evernote could be this arrogant. On top of removing huge amounts of functionality, what remains works glacially slowly if at all. I've splashed out very little money for the pro version of UPNOTE which is fast, easy to use and achieves everything Evernote fails to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The concept of the app is what I liked the most about it, hence the 3 ⭐ however the app is not good enough, it doesn't sync, doesn't work on multiple devices everytime. I wrote a notebook on my laptop for my exams and shared the link to phone, few minutes back on exam I refered it and guess what the notes weren't sync/ updated. Its a hell of an experience. Please fix these problem. Keep the synchronization autoupdates for every seconds."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not usable anymore unless you have the paid version which is a pity, it used to be great!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The service is ok but imagine my surprise when the first year cost $60 and the second year cost $160."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They kept removing feature from the free tier, so no reason to keep using it or even recommending it. The exact samr thing happened to Lastpass."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't complete expectations.... So simple"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for many years. Loved it for a while. A year ago they started pushing you to upgrade. Every single time you opened the app, you would have to decline the offer and get to your notes. Extremely frustrating and very counter productive when having to write down or search for a note in a fast paced working environment. Starting today, they limit you to 1 notebook and 50 notes or you have to upgrade! That's it! I'm deleting and moving onto a better app and platform. See ya!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have the subscription version, AND YET, Each time you open the app it takes TOO LONG before its finished LOADING and By then you have forgotten half of what you wanted to write, while on the old phone it works faster, BUT it hasn't got all the same features as on the new phone, on which I Have Cleared the memory space, but which doesn't change how long it takes to open or load upon opening the app. (it seems that with each update, the new phone gets worse and worse; can't detect the WiFi now)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having used Evernote for literal years (nearly a decade now), I've toughed it out with all the recent updates. But now it's getting ridiculous. Features that have been available in the free plan are being removed. Being able to make unlimited notes and notebooks being one of them. This is unfair, especially to loyal customers who have been using this application for a long time. I will be looking for a new app to use in light of this. This is insidious behaviour."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be better. Now they want money for basic features and their interface makes it difficult to find your stuff. 2023 - Totally unusable unless you subscribe, which is very expensive. Whoever is in charge of this app is unethical and greedy. Avoid. You have been warned."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very disappointed. Keeps crashing. It occasionally works, but had been crashing repeatedly and had become unusable. I used to love this app. But now I'm finding myself exporting my notes on my pc to another app.. no bug fixes and no support.. I've emailed but nothing. Your quality had gone seriously downhill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They should offer a free use option w ads. Been able to use for free for over a decade. The value of paying subscription is nowhere near fair value for the products services."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app with the free plan since 2014. I have had issues with messaging, file sharing, and collaboration since 2014. I chalked it up to being glitchy because it's the free version, no big deal. Today I go to make a new note as I have thousands of times before and am suddenly hitting a paywall telling me I'm only allowed 1 notebook with 50 notes unless I pay for a subscription that didn't used to exist. My notes are still there but I'm waiting for them to disappear on me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User for years, then the free version is 1 notebook and 50 notes? Paywall bullsh-t for no reason but a broken app and glitchy service. Years of notes and convenient ruined by greed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app. for quick simple notes you can share across all your devices. I've been using ot for years . 5 Stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I'd say one in five notes I write in this app don't save and I lose everything from it. That's not good for a note taking app. Used it too long to change now though but we wary"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I used Evernote on mobile, I experienced multiple bugs. 1) I can't capitalize words; there's a bug where the app doesn't capitalize the word, but instead deletes it along with a few letters of text following the word. 2) I can't delete select groups of text; there's a bug where it deletes not only the text, but a few characters following it. 3) For a similar reason, you can't replace highlighted text via glide-typing. 4) The app sometimes auto-rotates, even when auto-rotate is disabled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Other tan the device being swiped it's awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"requires an account for a god damn notes app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's an incredibly good notes app. However, while I'd love to give it five stars, it's hindered by constant pop-ups advertising the premium version, etc. I understand that's the only way they make money, but at a certain point it's ridiculous. The only other problem is the unintuitive UI. It's got many features beyond any competing apps, but it's not organized super well, and the home page is quite cramped. All in all a notch above similar notes apps in features, but a notch below in usability."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is now telling me I'm limited to 50 notes when I have 25 and it is forcing me to upgrade. Yet my husband has 500 notes and is in the fee account. I can't contact customer service because there is no way to do so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Antes era una maravilla pero ahora cada maldita vez que abres la aplicación te sale el aviso de ""ultima oportunidad para adquirir nuestra suscripción a plan premium"". Llevo un año diariamente con la última oportunidad. Me tienen frito"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a user for 6+ years. The last 2-3 years way too many ads that you can't turn off. Too expensive to upgrade to the lowest paid version. And over the last 6 months, on Android the app crashes and creating a new note takes way too long to load. Looking to transfer my note taking database to another service soon as Evernote continues to go downhill."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes unless we upgrade, will have to switch to other note-taking apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great piece of software that I use every day"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updates are disappointed 😴"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"R.I.P this app Not only is the app dead, but it's trying to take users content with it to the grave. Let me at least export my **** and get on with my life. I feel like someone should take legal action against them for what they have done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Once upon a time, this was a good app. Now it loses data constantly, doesn't save, saves 16 copies of the same thing, mysteriously deletes info in notes, won't open at all etc. What a heap of junk."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not talking input from the S-Pen and not convenient for the hand written notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant popup ads trying to sell me a paid subscription have made this app nearly unusable. I will never want the paid subscription. I can just use MS Word. The ads need to stop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was trying to get back into writing but the new version stopped me from creating with its 50 note cap. Shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I reviewed this app in 2019, gave it 5 stars, and highly recommended it. I've used Evernote for more than 10 years. I keep lists (bullet point, emunerated, and checklists), reminders, notes, recipes, & pictures. There has been a recent update, limiting the free version to 1 notebook and 50 notes. This effectively makes the free version of Evernote a trial version. The prices were high before the update, and now they're higher. I'll be moving my notes & dumping the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To many upgrade ads and I can't find out how many devices I can have on the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WOW. I've been a user since 2012 and with no warning I am blocked from creating new notes unless I upgrade to premium. That is wrong. I'm so disappointed and upset."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"LoL. 1 notebook and 50 notes? that's funny as hell. After this I must say goodbye to Evernote forever. Glitchy app, slow loading of notes and now this? that's just unbelievable, open your eyes people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I came here just to give the worst grade for Evernote... 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost a few notes and now I can't even open my old notes? Why is this happening? Probably the worst popular notes app ever!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I feel assaulted each time I open the app. Why can't the app remember our choice when we decline the ""special offer"" that's there every day? The amount of pop-up ads to subscribe when on the free tier is insane and if they were a person, you would get a restraining order. Sad that Evernote turned into that over needy friend. It was an all-star back in the day that everyone loved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have to pay for more than 50 notes now? Even though I have 4k notes over the years? The free version of this app is now completely unusable, do not download as it's just a trap to allow you to buy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bending spoons have totally changed how I feel about this app. I'm off to use OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After ten years it's time to say goodbye. The free version is now so limited that it became unusable. And the pricing for paid plans is just ridiculous. The charge as much as per year as large competitors want to have for entire office suites. Sorry... It was nice to have but not for that price. There are enough cheaper alternatives. Ciao!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a fantastic app, which I used extensively for years. However since it has limited notes to only 50 on the free version it has become unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I use this app everyday. I would like to be able to lock the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Automatically signed me into a paid plan. I did not realize what had happened, until a popuo was stating I would be on a weekly plan. Dark practices, and shady moves at this company. Sad that it's gone downhill this much for what is a great app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using a freaking kill switch and limit to 1 notebook only. Stupid decision without thinking long term 😂. You want lifetime customers not every year please pay me customer. Lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the last 2-3 weeks I am losing a lot of notes. I write and then i notice the app says it is checking for updates. When it does that the whole note gets lost. what is with all the updates or whatever is going on? I have been thinking about changing for a while now and this unreliability is what is going to give me the final push to delete my account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this for years and loved it. However, recently the quality has been degrading. The ads are near constant, and now you're limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes for free accounts. There have also been formatting bugs that have gone unfixed for years, and the desktop app has been crashing more recently. Rather than adding useful features for paid users, they have decided to make the free experience as annoying as possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot open, read or export my notes because I see unclosable screen that requires subscription without option to continue use limited free version or just export my notes. Goodbye evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please, please, please stop trying to force a premium subscription down our throats. It's a really solid app, but y'all needa chill. I would gladly pay a one-time fee, but no way am I going to pay y'all monthly. If y'all are that down bad for money, just run an ad bar or something, sheesh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is a whole world of people (plumbers, electricians, chefs, trainers, inspectors etc) out there who use list over and over. This app is TERRIBLE for those people. No sorting options at all. No check/uncheck all, no delete all checked, I've checked repeatedly over the years for these upgrades and they don't seem to be forthcoming. Don't know if I'll keep checking, since the creators don't seem to care. Checked 112723, no improvement! Still, basic, basic, basic! And EXPENSIVE! Won't try again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for over 5 years as a reliable, free tool to take notes. Each year it seems like it becomes less useful as they add more ""updates"". For the user, it just makes the interface slower. Countless times I wait excruciatingly long for my notes to open, which defeats the purpose of writing notes on the fly. Only reason I use it now is for my legacy logs. This last update is the final straw as it limits you to only 50 notes for free users. Will be moving all my notes & uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm promoted to upgrade to the paid plan every single week. Free plan is going to be limited to 50 notes. After years of using this app and the experience worsening every year I'm just going to switch to Google docs. Good riddance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have shown me your ads so many countless times that I will never ever purchase your app, but will still use it forever for free and will give 1 star in every possible platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm vary happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was really good until they updated it, now it's completely useless unless you pay almost $80 a year. I had to switch notes app because of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would be great if not for the incessant ads to pay for the damn thing that are difficult to get off my screen when I'm out and about trying to just get a list open. Terrible when I don't have good connection as well. Frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best app to keep your notes and information safe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very basic note taking app that tries to look fancy. Free version offers the absolute bare minimum to be considered a note taking app while the paid version is WAY too expensive for services that would come standard in other note taking apps. The worst part is how unoptimized the app itself is especially considering just how much you're paying. The app CONSTANTLY crashes on my phone, tablet and PC and shows no sign of improvement anytime soon. You're better off just sticking to pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I see one more screen blocking promotion to buy the premium I will def stop using it. The push for paid is just exhausting. If that's your goal - to pressing your users into paying, it's not going to work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The addition of tasks management made this a great tool to organize my life, it is great at capturing new info, displaying pics and GIFs ... but the widget is clunky (doesn't update, despite all updates showing in the app). For a paid app they needed to step up their game but others have walked away with what once was their crown."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was tremendous but now, this is totally wastes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great App!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app that I've used for over a decade, recently went for the paid version. However, it still has a few bugs that are frustrating. Given I'm a paying user, please fix this!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has become my constant companion for storing all my notes, articles and reminders."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot recommend this app. I used its free plan for 10 years to store thousands of documents from my writing hobby, most of which are under half a megabyte. With a recent update, I am now limited to 50 documents, and one folder. Total. I can't make more. If there was a storage size limit like Dropbox or Google Drive, I'd accept it. But the app is now completely unusable to me. I won't be paying a subscription, and I intend to uninstall it. Don't waste your time, like I did."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"WHY DOES THE APP just HANG at the wrong time?!?!?! And this is not just one occasion but multiple occasions that I've seen this happen on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used Evernote often and this year is having big crash problems when login and edit and even copied text please fix asap and which not happy because I am subscriber"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since 2013 but today I have deleted my account and moved to Google Keep. Basic note keeping should not be difficult. Few recent updates have made the app super slow and unstable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really like this app and have used it for over 10 years. My only problems are the widgets that seem buggy and I have had to stop using them. If you could please update the widgets? I'm on Samsung devices. Many thanks 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My active stylus doesn't work in the app (Lenovo precision pen 2). The app is laggy on my Lenovo P11 pro gen 2. The subscription is way too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly bothering me with ""special offers"" for the premium plans. Used to be good but now practically unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update 11/2023 This used to be one of my most beloved tools but the recent updates have just left me confused. Why do I need to be connected the internet to view notes which were once saved on my phone? Why do reminders no longer work? Why do I manually have to make notes ""off-line"" when they used to automatically offline so before? Apps don't need to be always online to be good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crashes all the time now. Hitting the back button closes the app. Notes constantly don't save after you update them. It'll say it was submitted and saved and then I go back later and the updates are all gone. Trying to copy and paste anything just deletes it and there is no option to undo the deletion and get it back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's fine, but every single time I open the app, I have to click through like 3 ""special offers"" to upgrade to pro. Settle down Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great organization and collaborational tool for the most part, but I've been using them for about 8 years now both the paid version and the free. I've learned that the paid version isn't any more valuable to me and I operate multiple businesses and utilize many notes. They're getting a one-star because Ive reached out multiple times to inquire about removing myself from a shared note so it doesn't show up anymore, and they haven't even tried to answer my inquiry. No customer service to call."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please stop trying to ram your paid service down our throats. Also please address your ""public forum"" of support it is vastly useless and hugely full of offensive trolls... evernotes approach seems to be how little can we do for our users and how much money can we squeeze from them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Don't use it very much, so I'm not really sure about this review. I don't understand why it updates so often. Sometimes twice a week."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Please improve your app, I think notion doesn't have as many bugs as Evernote. But I want to continue with you, please 🥺 improve it!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user from 2012 until today. I opened the app this morning and was met with 3 back to back full screen pop-ups for the subscription plan. It seemed there was a timer on closing them as it wouldn't close them immediately when I hit X. I can't take it anymore. If you're so desperate for free users to be on a subscription plan then just make the app subscription only. The free parts of the app hardly work as is. I've deactivated my account and migrated to Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting an upgrade offer every time it opens, which I have to triple confirm to close killed the usability of this service. Looking for an alternative to migrate to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update Don't even let me use the note. Ask for the subscription all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years, but I have finally had enough. This will be another case study of a business with a leading position that was ruined by greed and poor management. The app is just too slow and buggy, and the constant price increases have become too much. You don't own the market any more, there are plenty of other alternatives with much better pricing. Learn that lesson before it is too late."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use the software all the time to organise my life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this every day for writing ideas, then they changed it to an absurdly expensive pricing model, and limited it to 50 notes for the free version. Goodbye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy on Android and they don't fix bugs often. Sketching, which is a critical feature for me, simply doesn't work on Android. Highlighting text and replacing doesn't work. It's at the point where this app is unreliable on Android mobile devices. I've used this app for many years and it feels like it's becoming a dead app at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time user (free and sometimes premium) and considered this the best note app ever. However, the recent change to the free plan - i.e. 1 notebook and 50 notes limit - made me think otherwise. Looking for a new app that can fill this gap. Might stick to Evernote if they bring back the previous free plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote maybe a decade. I used the free version mainly for lists and web links I wanted to save and some memories i wanted to keep. The premier subscription pop-up will not allow me to open anything. Every time I do anything it comes back up. So I signed up for the free trial, got everything I needed, canceled my subscription, and deleted the app. There are plenty of decent, free apps that work without the glitches in this app lately. It used to be so great. Such a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"back button doesn't play nice with pixel 8"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be an awesome app. It is now next to useless, with no ability to contact anyone for assistance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow to load. The incredibly aggressive pushing for you to subscribe to premium makes it utterly useless for on the spot note taking. By the time you've confirmed for the third time that you do not want to pay for the privilege of jotting something down, you've forgotten what you wanted to write anyway."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Dear Evernote, If I can & want to subscribe to your product, I will. The sale offer that you force me to close, then confirm that I want closed, EVERY time I open your app, & sometimes randomly using the app, is not only irritating, but can cause the entire app to freeze, forcing me to shut it down & losing whatever I was working on. If you want ppl to subscribe, this is the wrong way to do it. After this review, the ads stopped for a bit. Then I lost my phone. Just got 2 ads in a row."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"5 stars to one star. Been using Evernote since 2012. I have about 500 notes on here. I've tried the premium twice, but the benefits were never worth the price. Now I get the auto update for the latest version & it says I am capped at 1 notebook and 50 notes. Imagine back in 2012 taking away a feature from a free app to try to wrangle you into spending 100$ for what you already had! I hope everyone jumps ship."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just use Google Docs. I've been using Evernote for years but over time the attempts to monetize the app have become unbearable. On startup it'll spam you with a couple attempts to purchase a premium plan. Over time you'll eventually come to a point where you can no longer create new notes because you'll have to pay. I use this on both PC and Mobile and today was the breaking point. I'm just going to use Google Docs to keep my scripts, important info, etc. Evernote is useless pay to use trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"There are a ton of random bugs that make it annoying to use. Everything from editing to just simply navigating the app is a pain. It also keeps asking me to upgrade which I really don't want to do, especially knowing all the bugs it has"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App on mobile and desktop has really degraded in the last 2 years. Been using it almost 10. Attempting to scroll a note will constantly close it. Can't do strikethrough as conveniently. They beg for premium sign ups all the time. Takes forever to load sometimes for no reason. Tasks can take a long time to load too and are somewhat unintuitive to put in, have syncing issues. This used to be a simple, fast, efficient app. Now there is too much fluff that does nothing for productivity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"horrible,unusable and keeps sending warnings of my password being hacked by theirs nothing i can do without paying for at least 1 month service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Well, time to find a new notes app. Such a shame. You're now limited to a mere 50 NOTES. Yup, they've just killed their business lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like the app and have used it for many years but it keeps crashing on my z-fold 5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New rule: no more >50 notes on the free version. Hate new rules. Will move to another fair solution from here."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using it on and off since 2017, it's super laggy, it bombards you with ads and ""one time"" offers to upgrade that appear every time, and now the PC version is limited to 50 notes only; that's my final straw, I'm quitting this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best Note on for Android device ever seen? Kudos"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost all my 3 years notes after app asked to change password. Cannot recover at all. Just waist money for 3 years subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My original review in 2014 was 5 stars. Over the last 3-4 months, Evernote is now deleting many of my saved notes (note appears, but everything typed in the note is deleted). Now, as of today (11/24/23),they want me to pay over $100 a year to make new notes (to have over 50 notes). I have used them for 11+ years, and now they want to charge me for a product that is worse than a decade ago? I WILL NOT USE EVERNOTE ANYMORE AFTER 11+ YEARS OF USE! THEY USED TO BE THE GOLD STANDARD, NOW JUST A JOKE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Enough (free) features to earn it for out of 4/5 But charging for some key features, features that I believe should be free... 3/5 If this app was completely free it would be 5 out of 5 one of the best apps I've ever used"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"11/2023 updated review: still SUCKS. idk how they sleep at night knowing they took a great app and made it useless. 2021 review: Terrible since March. If you haven't been using it for years already, DON'T start now. I have to find a new app. Takes forever to open even just a text note from the notes list. It's just text--just OPEN already!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""1 notebook, 50 notes"" in the free version? BYE BYE Evernote. They don't state that in the deal, the paid versions are too expensive, and not worth it. I've been using this app for years, I had +20 notebooks, and hundreds of notes, but this ""free version change"" was the last straw, it won't let me edit anything anymore., I'm migrating elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whenever I use the back gesture it closes the app instead of just going back to the main screen. App is now unusably slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"WAS GREAT. All of a sudden I, apparently need to pay like 100 a year if I still want to use it. Bummer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Looks like Evernote decided to lose the last loyal users. Putting features that used to be free behind the paywall and bombarding users with annoying popups won't get you paid subscriptions, it will make people leave. After a few years of this 💩, they've come up with an ultimate failure move leaving only 1 notebook & 50 notes in the free plan, which is a slap in the face for old users. I can't even move notes between my existing notebooks anymore. After 10 years, goodbye Evernote, hello Notion!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"While I appreciate the security features that Evernote provides, their constant pestering about signing up for premium has finally made me switch to OneNote. My device lags because Evernote wants to tell me about a deal that certainly won't be offered to me again! Only for another offer to smack me in the face the next time I open the app. Please, I'm begging you, I only want the free features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why limited the number of notes I can create every month?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to have a paid version for a couple of years, but at some point cancelled the subscription. Doesn't work well in offline mode (the main reason I switched to the paid version), and pretty buggy. Last weeks there were loads of nag screens, and now I can't even create a new note as they've limited it to 50 noted for the free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has basically become unusable in the past twelve months. Constant sync problems, and the widget is now unusable and doesn't update unless you open the main app and... wait. Pointless. Technical support haven't responded to the ticket going on six months. Depressing stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constant prompts to go to the paid version were kind of expected. Today I tried you use it and two things became clear to me. They want me gone because they have limited both the number of notebooks and notes in the free version to a point that it's just a trial now. And second, their pricing is ridiculous. I would gladly pay for the product over free, but not the prices that they are asking. Looking at a 3 year cost, it is what I have paid for a full version of Microsoft Office before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for, I don't remember how long now, more than 10 years and loved it. But recent changes and constant upgrade ads are annoying. Not to mention, I'm now being told I'm limited to 1 notebook and 50 notes? I don't rely on it heavily, but it is definitely not enough for the $80 ""discounted"" cost. Ridiculous. I am looking at other options and most likely uninstalling very soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They got greedy. You can now only have 50 notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am not giving any star because I have used it more than 5 years , and before few days my internet is ON and open the ever note application so application gets crash and opened in another account with same email address so my all 5 years data are lost now.so Ever note team please help me out from this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good productivity tool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I get the need to make money. But limiting how many notes you can make before you have to get a subscription? That's gross. I have 11 active notes on my account, I cleared my trash, but I have to pay to make more notes because I've reached 50 total? I liked this app a lot and used it purely for organizing notes & lists, but I gotta go. Mainly because I can't use the app anymore, but also because free users shouldn't have a note limit. I'm not paying $80/year minimum for a note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a long time user, and I was surprised this morning to find out that the app is effectively behind a pay wall (overnight). And it's a very high pay wall. I'm a former paid user, but the price is unreasonable now. If you don't already use this app, don't start!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2012. Once easy to use, smooth and fast the app has become a collection of useless features, unfriendly, bulky with ads popping up so often. Such a pity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been a user of the app for several years, had 100+ notes, then suddenly blocked me from ""creating more than 50 notes"" unless I subscribe. Left for Notion and do not regret the move. PS: tried to remove my account and the remove account page ""fails""....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The Evernote App is not working properly. This very frustrating as I have used it for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a reliable notes app, years ago. Now, it fails to even function more often than not. Crashes frequently. The cherry on top is that now it requires a premium subscription to even use. Absolutely garbage app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, now totally unusable. If I open it right now I'll get the client debug mode error 3 times and it will close. I used it for years and now I have to get all my notes out so I can uninstall. It's mind boggling that they pressure you to pay for upgrade... for a totally broken product. edit: now even worse. if you try to search for a note, they plaster an offer for premium which persists until the app closes. Useless app. Maybe hire some actual programmers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for a long time, but recently it started giving me pop ups every single time I opened it asking me if I want to upgrade and then telling me when I select no that the offer is one time only. Over and over and over again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Baru sync 3 kali, dh disuruh bayar. Ingtkan free sentiasa."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"their security is awful. my account has been hacked multiple times despite password changes and 2fa. hacker disabled my 2fa without having access to my email. I don't have any sensitive information on my account luckily"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Amazing...very useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Speed / performance has improved significantly in the past couple of months, both on mobile and web."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Productivity and functionality? Down. New features no one asked for? Yes. Subscription price? Way, way, way up. Cherry on top: informing me of the huge (300% for me) price increase during Black Friday week, then going on their website, seeing a supposed 40% discount for Black Friday, but finding that it's impossible to redeem. Evernote? More like EverNOPE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app for free! Helps keep me organised and it's a place to keep notes. Would be better if they didn't ask me every single time to upgrade to premium and pretend like it's the last time that the offer will be available..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app's passcode gets disabled when there's an offer popup."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've loved this app for a long time, but now it doesn't even save my changes to notes half the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to allow you to have their app on 2 devices, evidently they only allow you to have it on one device unless you pay them $129.99. I will only use it on one device and look for something similar so I don't have to pay for something that I only use for recipes and password retention."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Best app I made sure to install EVERYWHERE!!! But 10 years later ??? SMH developers... EPIC FAIL!!! Sure you lost the majority of your users... see ya around clown."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Their lack of security has rendered it unuseable. In the last month, 8 different people from around the world have been able to access my account. They are all using Skitch for Android, an Evernote program. I do not have Skitch myself. Changing my password multiple times has not worked. I tried to delete my account but it won't accept my password and all of a sudden won't let me reset it again. I assume people are using it to access other stuff on my phone now. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It does what it promises. As a writer, this is all I use when I'm not at my desk and it works like a charm. I'd love to have a grammar or spell check (...) Edit:new update made the app slow to load in notes despite it being an online service that doesn't store notes locally, the scrolling still sucks but now it actually bugs out and closes the app. (...) Edit 2mnths later:Clicked save, changed apps, went back to note - lost 1hr amount of work :) looks like this app is gone for good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not a fan of recent version change. It says I can have up to 50 notes, but now won't let me make a new note despite only having 20. Seems like the purpose is to push users to another platform, so that stinks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't download, the apps lags a lot, is not flexible at all. I would suggest use Google Docs instead, it's wayyyy better than this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow and laggy, don't bother. Looking for alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not work anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have not been able to access the app in well over a month. I can login or gain access to what I had on it. This is frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated to the latest version for Android 10. It keeps on pushing for an upgrade stating that you have too many synced devices and never lets you do anything else. While it allows you to remove the abovementioned devices, it never lets you disconnect them properly. ie, the screen where you do that does not seem to have a confirmation button when prompted to confirm your choice. Therefore you get stuck forever and never get to use the app at all. A waste of time. Very bad design. Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been a long term user of the free version of the app, and just now i thought a calculator integrated nicely in this will help others as well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Tortured with updates LITERALLY EVERY DAY. MADNESS! Don't you hear your customers?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting worse every day...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant demands to upgrade that lie about it ""being a one time offer"" despite offering the same thing every single day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another sad example of greed and stupidity ruining what used to be a great piece of software. I've been using Evernote since 2012, and in the past few years they have managed to destroy the program. Slow, buggy, reduced functionality, ads all the time, and a truly bloated and unreasonable price tag. I will be switching to OneNote, and I recommend everyone find another note taking program. You do not want to support a company who has such little respect for its customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A year later and this app is riddled with multiple ads for its own premium version. Spent 5 minutes on here editing information and ran into 4 ads. I'll be looking for a replacement note keeping app soon. This is ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years but it's become unstable and reliable. I've lost 5 notes that I spent hours working on. I even paid for the premium just to get support because it isn't free apparently and it's been a month with 0 responses. It just seems like they don't care anymore. I loved this app but at this point it's become unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am a premium customer. I can open the app but it crashes when I attempt to open my notes on my Samsung Galaxy Tab S7."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slow with the new version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was always auto saving whatever written ..now it started being confused to save the notes also makes note duplication! In fact it has started lately to save without the written data.. i think you need to look at this seriously. Considering you were a reliable App for many years of good reputation!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable due to bugs and storage of a high amount of copies of notes, very slow. Used to be way better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The full screen ads are very intrusive and they make it difficult to close. On top of that they are appearing more and more often. I am going to start looking at a new cloud-based note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good for many years I recommend to many . But now days noted are not getting saved. I lost valuable daily update notes from 10th to 20th of this month . Tried reopening many tiems. My internet is good and fast. Still I am not getting my data. So stopping using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"An awesome note app! You can do audio and even upload videos and pictures and create tasks with due dates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Notes fail to save sometimes resulting in data loss: I've considered whether I would pay for this app, but after all these years, the basic saving and syncing feature is still unreliable. I'm only using one device but somehow I will get conflicts and data loss on notes I've updated from time to time. It's really unacceptable for this type of app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Good day ❤️☺️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using evernote for my business for almost 7 years and it is vital part of our operation from task management to client notes to monthly/quarterly deadlines etc. Thank you for the great product and continue to innovate!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Charging for a note pad. It came free with workbench, Nokia's windows... Filthy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but this constant add popping up trying to get me to pay is RIDICULOUS. Used to be such a good app what happened?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Over the last 7 years this app, in terms of performance, has done nothing but get substantially worse each year. Notes don't get synced properly and conflicts happen too often. The app runs terribly on any mobile device with excellent hardware. These issues did not exist years ago but over the last 3 years has really started to go downhill. Evernote is otherwise a brilliant app for note-taking and list-making but is constantly marred with its crippling issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is not free anymore. Added Notes count limit. It is the end of an era. I'm using since 2012. Now forced to use new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for over a year now but currently I can't even login to see my messages inside it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Clicking through a TWO STEP annoying upgrade ad on every use is obsurd, including a fake warning that I'll never get the discount offer again is aggressive and a waste of time. I have sometimes actually forgotten why I was going to use the app by the time I figure out how to click through these. I wish it were easy to import my extensive recipe notes into a competing app, but apparently that's a purposeful hurtle to trap me -- lock me into this hell."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app tries to offer users ease to take and access notes, yet undercuts its primary use case by showing full page ad for its premium subscription, EVERY SINGLE DAY."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app I have ever seen. The data are keep erased without any action. I added 2 notes only but one note already deleted itself and another the notes I wrote is missing after every 3 days. I don't know how to retrieve my notes too now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"非常に使いやすいノートアプリ。無料でも2端末まで使えるためずっと使わせていただいてます。最近は課金への誘導がちょっと多すぎるかなw"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As everyone else has said, the app is incredibly buggy now (even on premium.) Load times have increased substantially, and I often have to close the app and reopen just to get it to work properly on startup. I lost a whole note today for some odd reason. This was the final straw for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What happened Evernote? An upsell ad Everytime I open the app? A home page that takes up a ton of screen space to show me a customizable banner and a ""Good evening, [name]"" message. Just show me my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not download!!! Warning! This app is insecure and constantly demands $$$"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Working together on one file often creates multiple versions with no one truth anymore. Promotes paid accounts too often. It's just a notes app, why should I pay? Edit: officially done with this app. It keeps copying my notes. On top of that it just erased all my tasks and I can't recover them. And I still don't want to upgrade! I don't want to see that ad everytime I open my shopping list."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I rely on this app but routinely find sync issues between the mobile and desktop apps. I have to be extremely attentive to make up for content that falls through the cracks. Productivity often happens in spite of this app and the amount of hand-holding I have to do to get notes to load with their most recent changes in tact."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best Beeesssttttt"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful aap for students, easy to cary, easy to compile, very user friendly, verity of options to diversify & segregate your content. I personally found it very useful and using since May-2020. But there are some points to be improved like giving more separate sub notes within the notes in a particular notebook. And option to convert it into pdf formate... Because it sometimes we need our own notes to be zeroxed. Thanks team evernote. 😊👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Transferring your data from one device to another is very easy with this app. You just have to log in on another device and there you go. Ease with this app is what I Love."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It signed me up without my consent or knowledge using wrong information."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"this app was very wrong to have increased the annual charge a LOT to me. a paid user of over 10years. made me look into some other apps. and i found one. the new owner of the evernote had done something very silly. now it tried to make me go back to use the app again. but i didnt see the price is low enough. while i have been building up my new habit on using the new app. never irritate the good long time paying customers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for 10 years. They nerfed the free version and more than doubled the paid subscription. Nope. I am done. You guys are CRAZY if you think people are going to pay $80 at the sale price for a note app. EVERY YEAR."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used and loved it for many years, however the new version is near unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had to open a second account because my first account inexplicably stopped working on my phone, and I couldnt access support without paying additional for the service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Glitchy, with annoying ads. The sketching barely functions, and it even once deleted an elaborate and important note I was in the middle of writing, which is utterly unacceptable for a note-taking app. Over the years they've steadily increased the frequency of the pop-ups and push notifications advertising their premium edition, to the point that the app now feels super trashy. Pick a different note taker."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A recent update has solved most of my issues with the app. It's got a super clean user interface and stores all my files well. The free version has previously given me issues, but from what I can tell they're gone and to top it off it now looks beautiful too. Many thanks to the developers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good..!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Asking for premium subscription for cash... its not a free app now waste of time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Guys, don't install this junk. I kept getting emails about logins to my account from different Asian countries every single week and from different devices. Finally I closed this piece of junk."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesn't work more than half of the time on my Moto G Stylus 5G 2022. On attempt to save a web clip it says ""Stay on this screen"" and the circle keeps turning. The save never gets completed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Hi! What's going on with your app??? I didn't want to update the app, but I mistakenly deleted the app in my phone so I had to reinstall it. Ever since I reinstalled it few weeks ago, I haven't been able to access my note. Before, I could access my note offline.But now, whether offline or online, I can not see my notes and I can note make new notes. Must I pay before I am able to see my note or/and even type new ones??? Please fix this. I tried typing new review, but I didn't see where to do it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful experience! If I could give negative stars I would. I am lividly angry. I have not used evernote in over 5 years. Again this year I recieved no notification that my subscription was to be automatically renewed. My account was automaticlly debited again for a product I will never use. This is disgusting behaviour. There is no email address for support. The chat function is unavailable. Cancelling is convoluted. This company are a pack of thieves. I want my money back. NOW!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote used to be my favourite app since 2013, but now I hate using it as it has become unbearably slow. And that's on my Samsung Note 9 with 128 GB of storage! As a former software engineer myself, I think the Evernote CEO and Tech Leads should be ashamed of what they have done to what was a truly wonderful and groundbreaking app. In case anyone is interested, I have switched to Microsoft OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I m enjoying it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i love how easy it is to write notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From ¥ 0 to ¥ 9300 per year, it's quite a jump guys. Maybe a one time purchase, or a lighter version around ¥3 -4000 per year....Your offer excludes a lot of people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new version is terrible. What a crapy upgrade. Why did they move away from the legacy version? Bad move, I hate the new version. I am going to find a way to export my notes and cancel my subscription. Fail Evernote! My images on older notes not loading..fail!! The more I use it, the more I hate it. Regret paying the 1yr subscription this year."

Evernote helped me deal with my dad's especially complicated estate one year, and I paid for the deluxe package, knowing I could normally rely on the free package for everyday stuff. They do have the right to change their products. This has left a very sour taste in my mouth, and I will be finding somewhere else to keep my notes *due to the lack of transparency & integrity*."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need an account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The new update is horrible! You can only use 1 notebook and create 50 notes! I use this app to journal daily and I am sure that they have already used that data to train their own AI and now that they are done with the training they have decided to lock the gates to the zoo, release the tigers and lions, and charge people for an exit ticket! I just wish there was a separate plan for the lighter users of this app who use Evernote instead of Gdrive to take just notes."

App closes unexpectedly whenever I try to navigate back a screen, and now it has constant paywalls. Good if you don't mind a subscription. I already use a note app that fits my needs, so a paywall would be a strict downgrade. 👎 2015 Shopping lists, ideas, reminders, this app is like having a good memory. App syncs across devices. I realize I only use like 1/4th it's features. It would deserve 6/5 stars if they added color themes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since I don't know when. And it starts crashing as hell and the note conflicts drive me mad.

If you write text in unicode , then select some words and delete, then Evernote deletes selected words and selected number of characters after it (yes, it deletes what you have not selected)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Expensive - they're almost doubling the price of the Personal subscription (which was already expensive) to $120/year. Meanwhile the app has become less usable and doesn't work consistently offline, which is one of the features you pay for. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is unreliable. I use Evernote for file keeping (pdf) for personal use. With new interface, the performance become bad & the pdf files saved as attachment are difficult to view even if I manage to open it."

I have been using Evernote since 2012 I just realized. I've told Evernote things that I haven't told any human. It's been a therapist, a dream keeper, and magic time capsule, and more over the past 11 years. But now, I think I need to find something else. The old and real/true Evernote doesn't exist anymore.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app is garbage once you sign up it will not let you log in garbage. I will not install this app again or pay for it out of $130 you guys are crazy. There is no way that an app is going to take my money and use it and not let me use their app."

At first it would come back after some days but it's taking longer or not at all. All my hard work down the drain....I still use it only because I haven't found an app I like.... so I have to hope for the best each time I write. I'll probably go back to notebooks and pen soon..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been on Evernote since 2011. So dissapointed lately. First of all it is slow in loading notes when it does load. It is losing photos I shot and added while editing the note. Photo is visible in the preview/thumbnail of the note on the homescreen, bit not in the itself. Is not showing content of simple notes with only text and links, having to close the app, restart phone, etc. to get to see the content. Horrible experience, looking in to switching to alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App wouldn't let me disconnect previous devices and keeps me stuck with the only option of upgrading in order to keep previous devices connected."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app was fine it recommended to me and at first I was very impressed, although it takes a while to load my notes so I can't imagine if I have tons of notes, I'd also like if we can have more shades for the highlighter, and lastly I'm on mobile and the sketch tool doesn't work like the ink doesn't load or save. As I read the pass reviews I can say this is a common problem with your app."

Notes won't open 90% of the time and I need to close and reopen the app to get them to work, sometimes up to 3 times. It's funny how it prompts for paid subscriptions every time I open the app because you couldn't pay me to keep using it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It gets worse. It just lost an entire note after i saved it. 😠 Jan-23: Constant synchronisation problems between devices. Frequent problems selecting text on android mobile. This app has regressed so much."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"AFTER hiking the price and releasing updates that made the app sluggish and nearly inoperable, Evernote has now also limited free users to 1 notebook and 50 notes.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like Evernotes a lot. I've been a 10yr member. My only current complaint is that this app Unlocks my SCREEN ROTATION 👎🏽, which I otherwise keep locked in portrait mode. I hate a screen that rotates when I don't want it to.

I don't have more than 2 devices attached to the software .... even when I try to use the option to exit another device, it does not let me .... this is a total scam! Extortionate app!

If you have money to upgrade this app then install it or either DON'T INSTALL!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the app for over a decade, but unfortunately over the past year, it's become unusable. I used it to take notes, journal, plan goals, write business ideas, keep important information, store research from online sources, etc. Those tasks consume a big part of my life and Evernote made it all possible for so long. It was just so convenient, refined, and the ability to search all documents was amazing. UNFORTUNATELY: the app no longer works. I've used hundreds of hours to migrate now."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"As per Notes and productivity it's the G.o.at But as per newer mobile version it's a trashy experience, the home page and the navigation ui is too cluttered and confusing and the back button takes you staright to home menu even if I was in notebook section and if I have somehow quit from the app while relaunching it just can't open back and stucked at Evernote logo, The web version is so smooth and better than mobile version."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be the best app but they've updated it and made it virtually unusable.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has gone from being one of my favourite and reliable apps (initially gave a 5star review in 2016) to something I now must find a replacement for.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The android version keeps crashing, whatever I do. On my Samsung Note 8, on my Samsung Note 10+. Whatever I do. Is that the result of you dubling the subscription price?! On Windows I'm still using the legacy version. At least it works. I'm using it since well over 10 years now (2011 october 16). I'm at more than 55000 notes. I never got any reaction to my critics from your side. You just don't care. I can't recommend Evernote to anybody. 12 years of work lost. A one-way trap :-("

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had no idea that Evernote had fallen over. I had an important letter to draft and as usual opened it up and tapped in some ideas.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use this app everyday until they became super aggressive and intrusive with ads and paywalls and now limiting us to 50 notes.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Amazing for an entire decade - LOST MY BUSINESS! Not a major monthly user but maybe 4-6 notes/month. Having a single notebook and 50 note limit is absurd. Will be moving all data and will never use this app again. Don't waste your time or money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly Evernote WAS the talk of the town Everyone used it. 4.50 for middle tier, 7.95 fior the highest. Now it's 7.95 WEEKLY Most importantly, there are now so many glitches that EN NEVER had.

UpFront notes is a good try"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using it for a few years, works fine as a basic note app (I have the free version). When I have a note open all the text randomly disappears fairly often, and I have to hard close the app several times and wait a minute just to be able to read the note again. Also get ads to upgrade to paid premium constantly. Will probably start using different app as soon as I take the time to find another one."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for a decade. I have long said that Evernote is my memory: if it's not on Evernote, it's not in my brain. Recently, they have slashed free plan usage to an astonishingly low 50 NOTES ON A SINGLE DEVICE. This is a death blow to most Evernote users. I'll be taking my note organization needs to Microsoft OneNote."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been an Evernote user since 2011. With the free version. After the recent update, I'm being forced to upgrade with the constant pop-up. According to the online information, a free account has 100,000 notes. I have screenshots stating so! Now, the app says 1 notebook with 50 notes. I have under 200 notes. Fortunately, this means I will be switching to another platform and moving my notes there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not sure what's going on. I've had this app since 2011/2012. Every new phone I get, it's one of the first apps I install. Lately, the notes I type are not saving. The intrusive ads to buy the premium plan is far more frequent than it used to be. Hopefully things can improve but if not, I will have to move on to another app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was once the best app. Now they business has gone down so bad that they keep pumping popup in the app asking you to subscribe. I was once premium user, now I hate it so much that I wouldnt want to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With the new owner the value of the app has gone down. Prices increased. It has become worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Going to switch to another Note taking app (free and open-source). Evernote is super unreliable, and slow. They need to hire better coders if they want to keep milking the cashcow. The price is also ridiculous for an app that works half the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't believe after all these years it still fails to sync properly/reliably and it still loses my notes sometimes. It's embarrassing. Revisiting in 2023. Still loses my notes. Real thought and time, just poof. Gone. It's always been very buggy, on all platforms. Now it'll ask you to upgrade every other day. They never fix their bugs, they only add unwanted features (causing more bugs) I'm looking for an alternative I hate evernote so so much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes if unsynced will be lost upon installation of the latest update. It just happened to me. I don't even know what 'unsynced' means. As an unpaid user I don't get local storage option by definition. I never lost a note in 12 years of using Evernote for not syncing and otherwise. It never occurred to me notes could be left unsynced. Something has gone horribly wrong my dear developers"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Badest notes taking app in the world 😡😡😡🤬"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No option to lock screen rotation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This is the content of my email to App Support:  I have been using the EVERNOTE free version since 2014.         I used it at 11am today and ALL MY NOTE BOOKS WERE IN PLACE         When I re-opened Evernote less than an hour later, my 3 years worth of documents were all GONE           I noticed , for the 1st time EVER, a statement about ""22 days left before a reset , max 60mb""         So, what is this NEW RESET THING ABOUT?         Is that why all my documents are GONE?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for like 10 years now and it's getting more and more overpacked with unnecessary things which slow down the main function which is note taking. Many errors occur and while editing a note, some conflicting copies are created so it gets sooo messy. I'm currently looking for an alternative because it's frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a good all until they put a cap on the devices enabled for free users. Now I can only write either on my mobile or laptop, can't be logged in on both at the same time. This is quite a hassle. Maybe you can turn some ads on but please keep atleast 2 devices enabled for free users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Randomly Deletes Text in Notes: Zero Recovery Options I've used note apps everyday for 10 years and never had a problem. Started using evernote, and twice in the first six months, it's randomly deleted the full body of important notes; all but the tittle. This wouldn't be an issue if there was a hard set undo option like Microsoft Word. The irony of Evernote is that rather than ever more having your notes, you may ever more regret the day you chose to use them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The amount of intrusive ads to upgrade your subscription are just horrible. I've been using Evernote for over a decade, and I never imagined I would ever hate it. I can't stand using the Evernote app anymore. Every other time I open it, I get a hard stop to upgrade. Absolute garbage!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Waste app.. Server connection issues"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the app for several years and I pay for premium but I'm finding it increasingly buggy and will have to abandon it soon if it doesn't get better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashes on opening a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is extremely unreliable, it will randomly lose your notes and duplicate them. It's buggy and often won't load notes. I like the UI and I wish it worked properly, but it has let me down too many times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm choosing not to do the upgrade this app and you all have blocked me from my work on this app, I would like to remove all of my work PLEASE tell me how I can get to my work to transfer it somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Love the app except that it keeps crashing when exiting and opening a new note, please fix the issue for z fold's"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very disappointed. I have had a paid membership for years but recently wanted to access some older notes (eg 10 yrs old), some being voice recordings of my dad before he passed away, and they are no longer accessible. It's like older notes just get deleted without any notification. Shame on you Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very perfect to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was my favourite app before but now saving is a basically based on luck. I have lost so much notes on it because because it can't save even when I do everything properly. Looking for an alternative app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Am not able to use it efficiently as compared to the the previous one. It keeps on asking for my credit card for payment plan,and then goes back to the phone page."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I had been using the app since July 2020, and it helped me through my senior year of high school (2020-2021). Now with the recent undate I had to put a cork in my editing process so I can look for a new app. I am not paying $130(+tax) per year so I can keep using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am a paying member of Evernote as I have several thousand notes. Am transitioning off the platform as it crashes too much and I lose notes often. Especially if one starts writing a note but doesn't save before switching windows. This is not the Evernote of 5 years ago. It got bought by a company who doesn't seem to be maintaining the notes anymore. The addition of AI search is a worrisome addition too as one must wonder if the new owners goal is to make you pay by mining your notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Amazing. The app gets worse every year and more expensive too. Now it freezes half the time I want to write a note. If you aren't stuck on this platform, recommend one try an alternative or a task manager that can do journaling"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too slow; delete note button is too far. Annoying discount advertisement pop ups that blocking from fast note creating. Design is good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user for well over a decade. I have paid for the premium features, but as of now, the app is useless. I can't even log into it. After the first unsuccessful attempt, all I see is the green elephant 🐘. I am so disappointed. I used to promote this app as if it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but now... ☠️ DOA"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot open some notes, keep loading forever. Now only can load my existing note using web browser. My previous added image files all cannot rendered properly as well but still can see it using web browser."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is almost 2024, I pay money to Evernote for years but this app just delete one important note, one time m again and with information there that i can't recover. Don't come back to Evernote is not worth it anymore. I'm so frustrated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Glitchy interface on Pixel 6 pro, but otherwise does the job"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"too expensive. there are others."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Shocking free app now lost my stuff thats saved. Why my has the app disappeared on my phone tried to reinstall it and now wants a monthly payment no thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for awhile now, but it's becoming almost unusable with the pop up telling me to upgrade filling the whole screen I have to close before I can even jot anything down. The whole point was to have somewhere I can quickly get my thoughts down. It takes two clicks to close enough bc I have to say I'm not interested, and then also say 'I'm sure' the the next pop up telling me if I don't accept the offer it'll be gone forever (at this point I would love if it was truly gone forever)"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Overall rating does not reflect the current app. Used the free version for 6 yrs. Not perfect but very usable esp. as an interim way of organising information or for quick short term info. Update 10.54 (SEP 2023) causes mobile files to be internet only. So, very slow. No access in remote areas. NOW USELESS. The paid version also appears to have problems. Removed all files and deleting app. Bending Spoons took it over in Jan 23. 4 star to 1/2 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"just use your phones note app this app is garbage. runs way too hot for a note taking apps, i had my whole curriculum planned and half that file is gone. not reliable and can really screw you. and to think they want money ahahaha"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing for just about anything! school/work notes? you got all the tools. journalling? go wildly creative. to-do lists and anything else? go ahead. i cannot stress how comfortable both the app & pc program feels, they're quite literally amazing! i use evernote mostly for journalling, but it's pretty flexible in all areas too. would like some few things though ー the option to password-lock notes would be great for some more personal stuff, as well as the option to warp text around photos!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using since 2012, unfortunately the product has slipped significantly since. Can remember when the phone app wasn't buggy, and I'm not willing to switch away from the legacy app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow doubling the cost of subscription. Just lost my business"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Please just go back to the 2017 and before version. Ive had the paid version since far before that because I make alot of voice notes for music. Now this app is slow at startup searching, and saving.. plus i used to be able to make voice notes over an audio file as it played (I could play an instrumental and scat or sing lyrics over it within the app.) As all the reviewers agree... we dont need ya'll to keep making this thing more fancy, it was worthy to be paid for BEFORE for good reason!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Loyal Evernote customer since 2010, as they are still the best webclipper and note taker in the industry. Syncs across all my devices/ platforms. Sadly, I'm now switching to free because after years of price increases, at $130/ year it comically costs more than the entire Microsoft 365 suite (which includes OneNote). Would still be a happily paying customer if they brought back the inexpensive mid-tier option for users who don't want all the fancy features. Great app, and great customer service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notes stopped loading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Developers are continuing to improve the app ;mobile and desktop. I'm a user from the beginning and got very disappointed during the 2017, 2018 period when the software was radically altered becoming clunky and with many usefull features removed. I went to a two star review. since 2020 , the updates have massively improved the user experience, particularly syncing, clipping and speed of accessing notes. it is a much more seamless experience. hence I am again adjusting my review to 4 star"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very buggy. I use this app sparingly, but lately, it is terrible. Crashes often and no longer is the sketching functional."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i used the app since 2008., and it was probably the most loved app i have ever used; however, since 2020 it is horrible, extremely slow, almost not usable; some notes just disappear; some notes miss to sinchronize...; i am considering a migration to other app!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"👎🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the performance has really downgraded over the years, i have multiple times created a new note, either saved or not, changed apps, and uppn return, the whole note is missing or blank. extremely disappointed that this happened more than once. planning to change apps when i have the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to be a good app. Now it has tons of tech issues. I stopped my paid subscription. So many people complain but looks like Evernote's management went on vacation for good ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just had to pay for using this service. I don't mind paying but after paying it allowed me to use the app just for a while. Now its blocking me every type I do, even after paying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app since 2012. Do not update your free Evernote app! They will automatically limit you to 1 notebook with a max of 50 notes even though their advertisements don't disclose this limitation. This is no longer usable as a free app. My husband (paid evernote account) and I will be changing to another app ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for years. In the last couple days I cannot enter a new note because the keyboard disappears as soon as you start typing. Help!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You let me spend data to download this but you never mentioned that it costs money and is rather expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to really enjoy it until today. The keyboard will nolonger stay up in notes to type a note or edit a note. I have the same phone galaxy s10+"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Having a weird issue where my keyboard immediately closes while trying to edit a note, it's really frustrating, an iPhone user I know seems to be having the same issue as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2.49 a week absolute joke"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is how they thank their customers of nearly 15 years: by breaking the app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I write down ideas and when I come back, it is wiped out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use it every day but has audio bug...with latest update very unstable on Android. won't allow typing input"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is fine as long as you're willing to spend half of your earnings to actually use the locked 75% of this app. The free part of the app is nothing more than your standard notes app now. Free users got screwed over with the last update so I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is too slow, when I'm in edit mode the app keeps closing my keyboard so I'm unable to take notes on existing notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for over 10 years. Now? Constant data loss. Inexcusable. I will write a note. Save it. Close the app. Open the app, and my note is gone. This app is not only useless, but actively damaging to users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashing will not open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Time to leave. Been using the free tier since 2013. Was an excellent app, and I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 600 notes in 16 notebooks. Today I got the notification that I am only allowed one notebook with 50 notes, else upgrade to the paid version... $159.99/year! Are you mad?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app usually stops working when I try to open or start new notes. Not exactly helpful when that's the entire purpose of the app. It also randomly makes duplicates of notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's not free and doesn't give you permission to use all fields you want"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app from the start (2016 for me). It was great for everything! Checklists, rambling thoughts, jotting a quick note so I didn't forget a phone number, book title, etc. I used this app constantly. It's now completely unusable on all my devices. I use a free account (60mb storage; I'm at 1kb). It refuses to let me make anything new unless I upgrade to a paid account. Tap ""new note"", upgrade menu pops, I decline, right back to home. I've been getting past by editing previous notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horribly slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for a decade now but recent updates have made it unusable. Previously saved notes never load and I cannot take new notes at all. How am I supposed to access my notes now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"After the 8.10 version it became useless more and more with each and every update. I hope they make a classic version of the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Keeps creating multiple versions of the same note. Also doesn't scroll through noted, gets stuck with the first few and you're just scrolling and scrolling and getting nowhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"easy to use and very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used for years as it was good. But no longer has 2fa support, interface is clunky and often features don't work (like Empty Trash)"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Can't insert a sketch. When I try to insert, app locks up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible after it's been 'updated', simply impossible to use AT ALL: keeps shutting down as soon as I open it (which also takes ages). Android 13, on two different smartphones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely aggressive monetization scheme."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"takes time to sync between devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DISGUSTING 🤢"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's a great app but lags a lot and automatically keep rotating otherwise must recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Broken on Android...again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Where's the loading speed? Is been already few years, still didn't modify the system fast like before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"New Design and most of all usability is bad.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like more the legacy version, especially for Windows."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be the best regarding note-taking but the app has become bloated and slow. The competition has catched up big time. The price is too high now and the free tier is extremely restrictive. It's one thing to add the inconvenience of logging in each time but a whole another thing to allow 2 devices and permit only 2 device changes per month. If you want to use web clipping and offline mode on desktop, you just exhausted your options on a single device. Bad practice, sorry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Duplicate notes are getting created often and sync issues are making me lose my mind. Kindly fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This is a good app. I have used it for myself years to capture my thoughts, but there are two things which annoy me. The back button is broken. When I type back, closer the note. Do not close the app Don't ask me to upgrade every time I open the app. You are just encouraging me to use Google drive more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since 2012 and it was great, but they recently revamped the app and the new version is horrible. I've had saved notes disappear, even while actively using them. I've also had a half dozen copies of notes suddenly appear. The app isn't as streamlined as before and is much more difficult to navigate. It's also slow, as many others have said. I'm switching to a different app. This one sucks now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Avoid at all cost! Loads of things are always broken, support are rude and never fix anything, they update their app frequently, which always breaks new things, it mangles your notes, the search feature is useless, and OMG the price!!! They spend NOTHING on making their app work, yet charge us utterly obscene prices to use it, which they put up (by more than double!) *often*. Find anything else - I guarantee you will regret using Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"bye bye Evernote. you were my first note app almost a decade ago but sadly not the last one because of huge amount of bugs you have got from last year"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Mum"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Arricchita di funzioni ma divenuta completamente inutilizzabile. Non c'è una nota o un allegato che venga aperto senza laggare e senza bloccarsi. Estendendo irritante. Ed ho pure la versione a pagamento."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"There's note conflicts all the time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After installing on the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I can't even log in. I put in my email address but the Continue button does nothing. Uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"As others have noted Evernote used to be much more useful than it is now. I had the paid version, which I used to feel was worth the money. Ive tolerated many technical difficulties over the years with the understanding that nothing is perfect, & I didn't want to invest time & effort into finding a replacement program. The tech issues are getting worse, though, & as I need it to simplify, not complicated my life, Im done. It freezes, fails to render, retrieve & search files, & is unreliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just want one notepad app to be free and awesome, not one or the other."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is actually good but on the galaxy fold the app freezes when I try to make a sketch on the fold 5"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been a subscriber for a long time, but over the past 1-2 years have increasingly used Google Keep as Evernote was so slow to load on my Android phone. Keep, however, severely limits text when cutting and pasting and doesn't paste graphics. Finally, I deleted Evernote along with many other apps due to space limits. Now, with a new 256gb phone, I have reinstalled it. I read that Evernote is under new ownership, so maybe the issues I had are being resolved. Will update review if appropriate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I added a notebook in collaboration with my friend. We added text and images in the notes. After adding from my end the content keeps getting overwritten when my friend goes for the edit. I want to continue with app so kindly resolve the issue and help me retrieve my lost data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently updated to 10.56.3 (1210689) Unfortunately now it doesn't create and even not openes my old notes. UX is beautiful but unfriendly, yh we can change a bit how it look but even this is not helping. As well some other futures don't work:( Sorry, guys, previous ui was totally okay and easy to use. How can I backup????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disgusting. Their cheapest subscription is more expensive than the entire Microsoft office suite. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook & OneNote. All that, or Evernote. Weekly subscription fees? seriously? too afraid to show what it costs monthly? hoping people forget about their subscription and then can't access their data if they cancel? Your marketing/sales team seems like they are using a manufacturing cost basis approach to your pricing. You should figure that out before it's too late."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"UPDATE: EXTRA GARBAGE DONT USE. Such garbage. Is it cuz im not paying for it? That's lame don't make a free version if it doesn't work just to annoy people to pay. That's bad business, so that's an uninstall.. 2 stars cuz it let me write notes a few times before becoming annoying to use. So beware it will start to be."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for almost a year now, so I feel pretty confident that I know how it works and have explored it thoroughly. This app is a complete waste of time and money. 1) it crashes about 20% of the time 2) when it crashes, it DELETES the note that you were working on 3) even when it doesn't crash, it might choose to delete the last line you wrote in the last note you edited, WITH NO WARNING 4) they raised the price of this garbage to $130/year!? You can't take notes......on a note ap"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loved the app and finally gave in to it pushin me to the premium sale. I swear as soon as I paid the app went to absolute ****. It's slower than my grandmother and doesn't even save my notes half the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app daily for years. In the past couple of months, the app has gotten incredibly buggy and lags in loading and saving simple notes. Also routinely creates multiple duplicate versions. Going to have to switch to a new app. Being able to search and pull something up quickly is pretty critical for a notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing when I try to open a note. Used to be great. But now it won't open a note. I've sent in a report to support with no response. I've Uninstaller/ reinstalled. Rebooted my phone. Still it opens, I pick an action (open a note, create a new note, try to search..) it crashes and the app closes. I'm paying for this and now I'm going to need to store my notes elsewhere.. didn't work and useless. So I'm using ms notes now."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since the last version, text written from right to left is displayed distorted. Please fix it, it's disrupting all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"tl;dr: new interface bad, passkode broken. App had pretty much the same interface for 10+ years, and it was good. Now it's suddenly updated, looks like generic WordPress shop template and lags like hell (tho mostly on ""first"" launch). Also passkode keyboard is TWO ROWS now, with ""1 2 3 4"" and ""6 7 8 9"", rest of the buttons is offscreen (phone is in portrait orientation, and no, it's not scrollable).

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another example of an amazing app that was bought out, only to be turned into a money generator, with ZERO care for the users. Bending Spoons uses predatory practices to aggressively monopolize its users and will do anything they possibly can to strong-arm you into spending money on their products. Garbage company. Fake values. Absolute dumpster fire of a manifesto. Bending Spoons charges astronomical prices, in an attempt to force old users into buying due to the sunken cost fallacy. Crooks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The UI is great. Exciting to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps crashing at homepage of dashboard."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing. best app for notes. using for 5 years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst note app I've ever used. Buggy and full of syncing delays. About half of your notes are not saved properly and will just randomly disappear. Never install this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a dedicated user of evernote since I discovered it. I have over four hundred different notes and want to keep using it. However, the evernote plan seems to have changed. It won't let me create additional notes without paying for a subscription I simply cannot afford. And yet, on their site it still shows that the free version should allow 100,000 notes. If I have to move my notes elsewhere I'm going to be very displeased. I loved this app until now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Going full subscription. No longer free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I agree with terms and conditions"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be good a few years ago, but now they added intrusive pop-up ads which show up when I really don't want to be distracted, also the app is very slow (it takes seconds to open a note with just a few words in it), also it somehow stores things online even though I never asked it to, so it does not work well in the metro. On two occasions it duplicated an entire note for me. Sometimes it crashes. I replaced this app with Obsidian. On the upside, it has voice recording notes and videos."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Failed to save note, multiple rimes, lost work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's a good product, although over the last year (since the changes) I find it really slow at times, in fact so slow that it doesn't synch properly fast enough from Mobile to Desktop versions. I hope it improves."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has basically become unusable. Cannot delete or export more than 100 notes, cannot empty trash,keeps crashing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not work at all on my chromebook."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Well, it's downloading as we speak, literally without any exaggeration,this app help me collect my thoughts as well as others and so much more than just what I mention. I'm getting beyond tired of this since I forgot where I was going with that LMAO"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has now lost three notes I've created. I write poetry, and cannot replace these losses. I'm not using this app ever again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for 10 years across many different phones. Was always flawless. No longer. Newer versions are unbelievably buggy. Information is lost. Or takes multiple attempts to load. Sometimes information is duplicated. There's no rhyme or reason. The app has just fallen off a cliff. Unfortunate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app should work without internet also 🫤😡😡"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"could be faster."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm done, long time user, but it gets worse and worse, I'm not paying for your very very bad service, switching to another app, bye bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So amazing 🌹"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Someone cloned my account. My picture their email."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Convoluted and archaic. Free version gets constant pop ups to subscribe. Evernote used to be a great free tool. Now you have to pay to get a ""normal"" functioning app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I literally never review apps. This one is terrible. They keep updating it to be worse and worse and now it's literally unusable. Stay away Update: I just wanted to update this two years later to say this is literally the worst app I've ever used. It doesn't even load up pages half the time and has to be restarted. Time to finally take the time to move all my notes to literally anywhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Went grocery shopping today. Removed items from the evernote list as i went. That was 5 hours ago. I just added some new items and also made changes to my 'to do' list. Then evernote restored yesterday's versions of both notes while I was still typing. The quality of the basic functions has been eroded time and again during the time I've used this app.(2012). Harassing pop-ups offering great pricing that will never be offered again. I've seen it so many times i know its a lie. app now c**p"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I spent ages collecting data, hours on end, I saved it all correctly, only to find it all gone when I come back to it, and this happened more than once. And they want me to pay for something that doesn't work? I will be migrating to another platform after more than 5yrs using this one. Waste of time. I do not recommend!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Was the best. But it is not anymore. Glitches in where my notes have errors (some notes written have disappeared). And so I'm about to uninstall. Gave many chances."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm sad to say that I feel like I have to part ways and find a better app to suit my needs. Evernote used to be my favorite notes app, but now I can't jot down fast notes because of the near constant pop-ups for premium that I have to exit out of. There's also the numerous times where my notes have been completely deleted when I switch tabs back and forth on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very, very buggy. Using Galaxy S22 Ultra, so the device is no slouch. Screen write doesn't work and app freezes up. Over a year ago I switched to Notion and was just checking back to see if there was any change and there isn't any, just same bad programming issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gets in the way on startup with intrusive premium plan ad. Doesn't always save your notes, I lost an entire game of stats I was keeping because it didn't save it when I next opened the app. Offline saving only on premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app has been my go-to for about a decade but I think it might have to stop using it because lately it has been deleting notes that I have saved. I rely on this app for so many important things. I might have to start looking for a new app if this bug doesn't get fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"making notes available offline only through a paid feature is completely unnecessary"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Doesn't support hebrew properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless unless you use a paid option, and those options are insane pricing. They only offer weekly, or yearly and both are incredibly expensive for a note taking app. The free version is so restrictive with its features it's actually painful to try and do anything since half the buttons shown are paid options... stick with something free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the 2023-10-17 update, sharing things ( including pictures on my phone and web pages in Chrome) fails. There is a long pause after I try to share and then an error message that says Evernote keeps closing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login to my phone."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm still willing to rate 2 stars because I'm still running version 8.13.3. After this version they decided that form was more important than functionality. If you force me to upgrade I'll leave your ecosystem. Immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good for writing ✍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great until they started having a ""upgrade to premium"" pop up every single time I open the app. For a few months I was getting popups to upgrade that could not be closed and I had to cycle through several and then it would kick me out of the app. It's more reasonable now with just the one pop up. I've used Evernote for several years but in 2023 I about dropped it. I'd be fine to purchase it but I don't need an upgrade for more devices or anything so I wish I could opt out of the constant pop up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I signed up it was free. Now they want $150. NOT FROM ME!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for years and it just keeps getting better and better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Login errors.... The app logged me out and now will not allow me to login. Error signing in Then frozen on the logo Credentials work on the website."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I thought they fixed the forced auto rotate, but just kidding, it's still doing the auto rotate today. Ugh. The new updates make it a little laggy, and hitting the back button dumps me completely out of the app. I also had an error with a new note I was trying to write and had to completely redo everything but the title."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"my life os written on it. it saves your past, present and future. It became like a diary for me, every idea, every reminder, every pending stuff. The most important app of my life. Update 25/10/23 What is happening to evernote? Im losing notes, sometimes it simply does not save, the app e buggy top-bottom! It is one of my main work tools. WHAT IS HAPPENING?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since 2011. Yesterday, out of the blue, it logged me out and wiped all my notes. SERIOUSLY unhappy. BEWARE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not as good and fast as before I updated.... And it doesn't let me in after Log in... What is this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Enough said! Worthwhile? Since the last update, not working optimally"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What used to be a great app is now pretty much unusable. Before I can access my content, the screen is obliterated by an over-priced subscription pitch. It may be worth your while, if you're using it for business, and collaborating on work documents; just trying to figure out how to get to my grocery lists, and when to call in my prescriptions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor service. To make simple notes you have to buy the premium version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this was the best note app. Was. Now it has tons of useless features. Lists do not load from the first try (need to go back and open again). And since yesterday, it crashes and does not allow me to log in for no particular reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Buggy! boo!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just spent two hours writing out different things to talk about during an upcoming appointment for my mental health ADHD evaluation and it got deleted because Evernote's garbage cloud service decided to only save the title of the note. I'm DONE WITH THIS GARBAGE APP. I've been paying monthly for premium, too. Fix your trash and maybe i'll come back in 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Appreciate the interface on Android and how it mirrors desktop. But this app is exceptionally slow and buggy. Its slow in capturing clips, loading notes, syncing, opening PDFs, etc. It's buggy in that some things won't open (note, PDF) or the system back button closes the app. I have let their customer service know and they say they're working on it? Hopefully they get these basic things figured out or I may skip over to Notion bc at the prices Evernote charges, not worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Configuration in settings should be saved for each account like check grammar while typing. Some of my account need it, also some other is not use it and kinda disturbing when using non english language. Also pls make it available in settings to turn off the auto rotate. It always rotate when i put down my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update lagging like hell. Thank you for braking good app... I don't need pretty notes, I need them work fast."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love Evernote, and have been using it since 2017. I use it for my daily journal, and it does everything I want it to, ie. pictures on the pages, choosing the font and its color, correcting spelling and so much more. Thank you Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using it since 2018. Idgaf about price, give proper service. I've asked for the fixes multiple times in a row. The app opens too late, if I'm in a meeting it gets embarrassing. Adding to more pain it crashes everytime I opened it in my Samsung Tab S9 Ultra. I thought this was a bug and it would be fixed until I used my partner's Samsung Tab S8 it has the same problem and this is still going on for months even after updates. I'll quit Evernote if they don't fixthis in next update 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recording notes are broken for the 2nd time, full subscription shoved in your face EVERY time you open the app, only reason I'm still using it is because I've got like 50+ notes Oh yeah and sometimes when you click on a note, it just permanently loads and never opens, which you can fix my exiting the note and restarting the app but still just really annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"NICE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"cool app, very Useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2018. But it's since 1 year or a bit more that is full of bugs. Moreover you're aggressively doing marketing inside the app. It's not possible I write things and they disappear, the app that needs tons of time just to open. That's more a pity for me than for you but I have to leave from this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to you Evernote??? Why keep crashing after the new update!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sketch never works properly anymore. And it sometimes loads forever and doesn't save properly now. It had been very good for many years but not anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update it's the worst notebook ever and it was the best!!! The search is not providing all the results, just few, not possible to find anything...not working offline (and was working before), not convenient interface (and was the most convenient), started to be very slow (and was fast), etc. Very disappointed with the update! Planning to delete the app and start to use something else!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pile of rubbish"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"user interface lags"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Moving to entirely different notepad app. Previous Evernote version worked better than current updated version. 1. This version does not offer list view as an alternative to the thumbnails. 2. It's become cumbersome/slow to use app functions. 3. No longer works offline if using free app version 4. Now saves empty notes/ notes which don't include content after creating. In the previous convenient version, empty notes weren't saved but automatically discarded."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It crashes constantly. It shouldnt take me 4 or 5 tries just to view a single note. Ive had multiple days in a row where the app is unusable because their current upsell popup is glitched and won't close."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App used to be the very best 12 yrs ago. Now, becoming more n more super unstable ever since they overhauled the user interface. Even some functions dont work for almost a day before returning to normal. And they keep on ramming down our guts the premium plan which has become too prohibitively priced. PLS DO NOT GET THIS APP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"parts of text sometimes being copied into another part of note. sometimes some parts of text just being deleted completely. often update conflicts between phone and pc. as someone who uses this app for at least 10 years, all problems started when they completely changed their app and ui 3 or 4 (maybe 5) years ago. and i didnt even started to point other problems that bothered me for years after this huge update. i'm done"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great ... More I only use it because they have years of my life here hostage , help !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Favorite note taking software for AndroidOS! - #BT21™ 🗒️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a great product until I was convinced to upgrade. I am being billed every month, but my subscription was never upgraded. I have tried every suggestion in the support articles, submitted multiple support tickets, and still I can't use the subscription I am paying for. Really starting to think I need to look into another product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Zero safety"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've lost a lot of things I've posted, not sure if it's user error, and there were a lot of ads to upgrade to the monthly membership."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is utter trash now there are lot of alternative for this app. Whatever u click it's ask for upgrade now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst aap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for a few years. Use to love this app. Now it always gets stuck loading. Everytime you open a note its a 50/50 toss up whether it will actually open or you will need to restart the app. Irony is that they keep asking to upgrade to premium, but I won't even consider to pay for an app with so many problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes are no longer saving which not only renders this app useless, but has also led me to lose valuable information with no way to retrieve. It's unfortunate the app has gone downhill as of late. I've been using Evernote for over a decade, but now it looks like I'm going to need to move on from this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Slow and cumbersome on my phone. The browser clipper doesn't work - it appears to be busy clipping but never finishes. I can't wait for 5 min or however long it takes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extreemly unreliable lately in the conditions with intermitent internet connection. It is loosing exactly the notes which have relevance to me, but keeping shopping lists, etc. Lately asks too agressive for money, maybe that makes it unstable too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Personally not a fan of the UI or layout. All should be free in my opinion. Even though I really hate far-left stupid google & microsoft... google docs & microsoft word are more of what I'm looking for. Don't think you're a far-left woke liberal democrat company but I could be totally wrong. Keep improving this app though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Starting about 2 years ago there has been an increase in bugs in Evernote. Some of them have been pretty severe. I don't feel like they take Android as seriously as other platforms. I've been using this app over 10 years and reliability has gotten noticably worse in the last year. There has been a bug for a while now that causes images not to render. This has been very disruptive to me and support has not yet acknowledged the issue even though there are several reports in forums."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Having used Evernote as a paid user for over 10 years, finally decided the price increase wasnt worth paying for. Now it constantly harress me to signing up on special ""offers"". Just bad business and direction this company is going."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Really good app. Have gotten really slow and buggy in past few months"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Too much useful apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Often very slow to open notes, has completely erased a large amount of text from my notes on multiple occasions, the pricing is ridiculous for an app with so many issues"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"scumbag move, allow us to accumulate data for years and turn around and charge us to use this service. lots of free alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Everything is pay for play. I shouldn't have to spend ten minutes setting it up for it's designed use only to find out you have to pay for basic features. The tasks party of the app seems a little weak as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update on Evernote: It has now become Nevernote. I can only speculate on what kind of genius was required to drive a five star app into the ground. My advice: walk away. Five stars to two. After weeks of being harassed to upgrade and/or choose the paid version of the app I tried several times to do it. It won't load and now it's simply broke. Too bad, uninstalling."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why do you have a preset font size? Those of us who have poor eyesight should be able to choose and preset our own font size. I cannot stress on how extremely tiring and frustrating it is to keep having to change font size multiple times even within the same note, so much so that I am considering changing to a different note taking app. Can something be done about this please? Edit: I was going through some old notes from '21, and discovered that my photo attachments have disappeared."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I cannot dismiss the upgrade splash screen so I am not able to access any of my notes. The upgrade screen will dismiss then immediately reappear indefinitely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Later 2023: absolutely useless app. Randomly deletes saved notes. You go back to a note, and the content is missing. 2023: why, for the love of DOG, can't you just let me write a note?? It's your core business!! I don't want to wait for syncing, do that later!! I JUST WANT TO WRITE A NOTE!! Absolutely ANYTHING that forces me to wait before I can write my note is a MASSIVE FAIL on your behalf. I don't want your ads! I don't want a 5 second wait for another process, just let me MAKE A NOTE!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It never saves the important notes and its so frustrating. I no longer trust it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After upgrading to latest version, I started struggling with my notes. You have one month only to solve these problems or revert to old version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"With every update, this app becomes less and less usable (performance issues, features disappearing, bugs, performance issues, yes twice). Update 2022: still the same thing, but now trying to guilt trip their users in buying premium without possibility to opt out... Update 2023: the newer version were still unstable and sluggish so i was stuck using the ""legacy"" apps. Those are are now deprecated so i'll move on from Evernote, after 10 years. So long and thanks for all the fish (and crashes)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The absolute worst update! Evernote's CONSTANTLY duplicates my notes. I open the app and find 20 to 25 duplicates of a single note. And there is ZERO option to select-check and delete those annoying copies!! You have to open the note and painstakingly delete one at a time. 20 times!!! I just wanted to take a little note!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Major problems all of sudden. Getting caught in a login loop and cannot access notes anymore. Not sure what is going on right now but not happy!!!!! Been using this app for 10 plus years and never had this problem before. I need some help!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly begging for you to get premium. Only use it because I'm too lazy to find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since 2017 for note-taking. Recently, I faced a subscription payment issue. My ₹1500 payment didn't auto-renew, and a ""Pay Now"" link led to a page with no payment option. I raised a support ticket (#3767627) with a screenshot but got no resolution. Now, I'm unexpectedly asked to pay double. I value Evernote but hope they fix this issue promptly to maintain my trust and satisfaction."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bugs..Bugs and more bugs with every update. Yet to fix the note duplication issue with slow networks, no option to disable note sync to prevent it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The last updates made the app really fast, also the AI search is amazing if you plan on building a second brain based on your notes. Looking forward to how the next chapter for this app will look like. So far it has remained my go-to note-taking app and planner, simply because it's easy to work with and easy to implement, integrate with email, browser for web clipping."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paying user for more than 10 years, considering alternatives now. I'm currently testing some other one, on the point of importing all notes there. Of course, Evernote is giving me a hard time at doing that, but I'm slowly getting there. Sadly, I have to go through that since Evernote constantly crashes or stops syncing on all my mobile devices. The desktop app works a little better, but I still need my mobile options which Evernote is not able to offer anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gone tremendously downhill and they don't make it easy to leave."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"completely worthless. whichever genius created/signed off on this most recent update must've been desperate to sabotage this program bc it is now trash. almost everyone lost access to their accounts & all their notes, including myself & everyone else found their notes wiped completely. if you can login at all, you can't even save anything. this app is literally a dumpster fire burning right in front of our eyes & it needs to be fixed or shitcanned. & the idiot behind the update fired yesterday."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Works so good but if you don't have a subscription, there's very few things you can do. The subscription cost is outrageous. It's cheaper to do a Microsoft 365 subscription and use OneNote. Or if you have an Apple device, use Apple Notes. The price isn't worth it at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So slow, cumbersome and bloated. Used to be great. Devs areshat"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have adjusted my review. I have used Evernote for years and loved it. It isn't perfect, but until recently had been functional. The latest update to Android, has basically shut down the search function. Imagine you have a few thousand notes you rely on regularly, and no way to get to them. 10/20/23 Still using Evernote...more than 10 years now. To their credit, most of us don't post when everything's working fine. We're back to freezing on Android for any search function..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app keeps deleting the most recent note! This has made what was the best multi-platform notes app essentially worthless. I have twice lost important information that took considerable time to write. The app is excellent in every other respect. Without an immediate fix, I will sadly have to find another platform, and I am sure others will, too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"free for 2 devices and has saved my bacon a few times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using that app for a couple of years, but recently it just became horrible in performance. The last drop was that it just erased SAVED note. A no backup function or sth is available. I do not recommend it to anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It became slow and glitchy. Bring us back good old stable Evernote from 2015 please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Virtually a 40 percent increase. New users, Do you want your app to hit you with this kind of increase?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it's success over recent years has been capped by its 2 device rule.... otherwise it had the potential to be a much much greater app in the face of competition.... its a shame the vision was lost... shrinking and shrinking market share....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"14 year paying customer. You succeeded in turning away even your most ardent clients. Deteriorating product, unreasonable pricing... Bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I would have given good rating but recent update nar all my interest...I am unable to open any of my notes and for this I am bound and frustrated to give it such a rating.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Used this app in college. Still has my notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No longer works, and now is too expensive. It never connects. I have to back out and go back in all the time, and then I get a notification that Evernote has lost their ever loving minds and increased their subscription costs by over 60%. I have cancelled my subscription and uninstalled. It used to be great. Now, it's just a memory."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be my goto app for quick and easy note taking and management. New update destroyed a very simple workflow with now extra steps and confusing lay out.. anyone know a decent note taking app to replace??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good Muslim"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this app for more than 11 years. It had been awesome, but not anymore. Absolutely useless. Spins and goes nowhere. Notes are lost, or duplicated. It has gone backwards big time. Will be looking for another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had an Evernote subscription for years, but I've just been notified of a whopping 70% price increase from $9.99/mo ($120/year) to $16.99/mo ($204/year). So I'm leaving 1 star and will be cancelling my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app drives me crazy. Sometimes it's quick, but mostly it is slow and often deletes notes I've saved. (take screen shots to prevent losing notes) Plus every single time you launch the app they're asking for money to buy the upgraded version. This isn't a good experience and I've shifted away from this app almost entirely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely trash, completely unusable app. Widgets don't work, scanning doesn't work. What a dumpster fire"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm having trouble in entering my pin. I can't insert 5 from the pin button."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"User since 2011. Now the app is garbage. Uninstalling. Nice knowing you for 12 years. Moved to Simplenote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Note conflits are common and understandable. But can you show the differences (conflict parts) and let users easily choose which to use, instead of just making two separate notes, which is so difficult to deal with for longer notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Easily worst note-taking app in the competition. Constantly makes undesired note copies, VERY little options particularly in work with tables, extremely greedy offers with excessive prices which is hilarious because NOTHING justifies them, overall just a mess that relies on longtime devoted members like me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"new version absolutelly not working. App opens very slow and I cant open my saved notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Imagine trying to paywall your users at every click and tap? I get it, it takes subscriptions for apps to survive these days but not when these subscription ads become obtrusive and annoying. You can't have this installed on more than 2 devices without paying, you can't customise your homepage layout without paying. Users beware, just use this as a simple note taking app and use Notion for everything else. At least there's seamless syncing unlike Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tell your developer to rewrite code in sign in process beacuse signing in with Google is not supporting.it is navigating to apple sign process when selecting Google sign in Thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app charge my credit card and did not update!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best for students"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing on my Samsung Fold 4"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for more than a decade, but it is now time to bid them adieu! My mobile app recently got updated. Now their ""special discount"" screen won't go away and I can't use the app anymore. The desktop app also gets a pop up offering discounts on a subscription, but at the current Rand/Dollar exchange rate there is no way I am going to buy one. Thanks, Evernote! But I'm moving all my stuff to OneNote which forms part of my Microsoft subscription. Adios!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened in the last update but this terrible app keeps wiping my notes. This app is now literally worthless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Detailed and complicated, not for single home user"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome app for your notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 10 years of using this app I've uninstalled as it's become too buggy when trying to save notes that don't save, even though it says they have or the notes don't sync properly. Even though there is a free option, the only way I can even access my old notes which were on the free version, I had to subscribe onto a plan, sorry developers, I want to use the free version as the paid version per month is too expensive as I just need basic features and I don't use it enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I was very happy with Evernote, but then they broke it by trying to expand it. I just needed something to write down my thoughts and review them on the go. Now it's got too much going on to be worth using. Very sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the most lethargic loading... loading... app i have ever seen on Android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Everything is perfectly fine except that I wish I have the option to change the cover of the notebooks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Owners keep adding bloat like AI features while core functions are getting increasingly unreliable. App gives a pushy sales pitch when opened about half the time that requires 3 taps to get past. Right now the search function isn't even working for me. I've given up on this and am working on switching over to a different note-taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app and then they changed all the features to where you have to pay for everything. But, worst of all, every week I get a notification that someone from china/brazil/niarobi is attempting to login to my account. This app is so unsecure it isn't even funny. So I am deleting everything off of it and finding something different. Be careful bc this app will sell to a scammer or whatever in a different country."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use the app anymore. Can't get rid of the popup add for a 50% discount."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been unable to access my notes for 2 months. At least from my cell phone. I've already made copies of them and it's time to find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Year by year this app keeps getting worse with more intrusive ads offering a premium service for ridiculous prices using extortion techniques and psychological manipulation. It used to be fairly good for notetaking but the useless feature bloat and the actual unskippable ads make this app easily the worst one. They hide the X to cancel the subscription and if you find it, it will show a manipulative message of ""you won't ever get this offer again"" which is a lie. Clicking confirm does nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"wow experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"trash app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be fine, now super annoying. Wouldn't stop pushing the ""limited time offer"" in my face. Switched to Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's quite laggy in android. Not sure why."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Want free Evernote? Too bad, here's an endless looped ad that tells you to save money when you pay for Evernote. Real nice touch."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very money oriented app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is okay but why now i cant access it unless i subscribe with the limited time offer?im sure i dont want to grab the offer but why it keeps on showing up..it only happens in the app while if i check it on a computer i can access it just fine..please help because i mainly use the app.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like the app, few glitches such as notepad always selects to bottom of list even when you select something at top. sometimes your notes duplicate or you spend time writing out notes then all of a sudden they didn't sync and disappear"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very good note taking app out there"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"over priced subscription. Can't import easily markdown files. Trilium and Notion notes works even better. but This app far too expensive subscription for what you get. joplin does everything and more for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"6 dollars a WEEK!? there are better apps for an annual subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Everything was great up till last update this week, made a note with text and recording of 1.5h which until now it was no problem, i even have notes with 2h+ of recording which go up to 10mb in size. Today's note 1.5h has a 99mb recording that is saved locally but not in note and note gets sync'd without recording😱🙆🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😬 this is got to be a joke, fix it asap! ... Great note application, easy sharing, editing, with audio, doodle, title, text editing and great widgets."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ya got greedy. Canceled my subscription. Been using for about 10 years as my password manager. That was all I used the app for. It was great for that. Did the yearly $30'ish dollars plan and was satisfied. Few days received an email forcing me to update to $129.99. So nope... Ain't going to happen. They do make it hard to cancel your subscription, tiny text ""click here to cancel"" way at the bottom of the page with 4 ""are you sure"" type messages. Ick... I'm done. Greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So 🤩So🌟🌞NicE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is good but the policy isn't. I know that 2FA is good. It makes your account more secured. So, when they requested to set 2FA, I tried to. But they don't send me SMS verification code to my phone. So, I can't set 2FA. I think it's because of my Myanmar phone number. So, I'm stuck which leads me to unable to set 2FA and my account is going to get locked if I don't set 2FA soon. Hence, if you can't send SMS verification code to anyone in this world, you'd better not ask to set 2FA. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's no longer usable. Idk what they changed, or how they screwed it up so bad, all I need is a notepad, it deletes notes it says are saved regularly, it fails to copy paste to and from, it's impossible to copy markdown. I am paying for this, I will stop after backing up, but in the past few updates, they changed it from an ok, if way too expensive notepad application, to an app that should not be relied on for anything important."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I can't open the app since the last update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote for more than 10 years. I'm really disappointed with it after the last upgrade. Unable to view any notes. I'm unable to upgrade, too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"NOT FOR FAST-PACED NOTETAKING, ESPICIALLY IF OFFLINE! It was a mistake to use this notetaking app for work. When I need to take down notes URGENTLY, the app would force me to wait for TOO LONG before it finally loads a note for me to write on. Then, despite the fact that I saved your notes offline and the internet connectivity is just for syncing, sometimes it refuses to open when offline despite the fact that the notes are already saved in the device!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been my pb&j for the past 6 or more years but this update got me messed up 🤕🍳Since the update (after multiple attempts to change my current password) I can't sign in or access any of my important notes saved here. Some I use for work reminders. Gonna give a 1 star until this gets fixed. I genuinely hope this can be fixed guys...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app but it just keeps going downhill it seems. It keeps getting clunkier, buggier and more unreliable. I've taken to backing up my notes elsewhere as I just don't trust it anymore. Would have bought a subscription if I was convinced it was worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dear people, I have not been in Russia for a long time. Well let's do something. In the meantime, you have one race. Ваш клиент Евгений."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app for so many years now, but last night it suddenly didn't save my note even when I pressed save. This app is so unreliable. The reviews were true and it seems the developers of the app weren't listening to feedback since 2020. I’m going to use another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using this app for years..... locked out, can not log in, to retrieve notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No autosave in 2023!!! Too many bugs, especially the offline feature has a very limited search capabilities."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's useless now. Takes too long to open. Offering me to buy their subscription and I decline but it offers again and again. It really doesn't let me use it. I use to love it. It's sad. I have to find a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sync is broken - changes are often lost, ever since the new big update. Terrible, switching to another platform soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The old interface was user friendly. The new one is better on a desktop but not mobile device. Pls make it easy to search for words within the same note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update just ruined the whole experience of the application, seems like Evernote is just thinking of making money, user experience is so worst that It's unbearable now, None of the funtion is working properly in offline mode, even for the access of our own note we need internet connection, application is asking for subscription for providing access to the functions which before were available free, please make it as before otherwise It'll only ruin the user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I so wish I'd read the reviews before updating. I wish there were a way to have only the title to a note show, maybe as an option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not loading tasks properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"That's it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the latest update not even able to open the documents. Showing 'Not available to load the note. Please refrsh the page or try again later.' How can i store important docs reliably? When can i view those? Or Can I?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't even allow login on Android 14. You cannot rely on this app for any data retrieval consistently. Horrid. User since 2008. Evernote is on a steady slide downwards. The current mobile app regularly opens notes in ""view only"" mode. I have to force quit to get it in my edit mode. No way to file a bug report in the app. The app simply gets slower and less useful with every release. V10 is a huge step backwards. Evernote should fire their entire product team and start fresh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very bad sync, notes got deleted on multiple occasions after clicking on save whilst Internet connection is 100%."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good all-rounded app. But still lack of features. It's so necessary for me to have sub-folders (no, stacks is not what I mean). Also, the lack of personalization (IDK, for example custom icons for notebooks or stacks, default ones are ugly IMO) makes the UI still looks old-fashioned. Last but not least, how can it be possible that the most famous notes app out there does not have collapsible content? Large notes are a pain to read. Those features made me try alternative apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i don't like this app, it is very slow, take time yo loading, and sometimes, crash, and inside the app, the view is also not so good, it is difficult to find notes, however it has all features which not haves, but app is bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since the recent update, only tile previews of notes are visible. As it stands now all my notes are list. :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have I lost everything? Or can I only use a laptop? Can't sign into the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's been really pissing me off recently. I'm not so mad about the UI as everyone else is. there are a few things that suck but it's not unbearable. one thing that does suck, however, is the fact that I go to make a new quick note to jot down my ideas and find out later that none of it has saved. this has happened multiple times. I write down stuff, hit save, close the app like normal, and when I go to add later, it's blank. no history, nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Going from Evernote on a Galaxy A8 to a Galaxy S21 will take some getting used to. A lot of unnecessary, almost counterintuitive, changes made to the app which severely reduces my likelihood of using it for notation or idea generations. Some of these issues include the addition of a home screen and the inability to sort notes by notebook (and subsequently alphabetically IN the notebook) Used to swear by Evernote, but now I'd only recommend the desktop version as the mobile app is lacking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ads kill the app 3/5 deserved for free (if it didn't have ads) 4/5 with paid features (very slight planning benefits) The CONSTANT ads to get the parts version feels invasive. There should be a selection to turn this off. I'm not interested in the paid version, never will be. Too many free apps that offer the SAME advantage, with companies I trust more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I don't understand what's going on with the app. I got informed to upgrade to a new version but still couldn't access my my saved informations in the app. White and black display, Frozen error, and lot more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was a 5 star app. Then it got updated. Now it looks like a web page and is not responsive. In the notes list, it wastes a lot of space (it is not the PC screen), it lags a lot scrolling, pushing buttons, everything. Camera widget was my choice, to quickly capture documents and receipts; now it starts the whole app instead of just the widget and I cannot just make a receipt streak. Much time invested in it, many notes already, but I'm thinking about alternatives. Now it is painful to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The last four updates won't allow any notes to load. 😖"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was the best app, but recently, it has a synchronisation issue. Many notes were deleted for no clear reason. Kindly fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unbelievable that this app cannot sync properly, even though I am using it ONLY ON ONE ANDROID DEVICE. It is probably the worst software ever written, created to waste your time and loose your notes. Constantly nudging me to pay subscription, but it is not worth a single cent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now unable to use on multiple devices for free. Totally not worth paying £80/yr for a note taking app, so goodbye."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing. Don't know why, but it is creating multiple versions of the same note without the content. It made me really frustrated when one of my notes got deleted, and somehow (with magic), it reappeared. Developers really need to sort out otherwise moving on as I can't keep having this headache every day"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many issues in the current version and I hurts because it used to be such a immaculate app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest advertisement can't be clicked away, cancel brings you back to the advertisement, same does ""I'm certain I don't want to take this offer"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Geting worst since last update, I cant access my notes on app. It is only can accessed through website. Never been like this before"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it's a disgusting app which lags and automatically deletes your stuff , unnecessarily shows subscription ad and it has lots of issues while logging in , it doesn't allow you to login once u log out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"i never used all of the business centered features of this app, stuff like sharing notes and making graphs and such so i cant comment on that. In fact evernote was my straight up writing app since about 2018,. I really loved being able to sync across devices without using google drive. None of this matters because I rarely open this thing anymore. The only thing I use is the quick note widget on my homescreen. Ad bombardment. I've been seeing the same pleading flavor text about this being a ""one time offer"" for years now. A while ago they added a bizarre homepag feature which I don't recall anybody ever asking for (all anyone wants from a homepage is their recent notes, right?) and a good amount of the stuff their premium version offers lets you do incredibly basic things on the weird homepage. You're going to force thus ugly, weird thing in my face and then charge me to doll it up a little? Literally all I've ever wanted from evernote was to be able to indent paragraphs (again, used this app for writing). Really wish it didn't suck now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want offer!!! Please!!!! When I check in Evernote, it just appear useless ad offer!!! Now I cannot check my note because of this stupid offer!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App keeps popping with uncancellable ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why there are so many glitches in the app?? There are multiple recurring premium subscription ads popping up in the whole screen even after closing several times and is not letting me use the app. The developers should think and act responsibly with the reviews, comments and problems faced by the users. If there was a no star option in the rating I would have given no star rating to this worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just keeps on showing adds when I try to cut it it again shows them"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Mark G from customer service can't trace an invoice for the pro service I paid for and my account remains downgraded. Now using my bank to try and retrieve the money. I cancelled my subscription.... Been a paid member since 2018. Be careful of buying from them they won't give you the service and will keep your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app, but recently I have taken extensive notes at meetings, and on a later date go to my note only to find the title and an empty note, this has now happened twice and it is very frustrating. These notes were taken ony Samsung S23 Ultra....and they expect me to pay to upgrade? Really? Not like this! If you actually want to get me and the rest of us who ""loved"" this app to subscribe you would fix these issues and stop popping up your subscribe option a million times daily!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to access the app due to a promotional bug! The app isn't opening at all and keeps saying about some offer that just doesn't go away even after denying again and again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is very slow, I have 30mbp net speed and still it's glitchy, terrible experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps forcing to pay, all I took was like 5 second to scroll and the add came up again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much for too little"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not bad for the most part, but recently the pop up will keep popping up and not let you use the app because it pops up immediately after dismissing it. Force stop worked a couple times, but this last time it didn't work, so now I'm effectively locked out of the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'M NO LONGER PAYING BUT STILL NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS MY NOTES. APP POPS UP WITH RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE ""OFFER"" 10 TIMES AND YOU THINK IT'S STOPPED, TRY TO WRITE A NOTE AND IT POPS UP AGAIN! ESSENTIALLY USELESS, I NEED ACCESS TO MY NOTES AND I'M NOT PAYING. PAID FOR YEARS TO BE ABLE TO EMAIL NOTES TO MYSELF, USED NO OTHER FEARURES. I can't afford 60 dollars or more a year to email notes to myself. FIX THE ADS AND LET PEOPLE USE THEIR NOTES."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"it's a good app but they constantly ask you to upgrade to the paid version, which I find a bit annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"👍🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not as expected"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Passcode is no longer available in the app setting? Now with latest update i can see its back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it. Became increasingly more difficult to use unless you purchased premium. Bought a new phone and straight up won't let me login on the app. Contacted support replied they don't respond to their support email and was linked a forum post unless I wanted to purchase premium for additional support. Can still access on web so downloading everything and never using again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last few days... stopped working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"every 2nd day it tries to get me to sign up to premium...so annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to log into my Evernote account on my new phone. please help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant login with google. It sends me back to login screen. Cant sign up with email. Doesnt work. Useless on s22 ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently Evernote pop up deal won't close. ""Are you sure, you won't be able to get back this offer"" and I click ""I'm sure"". Offer closes then keeps coming back up again forcing me to sign up. Not sure if this is intentional or a glitch but please fix this thanks. I've been using this app for years and all my sensitive information that I can't access anymore will be gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to love it, but the ad to get me tool upgrade keeps popping up even after dismissing it. I can't get to my notes anymore unless I use a mobile browser set to desktop mode (which stinks). I'm uninstalling the app at least until the promotion ends and will be using free ds note instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesnt even start. After installation on S22 Ultra, I can't even log in to use the app. Signing with Google does not work and signing with email does nothing too. Continue button not working. Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great Scott"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Works just fine most of the time but since the last update an advertisement for 50% off of year no matter how many times you close it and click I'm sure it will continue to pop up and make the app unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Nearly every day since mid September, the app has been making 3-10 copies of my note in the background which I have to delete. Uninstalled. App is now garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After new update Not working on my phone LG G8X"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to login back and no support from any of them even after mailing. Will backup and would not use this any more।"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app but don't like the new modifications. One of the best features was the app being free, but it's not useful when the premium package pops up constantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible experience and support. I was a loyal user paying on the personal tier for multiple years. The app went downhill recently and when I left my previous company I forgot to change the primary email on the account. I now have no way of logging back in and haven't been able to cancel my subscription and prevent repeated annual charges. Their customer support has also been useless and is hard to reach in addition to having no phone support available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am somewhat shocked and appalled at what I'm just seeing them do now with their app. I've been using this on and off for a few years now, but all of a sudden I cannot close out their pop-up ad for their premium subscription discount no matter how many times I 'X' it out. So , what now I have to pay over $65 to read everything I have written for the past 5 years of my life? Who does that, users place trust in you that you won't just hold their intimate thoughts for ransom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need my Eva notes back, I have some documents in the notes, the Evernote just crash I want you people to help me to open my Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"UPDATE: This was a surprisingly fast fix - less than a couple of days. Notebook titles are still MIA, but overall stable. Dare we hope that Evernote is back to being amazing? After years of devoted use and being and being an evangelist for this app, I can no longer recommend it. Something as essential as going back to the notebook list from within a note makes it crash due to some rendering bug on a fast device such as the Fold 5. It's a pity. Same thing works on an iPad, for example."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally doesn't let me log in no matter what email I use. I press the continue button and nothing happens. Tried to search on forums but it said I need to sign in. Pretty hard to do that when it won't let you make an account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been enjoying the app, but right now there is a pop-up offering 50% off that I cannot dismiss (when I confirm I don't want the offer, it pops right back up anyway), so I am unable to access my data. Not cool, Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had the most horrible experience, I was so excited about it and tried to login/sign up for free with three different Google accounts and all that happened was I was redirected back to the main screen, don't waste your time downloading it. Its a shame I have to delete it without even using it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"VERY NICE APP COMFORTABLE ANY WORK"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My Evernote was updated and now to makesimple things I need to press more times. For example when I want to make simple bullet lists I need to choose and open menu and then choose bullet list from other choices (checklist, bullet list, numbered list). Before it was just one click. It isn't only that but other things too like devider,.. . Menu now is at the bottom instead of at the top. Constant offers of paid memberships - how many times more I have to click that I don't want???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Must have app. Convenient and easy to use... from grocery lists to business notes! Does way more than I can use. Syncs over all my devices. Oct, 2023 - using Evernote for over 20 years and it's still the best. Only issue I have on my Android is an occasional fail to sync or duplicate note. Maybe the Oct 5th update will fix. 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Issue with Android14? Won't log in....."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to work great. Not sure what happened but on a Pixel 6 Pro, notes I've just written are disappearing after reopening the app. Also all the ads for their premium version are shown almost on every open."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lost all my critical data and years of notes. DONT USE THIS IF YOU NEED REDUNDANCY. if you're new to the app, it's not bad. You don't have a lot to lose, yet years down the road, it's going to hurt."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was an ok app until the update recently,never use it now,plenty other apps that don't want to restrict what you do."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's very disappointing. I can't login at all!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very good app, thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"when I press the back button, the app exits and it's a bit annoying My bottom toolbar gone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Down again. Cannot login. This is getting annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This was my go to notes app for years. Unfortunately, it's very buggy with their recent ""upgrades"". Now, they have raised the subscription price by almost 50%. I'm looking for a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please add the security lock and exact time of the note but not edited time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the app used to work fine and now it got ruined by greed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is reasonable enough, but the constant intrusive nagging to upgrade from the free plan is painful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is working good in my old mobile but when I install in my new mobile, it is not able to login."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,">>>>>>>DON'T USE THIS APP IT'S RANSOMWARE <<<<<>> This app has taken my information hostage!!! I've been using the free app for years and now I can't get past the LIMITED TIME OFFER screen to get at my data. I've open and shut the app, even restarted the tablet. I see my data for a minute and then the nag screen comes up and tells me that for $90 I can get access on multiple devices. I swear to God if I ever get my data back I will never go near this piece of $##@#."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The white screen issue has been resolved. However, checklists are still very buggy. It seems every time I edit my shopping list, the note duplicates and items disappear. I wish Evernote could fix this. Checklists shouldn't be a hard thing to implement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Application not working. Once you have logged out, now trying to login with my Gamil, its not working. I have recently switched from Realme X2 pro to Moto Edge 40 and now app is not opening in any of the phone after data transfer."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not working on tablet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has erased several important notes! Not as good as it used yo be"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for YEARS. The free version works fine for me, so I've never needed to upgrade. Lately every time I open the app, I've had pop-ups asking me to upgrade. Once I say I'm not interested, it goes away and I can use my app. TODAY, however, no matter how many times I've tapped that I don't want the upgrade, it keeps popping back up. There's no way to use the app! So now my notes are being held hostage because I don't want to upgrade? Come on, Evernote - do better!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"money money money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Log out suddenly and not manage to sign in again. What happen?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Updated 10/10/23 Y'all, I am not sure what is going on with Evernote. I have used it for years, but in the last month or so I can make a note on my phone using the app, I save it. I edit it, save it again. And when I go back, the note is gone. Totally empty. It's pretty worthless app if it eats my reminder notes. Great organizational tool with awesome search feature"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Duplicates one note 10-15 times by itself, used to be awesome app, now I'm using it just because of habit and lazyness to copy notes to different program"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I give zero. I lost my data and now I can't sing in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Is evernote not good anymore? I downloaded the app, chose the option to log in via google account, then couldn't get past the next screen, which was just the evernote logo on a black screen. Eventually, this timed out and took me back to the login screen. No change after trying 3 times. Tried to log in via email, next screen asked for a password, forgot password link didn't work. No option to sign up as a new user, only above mentioned login options. Re-installed app twice, no change. Gave up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ever since the app update I've been unable to sign in on my phone. Unfortunate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"every passing day this app is getting worse ,I had notes on this app and m unable to retrieve as it fails to log in,so disappointing"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can not login to my account. Even choose sign in with google, I am directed to create new account. How come? Please fix this bug and solved this problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Couldn't get past the sign in screen. Don't even waste your time!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am unable to log in to the application. It is not responding and keep on coming back to login page and not allowing me to login."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use to love this app and recommend it too people. Lately they've started to advertise their premium options a bit too agressively, to the point that it stops you in the middle of using the app a few times making you lose track of what you are trying to note. Not only that, with the free account you can usually log in from 2 different devices, and unfortunately it's not letting me do that anymore, saying I have too many log ins while I only have it in one device. Please do something about it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I donwloaded the app and I cant login/signup"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good Application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stay far, far away from this app. They will hijack your data and help is not available unless you pay them. I don't mind paying for services, but having to do so just to export your data is bad, and not being able to find out if paying will even help is borderline criminal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I finally upgraded my phone, and Evernote still decides to not save notes, and erases changes that have been made to existing notes. When I start a new note, I have to re-start the app 2-3 times just to get a new blank note to load. It seems to be a problem with cloud syncing & reverting. I've lost SO much information at this point that I'm infuriated. And they have the gall to obnoxiously insist on a paid premium plan. I've been using this software for 10 years, but after 2-3 of this, I'm done."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't login with my Google account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No themed icon support"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"this was a rlly good app before update, and now after they updated everything the app is so slow and often to force close."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it 🤩"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 12 years of using Evernote and recommending it to everyone, I'm now considering an alternative. Each update makes the app worse, with synch issues, constantly being stopped by an upgrade splash screen when opening the app which warns the offer won't be available again when declined, notes with check box lists continuously duplicating due to some ""synch issue"" even though notes without check boxes never having this issue, the list goes on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even sign up. First impressions last."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even log in in this app dissappointing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quite frustrating but I cannot get the app to open using my Google account. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still won't work. Bummer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good but now I'munable to login via Google. Plz fix this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Management got greedy and double pricing and now for the last 6 months I get offer my previous price at a 'discount' how pathetic lol"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every login always request email very, but still can't login after verify it even after change the password still can't login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sad to see a good app turn to pcp. Was this app sold to florida man? Its a simple idea. Notes. On a phone. Cram it with garbage popups?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless. Doesn't work. The app opens but I'm not able to get beyond clicking sign in with Google. After hitting the sign in with Google tab. Elephant pops up for a few seconds and then it reverts to the previous page that your on when you open the app. This review makes you choose at least one star but I truly give it 0 stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just installed the app because I was looking for a happy medium between OneNote & Keep. It won't be NeverNote! Downloaded and tried to sign in with email, it wouldn't even register that I had entered my email address. Tried signing in with Google, at least it loads for 15 seconds but then just goes back to the sign-in screen. I'm very disturbed so see NO responses from the devs to the recent negative reviews from long-term users. It says enough to me to not even bother with troubleshooting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't know what's going on but app won't let me log in with Google on a fresh install. Just keeps cycling to login screen. Same on my tablet as my phone. Seems to be broken.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the problem with cloud based services. 10 years ago when I started using the app it was great. Now that I have all my data on their servers they've gone and made the app almost useless. Would not recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm unable to login using any method available. Cannot use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I always use evernote. When i opened the app earlier today, i was surprised i got logged out and i can't seem to log back in. I've tried signing in with google and the evernote account, but it doesn't get in. Is there a bug in the app or something?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EVER SINCE THE NEW UPDATE, I CANNOT LOGIN AT ALL"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. Login hi nehi hota ha. Time wasted 😡😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been painful experience. As of late, the app just won't let me login at all Just keeps kicking me back to login screen with no messages"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"decent app for storing some notes, i am using it for 10+ years but with every update the app gets worse .. those days startup takes MUCH longer then in the past if that behaviour continues i see myself forced to switch to a more lightweight app or going back to pen and paper, for now i canceled the subscription and looking for alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It wont even log in so... i havnt even seen the features... 🤷🏻‍♀️ its just totally unresponsive. Disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The last update has killed this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After several app crashes, notes being duplicated dozens of times, notes not saving, and incessant advertising of the premium version, I've had enough and have uninstalled this app and switched to the Google Keep app instead. This had been a great app and service several years ago (thus the 2 stars instead of just 1) but has gone downhill lately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"always freezing or breaking down...really annoying. Please fix it!!! I use this for work everyday. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot login or signup"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using it for a looong time then it got updated-- it's response in now really slow. Everything lagging. The design is just confusing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for a few years and really like it. But they recently made a new update and I really dont like the layout and how the notes are organized. Also everytime I open the app now I get a popup asking to buy the premium version. Then I say no and its asked me if I'm sure!?!! I jist want to write a note! I dont want to be harrased everytime I open the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am unable to login with mobile application, samsung galaxy A14 5G hand set previously I used it in the same hand set, now I flashed my hand set & reinstal it & trying to login, it is not logging what is the problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I hate it. Both the new desktop version and the app. The most basic features, what we are used to are missing. The app is slow, a lot of options are not intuitive and hidden in sub menus. I can not imagine who thought releaseing this was a good idea. You can't even edit hotkeys in the desktop version and I could go on. Update. We have AI search now. Who cares? The app is still slow, buggy, unreliable. Years have past. Still frustrating to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I too have used this app for years and now can't log in or get to my notes. Extremely frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was great. Now they want 100+ yearly subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have a subscription, use it on my desktop every day, but cannot use the app on my phone. When I need it the most. Cannot log in at all. That alone is worth zero stars, but I like my desktop version so you get 1 star for that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has slowly evolved (upgraded) into garbage. Use to work flawlessly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Login does not work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't add more than 2 photos without paying for the app. Can't use in more than 2 devices. Cluttered home screen you can't dismiss unless you pay. I would even consider paying but $5+ a month to take notes? Get real... I used to love this app but it's finally pushed me to try another notes app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been keeping notes in this app since 2012. A great deal of my information is stored there. I now cannot open the app on my phone at all. I have trouble-shot like no one's business. I still can only access my notes on my laptop which does not benefit me. You are only allowed 2 devices which is fine b/c I'm using the free version. There is no way to contact Evernote for support. Losing access to all my information is pretty terrifying. I cannot export my photos so I have lost access to them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"1. I would love it if it would have speech to text feature.(Even Microsoft word has this feature called as Dictate) 2. Although I can use Google lens to copy text from an image clicked through the camera but if this feature would be available in the app itself, it would be more better. 3. If I have clicked an image from my notes, there should be an option to highlight the texts in it. I see there is only annotation option available. Hope you will work on these!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I subscribed to the premium version of Evernote in the hopes of making it my go-to note organization app. Unfortunately, the user interface is unpleasant to use on my Google Pixel. Editing notes is a real pain; the experience of trying to type and edit text, which I feel is very basic, is just so laborious that it ruins the app. I've cancelled my premium subscription and now I'm back to just using the default notes app on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was working well before but new updat is not working even when we click back button its directly exit the app , very poor update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update is just unusable. Slow and laggy, cluttered UI."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally cannot get past the log-in screen. I selected my Gmail, inputted my email...it just loads and goes back to the log-in screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even log in. After the splash screen it goes back to the start :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After update I can't login to my account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New version is having login issue not able to log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not being able to login into my acc. When I open the app appears the options to login via email and google and when I click to open with my Google acc, it keeps loading forever then goes back to the starting page."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I record audio through the app, as it's designed to, and sometimes the recordings don't save, make me download it to listen to it, or don't play at all. It looks to me like if I record my whole lecture during class, the recording is too big. But yet my account settings show that I'm not over on my total gigs I'm allowed. This is one of my top reasons for having this app, as most other apps don't have the ability to record. Also, it's been really glitch lately! Very annoying for paying $15/month"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. But now to use it offline they want to charge $$ for it. Was dependable good app. Made some changes recently and now it lags and takes forever to open notes. There are some serious bugs that need fixing. Switched to a new app that doesn't require me to have an internet connection to access my own information in notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Truly Awesome App, great features to take out notes ,task etc"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"the new layout is slow and very limited capability."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Having notes instantly available on all my devices is much better than having to sync frequently. However, the latest version (fall 2023) of the Android app is s...l...o...w and offers no improvements. And the endless intrusive pitches to buy the paid version are really getting annoying. Thinking of looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me sign up/log in no matter what I do. Waste of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app sucks. Literally won't even let me log in. So much for multi platform, multi device functionality. Super bummed about it. Was really looking forward to Evernote being my note taking app. Gotta look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to login with Gmail ID"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps deleting what I wrote when I save. Not exactly helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"price increase of over 50%...loyal customer for many years but not after this..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app is really good. I think something that would push Evernote to the next level and would honestly be revelutionary amongst note taking apps is the ability to scan images, indentify and copy text and quickly copy them to the currently open note or notebook. I have literally no idea why note taking apps don't implement this industry wide. It would be so helpful for students and corporate individuals looking through documents. Please add it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update is disgusting. I can not able to sign in my account. What happened?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After Android update I just can't log in Evernote (paid subscription!!). What the use of an app that you can't log in? Who will return me my money? PS: even when it worked, it didn't synchronize an Google calendar anyway. And tasks were so buggy. It is just garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I rarely give low rating, but I cant even get past the Google sign up. I tried several times to sign up using Google but to no avail."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not responding"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have loved this app/platform for almost a decade, but recent bugs have ruined my work. I type a note. And then when I come back to it 20 minutes later, all that it remembers is the note's title. This is so frustrating. I am careful to hit the checkmark to save the note. Most recently, I even closed the note multiple times with it saving properly, only to open it minutes later to find it empty. I am hoping this is just a problem with syncing in a recent update and that it can be fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesnt work at all, cant login to use the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would not let me login despite clearing cache and other stuff :/"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened? This was a great app, got the job done now it's barely usable. Have to find something else. When I want to write a note I want to do it right away, not when the app stops loading/crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It is helping a lot to prepare my digital notes while my preparation"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is pretty nice. It has a LOT of features (especially if you pay). The problem is that there is literally one feature I want, to be able to access my own data locally without Internet access, but it's premium and premium is just waaaaaassy too expensive. $130 per year is kinda nuts. If it was $2/month forever or something, I'd be ok with that... but even with their 50% off promotion that ends in a year, I think it's just way too expensive. I guess I'm going back to Google Keep Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Google signin and signup not working. Never rely on this app for the notes coz u cannot access it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update is disgusting. I cannot even open all my notes, it keeps on buffering! No point in making notes when they can't be accessed when needed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always a fan of thia app, but the latest updation has ruined all the fun. Please revert."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They recently updated the app and most of my picture file are gone!! Most of my pic files are screen shot of recipes. Years of files gone! Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks for the App, very useful, and also for free cloud storage.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What is going on with you guys?? Come on...When are you guys going to patch the note saving bug??? Every I save my notes it deletes and I need to save it twice. Sometimes multiple times. It's ridiculous."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login only. Keeps throwing me back to login screen. Manual login, Google login both don't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I cannot login with the new update to the mobile app. Can only login via Evernote web."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app won't even let me log in anymore. It won't even let me attempt to enter my password."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't get past sign in screen. When I try, it has the green elephant on the white screen only. I've heard great things but this is a huge bummer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even create an account"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Would not install on pixel 7"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hard to use an app that won't let you sign in or sign up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Obsolete. I regret paying for this app. I don't have access to my information after I canceled the subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constantly takes an age to open pages either on 5g or WiFi."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can't live without it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent but keep it free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worthless App. This is my first app review ever. I've been using Evernote for 11 years and it's been great. I can sync between a PC and my phone. I updated a few months ago and now I can no longer see my notes. It just spins as if it's trying to load but never does. Very disappointed. I can't even use it any longer. Update after update I hope it's fixed but it never is. I may be moving on to a different company and app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App was previously great but not so much now and am considering new app options. App is now glitchy and doesn't save changes, despite it saying it saved and has synced, and then the changes will suddenly appear an hour later after having had to input them again in other apps. Constantly get offers to upgrade to premium whilst in the app, despite me rejecting this repeatedly, very tiresome. Disappointing to see the app go this way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash app I ever seen , fully load with bug , first if you want to log in it not easy and after you logged then app function are full with lag and bug and slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Just updated (Oct. 5, 2023) and now it flips my screen orientation even though it's locked. Please fix this new problem, App Developers! Thank you. Previous review: Help! How do I recover one I accidentally deleted?!? Love how it syncs between my phone & tablet. I just discovered the checklist feature where I can check the box when it's done - yay! 1/20/15 Update with Samsung S4 - still love the versatility & features, and they don't need ALL those permissions like so many other apps!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It takes ages to open a note, mostly I need to give up and try again. The note randomly doesn't save some of my last edits, which makes it completely unreliable. And the home view sucks, and when I change it to ""Note"" view, it goes back again and again. I'm using Evernote since 2015, and sad to leave for an other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why? This used to be a perfect app for note taking quick and easy to make a note and save it, not fancy bling. Now? It's totally not user friendly and I keep getting spammed to buy the apps way overpriced monthly price. I'm deleting this app for something else. Totally annoying now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great for the free version. Now constant annoying pushes to upgrade everything time I use the app (sometimes multiple times per session) with a BS sales tactic of ""you won't get this offer again"", yet I get offered it all the time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant upgrade popups . Every time I open the app I get an upgrade popup. This started when I installed the app on a new phone. I'm already a personal subscriber. Also your feedback inside the app doesn't work when you try to send via email. The send to adress is blank and I can't change from email to another method. Maybe a negative review will get your attention!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for around a decade now. It's become cumbersome to use. Notes aren't loading on the phone app despite multiple reinstalls, and there isn't much support to fix the issue. If it doesn't get fixed today, I'm looking for a new notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sign up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was great when I didn't have to pay over $15 for the extra features. Now I can't access my notes quickly. I use to be able to open the app and the list of notes was perfectly listed for my choosing. I can't even access my notes offline now. What's going on. I am so upset with whoever is responsible for this horrible update. I have been with y'all since 2012 maybe earlier when WEB OS was dropped out of existence for phones. Please fix this or I'm moving on from this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't login..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good for save important things"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app. Ability to file in folders and organise info very useful. Useful to be able to take Web Clips to keep useful articles. Can be slow loading at times, and occasionally loses recent entries, but reliable vast majority of the time. Great for a free app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A very disappointed free version user here. Like others, I've been using this app for years. Constant annoying upgrade reminders have now resulted in me now being forced to pay to access what until recently were free notes. I will upgrade, export notes and then find another app now. Edit; I've realised now that it was just the app playing up and I can now access notes again, but there's obviously a fault as it told me I was offline and I had to upgrade to access notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Worked well on my Huawei phone but when I switched to a new Xiaomi phone and tried to download the app, it refused to load."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Esse é um dos melhores apps que conheço. Uso tanto no celular quanto no computador. Mas, essa última atualização deixou a desejar. As notas não estão sincronizado direito, umas sim, outras não. Corrijam, por favor!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for nearly 10 years & been happy. However with the recent update the GUI has completely changed, now giving us a ""home page"" instead of just going straight to notes, plus the reminders and notes have been split, which is not user friendly, and the reminders are no longer divided up into the category I gave. Plus I can't sort the reminders at all, so all the latest ones are at the very bottom of the list, which means endless scrolling, and reminders don't work properly anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The android app is so buggy it's not even funny. With the price I'm paying for the premium plan, it's extremely disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for years and it's been great. They just did some updates in the last week or so and it's HORRIBLE. Really it's the worst, it keeps making new copies of my note and not saving what I had written. Getting a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Those wishing to move on from this previously-amazing, now-unusable app: don't assume OneNote is the best alternative. Try Joplin!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updating app it usually closes automatically after few seconds again and again open and the problem is same"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely broken I can't even sign up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app's mobile version isn't working. All my data is on it. What's wrong with this app? Please help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Notes are not opening without wifi. Very bad need to uninstall if this prevails."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience. From errors while editing and updating cards to cannot login, to ""too maany loggen in devices"". As soon as I can login again I will.copy paste all to googledocs and delete my account. Forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I can't select a single word or desired section from this Evernote app in my android 12 device. Currently I'm selecting the entire thing in the session. I'm using the updated version. The experience is the same for the past 6 months. I'm facing this issue only in this app. Kindly review this and resolve this bug asap. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. The only reason I'm using this is because I've already piled up years of notes here. If I could find a way to transfer my notes I would leave right away! There's so much lag and errors in this app. It's ridiculous that you still couldn't create a seamless app experience after all these years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open my prev notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Revising my opinion on this service. Stay away. They rob you blind for the pay service, and they restrict the ""free"" service to the point it is unusable. The latest pay increases are a joke. Just stay away."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want premium stop ads bombarded on me face goodbye until then"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Seit 2015 nutze ich Evernote. Mein ganzes private Leben und Studium manage ich mit Evernote. Dabei sticht vor allem die OCR Funktion hervor. Ich habe grosse Hoffnung in die neue AI Suche. Die App wird dauernd weiterentwickelt."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Big fan of Evernote since the beginning, I'm more and more disappointed. You try to add new features all the time but you are breaking the basics that make Evernote a great product. Everything is slow, there a some UI bugs, etc. So sad... New price increase with 0 more value : bit stop for me !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This new update has been a disaster. I have been using this app for about 5 year on a daily basis, specially because I like to take hand written notes. Now it's not even a notebook where you can change easily between pages. You have to save an add a new drawing every time and it crashes after 10 seconds of writing. It is very frustrating that after so many years taking notes here I have to find a new and more friendly app. I wish it would go back to the old format."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A Must-have App for every working individual."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been using this for 12 years and now its become the most unreliable app on my phone. Not only am i bombarded with an ad upgrade every 10 minutes, but it stopped saving every other note. Now even though i saved a note multiple times and hit the check mark, when i open another note, the previous note that i just finished is now blank and the 2 hours I just put in on that note is completely unrecoverable. Ive had 3 panicked moments just this week after my new note just completely disappeared"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have been using since 2009 and is one of a few services I have consistently paid for. It still does what I need it to do - mostly. But it hasn't evolved with the times and remains a basic Notes application with an occasionally frustrating interface - try editing a business card, for example. It remains part of my toolkit but it's increasingly precarious. Needs real investment to justify the price."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is an amazing note-taking app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not work with my S Pen on Galaxy Fold 5. The phone has been out for almost 2 months and hope you guys will fix it soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app used to be great. Lately, it has been going down hill. It first started with my typing not working properly, and unless I confirm a word it will disappear. Then the back button started exiting the app instead of navigating back. Today, despite my phone being locked in portrait mode, every time I turn it to the side it switches to landscape. I couldn't even send feedback as it just opens an empty email with no ""to"" address. & then they keep pressuring me to upgrade... for a worse app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The only app that works good on my e-ink BOOX tablet. Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If I could give no stars, I would. For Years I loved the free version then with no Warning you Started only ridiculously high paid version. Now I'm locked out of features I trusted to be there..most importantly my passwords. I don't have any way to view or print very important stuff I trusted to Evernote and the cost of your BRIBE to get my info back is much too high. It truly sucks!! What you did shouldn't even be legal"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last Update was disappointed🥲🥲"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit 10/02/2023: the glitches and problems even bein able to open a new note are AWFUL and only getting worse with the new updates. I used to live this app because it made my life as a writer easier but now I just hate it This is happening on 2 different android phones and a Chromebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It says the free version lets you sync up to two devices, but in addition to your PC and phone, it also counts Evernote Web as a device. When I installed the Android app, I had to choose a device to disconnect before I could log in. I chose Evernote Web, but it failed twice, then told me I can only disconnect two devices per month, and I'd need to upgrade to log in on my phone. No way to contact support. And it's more expensive than YouTube Premium?? No thanks lmao, I'll stick with Samsung Notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use it right now! Its performance and reliability are really terrible now! And all American developers had been fired!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be a perfectly fine note taking app. It did just what it needed to do. Over time it has been ""upgraded"" to give a pop-up every time upon opening it trying to sell a premium version. It also will refuse to open notes if the Internet connection is spotty, which makes no sense because they are saved locally. It knows they are there because the thumbnails show up but the note will not open. Has become a hassle to use so I found a better option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very hard to understand. Do not understand all the options. How to edit. Where notes & notebooks are. They bounce all over the place. THIS APP IS INTUITIVE. ONLY THE CODE WRITERS UNDERSTAND THIS APP. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO EDIT OR FIND THE NOTE I WANT TO USE. I NEED A MANUAL TO EXPLAIN HOW TO USE THIS APP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant pop-ups asking if I want to upgrade or how I'm liking the app when all I want to do is write a simple note. It also sometimes takes insanely long to load a few bytes of text. None of these problems used to exist when if first came out but the company became ridiculously greedy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Zero stars. I had been using this application for all my records. Medical, family, important facts, and everything that I needed to write down. Today, October 02 2023, when I tried to open to write down a project, it asked me for my email/password. I entered, and when the ""new and updated"" app opened ALL MY RECORDS WERE GONE!!! Don't trust this app anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Really bad app doesn't work offline"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was a decent app; fast and responsive. Now shockingly slow after late '23 update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What have you done? This app updated and is now unusable. Takes ages to load and doesn't sync properly. I've just spent an entire flight updating a note and saved it and as soon as I went online it reverted back to the original version, gutted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After update this time, this app really slow. Omg take long time even for open the note, and more confusing about the operational for this update. I think the old version before easier than this version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sketch inside the app is very Sloppy. I have reached the Support. They said to wait for the update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for a decade, but I think it is time to move on. The latest updates make the app unusable on Android. Scenario - I opened evernote this morning to check a specific note. I opened the wrong note, so pressed the back button. This used to return to the home page but since the last update, it just closes the app. Go back into the app and into a note, and now any note I go into refuses to load. Pressing the back button here crashes the app and resets settings (dark mode etc!)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for over a decade but recent updates on Android have been terrible. Copying a highlighted text doesn't work as nothing gets copied, highlighting a text and deleting it, deletes more than what was highlighted and with the latest update when trying to move a note from stack to another, expanding the stack doesn't work as the notebooks within don't get disolayed. What's the matter Evernote? It's not rocket science. I won't extend my subscription after this payment term."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using this app since more than 10 years but lately now it is getting frustrating to use it. Whenever I open the app and open any note, it doesn't display its contents. Rather I get the rotating circle on and on. I have to close the app and re-open it and the note works fine. This happens for each and every note. Every note is displayed in the second opening attempt. My device is LG V60."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app crashes all the time. Unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic after update. Crashing, not loading saved notes, back btn exits app, slow navigation, text editor mode opens slow and now after typing all lines in new note, the save btn vanishes and pressing back btn it takes to home and note never gets saved. Very irritating update. One good performance of the app is while displaying subscription ad that never vanishes. 🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Очень классное приложение!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"an amazing notebook and task app! been using this for 8 years now! thanks Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app since it was born, but I have to switch. 😞 The desktop version keeps crashing, and it has major bugs while I'm writing in the app. I don't know what's happened, but it's gone way down hill a couple years ago. I tried to hold on but it's time to go 😭 thanks for the memories little Ellie. Totally disappointed I have to use Microsoft now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It takes a long time to get into the app and open notes. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Of late app is having sync issues. It has become very slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the latest update, my app consistently freezes and is not usable. many attachments isn't opening as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for years now, but the latest updates (Sept/Oct 2023) turned the app to mush. Extreme lag, syncing issues, the browser page frequently won't work - losing bits chunks of my work when it can't save it so it DELETES IT. It now sees my Chromebook as if it were a phone and makes the functionality of it next to nothing. Click copy-paste, and it triple pastes after a solid 45 secs. Very frustrating. Now it wants to force me to update my phone, which is the only version that works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"its telling me I need to install an update that isnt available on my phone to continue using it, otherwise its an awesome app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have lost an important note because the same unreliability has crept in when then the app doesn't save work. Useless. I want my money back Unreliability is creeping in again. They take your money and then let you lose a lot of work because it did not save. Find another note taking app, one that is actually reliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After years of mission creep, price hikes, and lagging service, now this app has begun erasing notes without warning. I am a writer by trade and these are things I need. Bye, Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote since 2016. I loved it because it was minimalist and easy to use but they updated the UI in September and ruined it. I see they're now inexplicably trying to pretend their notes app is a planner app instead of a notes app. This is dumb. I already have a planner app that does what I want. Evernote was my notes app. Now I need a new notes app because Evernote doesn't work the way I've been using it for 7 years (and it costs more than Office 365 lol no thanks)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"impossible to use this app for free anymore. Cancelled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest update lost some of my documents. The app keeps changing my check boxes to tasks which doesn't work for all my different shopping lists I had stored. Been using this app since 2015 (keeps getting more and more restrictive). I just need general note pages, Evernote keeps trying to force the upgrade for options that were part of the free app, don't need all of the extra features, I will need to find another app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sketch, application keeps bugging"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using EN for almost ten years, but I'm moving to Joplin now that EN has decided to start implementing ""AI"" features. OpenAI and other LLMs trained on unethically obtained input are not something I want my applications to be using. On top of that, to export my data, I had to download the desktop app for the first time, have it repeatedly tell me I needed to unsync a device despite doing that, and then learn that since I'm no longer paying for Personal, I get no support. Good riddance."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last update is bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be good, but the most recent update makes it extremely laggy both on phone and on the pc app. I've been a faithful subscriber the past 3 years but am considering not renewing this year and using another note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Utter useless app. Now it has started charging for every single thing. Shifting to some other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very Good App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Not what it used to be. The features added over the years take away from its original simplicity for storing notes. As my note collection has grown, Evernote has slowed down to the point of being unusable. I frequently lose notes due to sync conflicts when using the app on both my PC and phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been with Evernote since 2012..... Not sure what's happening but in the last year there is so much lag on the app. I always wait till the next update in the hope that it will improve, but it has not. For the 1st time ever, I'm now exploring other note taking apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is so glitchy and unreliable, always ""randomly"" deleting my notes. I would never pay money for this, could you stop asking me literally every time I log on..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app often freezes or takes a long time to simply open a note. And the back button now exits out of the app. I had to find an old version to download, which works much better and faster."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for seven years now and, up until a few years ago, wouldn't use anything else. Lately they have been constantly changing the pricing structure and their layout/ features. It has gotten to the point where I am sick and tired of this nonsense and am switching to other apps. 9/30/23. Update. I'm still using it for one specific thing that would be hard to move to another app. However, lately, they are constantly trying to get me to upgrade. NEVER!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Multiple experiences recently of spending time writing important words in a note, pressing the tick/back button, and all those words being GONE without it saving. Lost all faith in this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has went from a highly useful tool....to just GARBAGE....all they do now is try to sell onto one of their plans...and if you dont subscribe, the will make their app experience EXTREMELY painful to you. Save local copies of whatever you do. They will try to withhold it from if you dont subscribe. Very disappointed in their current business practices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"My life depends on Evernote. Recently had gotten really slow unfortunately, both when creating a new note and opening an old note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good for simple tasks. Difficult to use some templates on mobile app- limited formatting options. Update Sept 2023: this doesn't work with sharing and has notified me to update to a newer app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The BEST in class!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Only issue that the screen rotates in the app when I have my phone locked in portrait mode otherwise it's a great place to store and organize my notes and story ideas!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ive been using evernote for over 10 years and have always loved the app. Recently they pushed out a change though and it takes forever to load each note. Im not sure if its because the notes are now online where previously they were offline. But were talking about loading a small note (like a grocery list) and my internet is workong 100% fine. Its definitely frustrating and as a result ive had to find a new app for note taking. If something aint broken, dont fiz it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app. Navigation is all kinds of broken. Loading times are atrocious. iOS version works well but this Android version is complete garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Is one of the best apps of this kind and I am using it happily a very long time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesnt sync across devices, randomly deletes chunks of notes, crashes, etc. Been using this for almost 15yrs but time to find a new provider."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After so many years become evernote user, I feel this apps getting more and more problematic now. Disappointing.........."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It has many bugs and too many paid features. The app keeps asking you to upgrade to the paid version, which is quite annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You said you won't give me that offer again but you still did when I rejected it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Insanely Expensive. If the price was monthly instead of weekly I would love to use it. But no, greed is the primary motivator for some."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Subscription ads are getting over the top, and 22 bucks a month for notes?! App is buggy lately too, consistently losing entries after saving. Going to Google."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst.Slow interface. Not user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really like this app but, the pushy suggestions to purchase a membership is annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I enjoy Evernote's because it's so user friendly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost my notes and performed poorly in my test because of this stupid app. After some updates images in notes won't render. Upon Google search I found that it is a persistent issue since 2021 but developers don't give a damn. As a student I would recommend you to rely on some other alternative else you may suffer too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pen input doesn't work properly for Sketch. I wanted to send feedback via ""Send feedback"" button, but it literally sends the word ""feedback"" via android sharing feature... Didn't expect that level of jokes from Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can no longer save notes via the web interface. That is where I use Evernote the most. This app has officially gone downhill. Hopefully I can copy them to another application. After 10+ years of using a great application, it is no longer usable. Nice going Evernote. Way to lose your customers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"From 5 stars to 1 over the past weeks. This used to be my go to app for any kinds of notes, lists, etc. It's unusable as of late,as it crashes the moment I start typing anything, or have the app open for longer than 5sec. Very unfortunate ... :((( will look for other apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need a apk release for android 9 ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Minha assinatura venceu, preciso muito do Evernote mas confesso ficar com os dois pé atrás; já tive todo tipo de problemas com esta plataforma, desde perda de documento por inteiro a lentidão no sistema, não conseguir colocar uma foto dentro de um documento, e etc. Espero que melhorem, ajudaria muito."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You change things...you make it worse...not waiting for network EVERYTIME I open app IS A PAIN...I WILL DELETE this app and find something easier....thanks but no thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"convinient"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Still needs some major issues checked & fixed. App on desktop & phone do not always match, & now will not sync or show my notes. Why are you asking for more money when you can not fix what you broke!?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"First time is free but after paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update becomes terrible slow. Create a new note took more than 1 minute."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Working efficiency is reducing, takes too long to type the notes, cannot follow my voice command for note making, highly disappointed!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad aap don't install this aap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Going downhill. I have to agree with most of the recent reviews here. I've used Evernote for a very long time and in the past few months it's becoming unstable. My issue is the app completely closing when you try to back out of a note. Then you are no longer able to reopen the app until you force it to stop and then reopen it. It also will get stuck on a loading circle quite frequently. Again the only fix is to force quit and then reopen. I'm holding out for a little longer hoping it improves"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Easy to take and keep notes on my android phone, android tablet, or windows 10 laptop and they're synced and available offline everywhere (yes, I use the paid plan to get that). Easy to categorize notes and view by category. Also like the windows web clipper for saving notes from web articles. But the app often requires me to reauthenticate just to edit my offline saved notes. That's a problem when Internet connectivity is poor or not available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the newest update is barely usable on the phone and an inspiration to switch to another note app... especially because of the premium forcing all the time. it was a fine app, idk why ruin it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How the mighty have fallen! I'd have happily used legacy version 6.x forever. Version 10.x, forced upon us, is sluggish, buggy bloatware. In particular, syncing of notes between devices doesn't seem to work unless you sync manually (and even then, it's buggy). I'll be switching to another notetaking product soon, and cancelling my subscription (of 10+ years)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using Evernote for some time now but recently my note updates are lost and not saved in the app and online. I even tried to update my note several times for me not to lose my train of thought but it wasn't saving and syncing. How frustrating! I'm transferring my notes to another app and I'm uninstalling Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"it's a bit glitchy lately and slow to accept the notes I place. but on the whole a decent app that I have used for years. if the glitches weren't there I would probably pay the premium fee. Update 25th August 2023: paid premium and I can't even open a note, sometimes I have to back and forth for 5 times (like today) over 2 hours to get a note up. Not helpful when you have an idea and want to write it down. 28th Sept 23: Got worse. Put in a note and go back to find out it's blank."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have always loved Evernote but since I updated my app I haven't been able to access my notes. It shows the notes, but when I attempt to open it, it just keeps on loading without ever opening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I click back button, this app closed. It is very annoying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please fix the application the app was perfect and organized but now with the new update the interface is very confusing you cannot see the list of all the notes just the recent notes I cannot find the rest also my phone becomes very hot once I open the app and the ads are very intrusive at first it was better please fix or I will be forced to delete the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2023 update: Raised the price of my Plus subscription from $34.99 to $129.99 (271.5%), some improvement, but still bad compared with legacy version. Red screen on Android, can't share. 2021 review: AWFUL Evernote v10... 2012 review: Excellent way to take and store notes and other (mainly text) data synced along all your devices regardless of OS for free."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"All is good Please update exact time to evey note and please add the security option such as pin or biometric"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can not open your app on my android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad to worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A lot of bugs ! Sometimes I lost notes without reasons ! Sometimes the app stay stuck at the launch screen I use Evernote since 2011 and have thousands of notes ! Since this app is not reliable any more, I will switch to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"mine no longer opens idk why. It just shows the elephant logo until infinity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"GET RID OF THE CONSTANT & OBTRUSIVE BEGGING ADS FOR PREMIUM UPGRADE PLEASE! 1 YEAR, SAME & MORE ISSUES! DISAPPOINTED & REPLACING APP! I have used the app for TWELVE YEARS. Sad. Not syncing correctly & I'll have MISSING NOTES or DUPLICATES CONSTANTLY. It'll uncontrollably scroll through notes. Can't turn off the SWIPE Back gesture & it's an issue. The buggy ""view only"" mode & this new clunky interface?! When does it stop?! I just want to take notes & create tasks. I'd even pay once but ea mo? NO!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Guys seriously, these damn Premium ads are sooo annoying.You lack the very basics of customer success and conversion... you are not providing a good product, sharing links are not always working and you don't really offer more than a simple notes-taking tool to justify the premium plan. We are surely biased from using the much better-working Apple Notes, so I get it's a tough competition, but please say it out loud, you either allow free users or not.If not, we'll find another option, not a prob"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Seems to get less usable with each new version. Also they doubled my subscription rate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love your app, but I just can't afford the premium version. Your prices are the cost of YouTube family like 2 years ago. Oddly enough, Evernote only has one plan– that I see anyway. Perhaps adding more plans could make it more affordable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit : i have auto-upda5e OFF on 5he play store. So why do you keep making my app un-usable while ""looking for updates""? 🤦‍♀️ And : still not using webclipper: wth did you do to the web clipper? In 2023 it is so broken, again :-( You should fire your UX people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"There's some nice features but the cost doesn't equate to the functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please fix. I keep getting a ""widget query service"" notification, and it won't let me open the app from the widget or the app icon. I delete the widget and it still doesn't go away or let me open it. I need these notes for work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote, in it's supreme wisdom, have decided to start charging me three times the price, for exactly the same features. Why would I pay more for an outdated app that has done nothing to innovate, or even simply add features that people have been asking for for years? Yeah, the answer is I wouldn't. Now Evernote will get zero from me, and I'll be switching out of the ecosystem and to OneNote instead. Your loss Evernote, not mine."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I'm truly satisfied with all the features it offers, the app in Android is so heavy actually and it takes a long time to start every time, and that's annoying, other apps like notion or notesnook can start immediately while offering the same features. And another important thing lacking is that there's no end-to-end encryption for my personal notes, at least having an option to enable end-to-end for a specific notebook would have been great. 🏆"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This was my favorite notes app for over 10 years. I have paid for it for several years. Now the price is increasing and support has all but vanished. Unfortunately I don't feel there is long term viability, so I have learned to use another app. Sad to be changing my previous 5 star review but it is no longer a 5 star experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have used this app for mamy years, but it's really gone downhill. Constant crashing and lag opening notes. Ads being blasted all the time. Just done. Moving on to something that isn't just a total money grab now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is a most users unfriendly App. Most of the time you are unable to find the right option. It's users interface is very bed and needs a complete change. It's old golden era will never come when it was a user's friendly and most popular app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update takes lot of time to open each note ,lot of flowery unwanted things added This was the best app But now when needed without opening or too much delay to open it's a useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using evernote for many years, recently the app has become awful. Too slow to open notes, pressing back button exits the app. To open one note i have to open the app atleast 3 times! Please fix it, loading time is infinite!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They no longer listen to your feedback and provide poor support. It was once the best note taking app and has since lost its way. Poor support and not listening or caring about customers. You know where that leads. I was a paid user for so many years, the new team that has taken over is killing the app. Stopped subscribing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for nearly 5 years. It was a great help until this month's update. The update is a disappointment. The APP has become way too slow. I'm thinking of going back to my previous Note App. I hope you can fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Super slow and I can't even open certain notes if they're too long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the app has gotten significantly worse as of recently. there's a delay in opening notes and sometimes they are failing to save which ends up in time and memories being wasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"3rd grade application software."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Accidently deleted a table and then also accidently hit the save button which is located directly beside the ""undo"" button in the app while trying to revert the change. The table is gone with no option to restore the note to an earlier version. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All my notes are gone! Is the free version just a forum for a sales pitch now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not saved Files 😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really easy to use versatile app. I like the to do list widget. Had to reduce my stars because I've had this app do a loading circle and just lose several long notes that are impossible to recreate. Seems like they should do a local cache that holds that information in case their servers decide to not work. Very disappointed that this has happened more than once."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"BUGGY, TIMEWASTING FRUSTRATION! was getting incredibly buggy on the Android app with notes just not loading and having to shut the app right down and open again.. And now in 2023 another horrible bug won't let me select and copy text from a note I put a lot of time into writing, in order to give the information elsewhere - very annoying app specially as a paid subscriber and you feel trapped on it having invested time and content let alone money!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"i used to like evernote but they started making chages to it about 2 years ago and now the Notes slidout doesnt always work. also it doesnt display all my notes anymore, i can only scroll to tje letter M. it wont go any further. essentially, i have lost half my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible app, comes with many issues. If you link two devices now you need to pay. If you try to unlink it doesnt work and it locks you out with all your notes lost. Do not reccomend"

All of a sudden, yesterday, it wouldn't load properly. If I was able to put in my email address, the keyboard would often disappear and I would have to close the app and start again. When I was able to finally put in my password I got an error message. I'm very upset and I'm supposed to renew in early September... what's going on??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App Version 10.47 is almost useless to me and nothing had been done for a long while despite feedbacks. I have to rely on version 8.13.3 on an older device. Please please please go back to version 8.13.3 and base your new versions on that as a foundation if none of you over there do not know what's wrong with version 10.47. This is probably one of the last time I am asking your team to do something. Update on 26Sep2023 after another 9 mths of frustration: Version 10.54.1 still same uselessness"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a good app but now they have this ad locking me out of my notes saying i should upgrade, had to force stop it see my notes to get them and now I will find another one whom I might pay just to spite the evernote freaks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"There's a significant bug if a user types a note on mobile but does not back out of that note to return to the main menu. The text typed into the note is not saved, causing the loss of text typed during that first attempt."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"used to be better, much better. after the latest updates it is much worse, very slow, can't keep the notes in your phone offline. I am basically unable to use it anymore. I installed the Google equivalent and uninstalling Evernote."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"you can't use the web version on a mobile phone, but you have to upgrade to premium in order to use a mobile app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eta: uh, I'm not paying $13/mo for this app that hardly works 😂 This is the worst app I've ever used. I can't stop using it because a decade worth of my life is trapped inside of it. I've paid them hundreds of dollars and I can't even access my files properly because their app doesn't work. And they don't seem to care. You can also only use sms 2fa if you pay. I've never heard of such a thing. Why is it so bad when it costs so much? I legitimately cannot wrap my mind around it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have had the basic version for years. Never planned to upgrade to pro but today was charged $137.05 for a year subscription?!?! Don't know how this happened, didn't want this, and really hope I can get refunded. 1 star until then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am extremely frustrated with this app. I was using it reliably to save a lot of important notes, but lately things have been randomly deleted. There are things I have saved to Evernote that are completely gone and not recoverable. I'm even paying for the ability to use Evernote across different devices. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now it is slow and keeps forgetting the state. Buggy af. Seems to be getting worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated review (from 5 stars to 1 star): I am not so happy with Evernote as I was in 2014! I am an Android user and a premium member -- the app is glitchy, won't open all the time, AND I am unable to print a note directly from the app! What's up with that??? Review from 2014: I can keep all my notes organized and easily accessible with Evernote. Love that I can attach photos, web pages and .pdf docs to any of my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If it were the same Evernote it was a year or more back, it would get four stars minimum. In its current state, deleting or downright not saving updates to notes and a paywall to access basic utilities, I refuse to tolerate it any longer. The final straw was when I was forced out of my applications on both my desktop and mobile unless I used a free trial and/or bought a subscription. If the aforementioned problems are a way to force people to pay for something basic, I will not feed it no more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It went ahead of itself. Always offering premium services, deleting content from notes or making lots of copies of them out of nowhere. It used to be a great app but not anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreliable and glitchy. Paid version and frequent user. Notes are often unavailable to edit, even though paid version is supposed to make them available offline. Glitches in typing and formatting. Not sure why there is a delay in going from note to note. I really wanted to like this app, and I still have the remainder of the year I paid for. Maybe they'll improve by then? A year later, I'm making notes that disappear. I'm going to go elsewhere. This really sucks.. why can't it just work?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"should have more perks in free version"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"what used to be a snappy, lean app app with predictable offline sync became a slow bloated mess since the total rewrite some time ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"stop easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been Using Evernote for 3+ years. I'm very upset to change my rating from 5 stars. I love that it connects over devices and saves automatically, but my notes are suddenly having chunks deleted from them. I had to reinstall because it deleted most of one of my notes and then made a dozen copies of it. I'm worried it's going to happen again to one I can't recreate from memory. I can't be using an unreliable note-taking app, I hope it gets fixed shortly so I can change my rating back."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome note taking app. But need to improve speed of saving or opening notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Why Play store charging lesser as compared to website pricing of EVERNOTE? Is there difference of features?"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"C'est cher"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote since 2012. The recent update has made the app unusable. It's been frustrating that the main reason they update is to remove features to free users, but now it has literally become unusable. You'll have to open and close the app multiple times to retrieve text notes and can no longer search through your notes. It's lost all convenience and is now a nightmare to even use to access the text notes you already have."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App troppo lenta, le note prima di aprirsi impiegano una vita Poco intuitiva per il setting dell' autenticazione a due fattori Passo a Google keep"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good 👍😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very stupid app that kept making duplicated copies of same file, with updated data spread out in different version copied files! What a nuisance to keep checking which data was updated in which version of duplicated file! Not recommended to use this app. Been years, and same problem still persist. They should resolve this duplicated files problem first, as a fundamental issue, before they add more features that not everyone uses."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cant view any of the saved pictures"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is good and works for exactlu what you need but is very annoying and pushy with upgrading to premium. Despite me saying MULTIPLE times over the past few years that I do NOT want to pay and upgrade to a premium membership, it would still push notifications through to my screen daily about doing so. I've had enough now and defaulting to Samsung notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashes and crashes and crashes to the point that my tablet recommended that I put Evernote app to sleep. Samsung S7 FE. I have 10k notes inside and they just charged me $100 for a year's subscription so don't just tell me to leave and find another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"First of all I love how simple and useful this app is, however lately it has serious stability issues on Android that never occurred before"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally breaks all the time now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is good but I use it for free and they ask you EVERY GODDAMN DAY TO UPGRADE AND THEY MAKE THE CLOSE BUTTON TINY"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is an excellent app for productivity. It is a critically important part of my digital flow and it feels very fully featured. There will always be small things with any app that will make it less than perfect for some use cases but overall, Evernote is a wonderfully developed application in this space. Highly recommended if you don't use it already."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has stopped working as of today's update. I thought it was fixed, but it keeps freezing up. About to give up on it. 20230922 RC"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Best app so far for notes organizing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"You have ruined this app with your latest update. You've gutted the simplicity of it and made it a nuisance to engage with. It's a notepad, stop trying to be something that's not needed. If i you want to make a note of something you want to do it quickly while the mood strikes. Revert to simple. It was perfect."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"пропала возможность выделять несколько заметок"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's annoying how when I finished writing a note and press back it's always bring me back straight to home page instead of note lists"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks evermore.... this apparently just works!!!!! Over a decade and still going strong!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New update not really a good one, functions are bundled in one single icons, lags, searching is totally annoying (previously searching is very cool and easy now not) , If cut and copied any text it doesn't fix into shape of the app (say for example setting up default/customised word limit in each line) - if it is in newer versions it will cooler than other notes app under earth But the app's interface is really really cool and better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"old one was good. new update its worst. all data files it's gone in old versions. old accounts not opening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update is horrible. I can't open 95% notes (say reflesh, but doesn't matter, not open at all), the new interface make harder displaying notes. Now you need more clicks than before to get notes. In addition, now I can feel in my phone the app is way more low: every process takes more seconds, frustrating. Please, solve that new update because I'm not programmer but I can assure that it was completely a fail. Evernote is rather worst than one year ago. Fix it and I will change my rating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"is not opening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used this app before but it doesn't work anymore so happy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't use these apps I have lost all my important data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Buggy. Not worth paying premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app since 2011. I have been paying for this app for 10 years. Used to be an amazing app. I am now looking for a replacement. I'm soooo tired of the content of my notes disappearing (just lost all my notes from a 3 hour meeting, again). Crashes, lag, excessive battery use, unstable at best these days. I'm so disappointed 😞."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"(update)... Well you guys are getting worse and worse! Now it won't sync unless I actually Go into settings and hit sync! You guys keep making changes so that either when you open a note it opens at the top of the note and then more recently it was opening at the bottom of the note and now it's back to the top of the note. For those of us who create long notes this is a pain in the butt! Opening the note at the bottom of the note makes sense because that's where the next edit will be!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to this app?!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"There is no option to disable landscape mode while tilting the phone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"... honestly, I do not understand how it is possible to destroy such an excellent app !!! - This app has always been my favorite when it comes to saving sketches, notes and references. It has had good, simple and uncomplicated functionality. By greedy change of consumer policies and ""fancy' but clearly more complicated interference, this app is completely destroyed !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Takes to long to load anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is slow, opening, using, capturing. it doesn't stir on your phone so no/slow Internet, forget about it. Was much better before they kept adding useless features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can I request a refund? Purchasing of your product is accidentally only. I'm very very sorry. Please give me back my money.😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is the app constantly crashing today? It is very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too expensive"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant pop ups offering to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Using the app since 2018 or 19. Over all good app. From last update new feature introduced which is side by side view. All Notes in the note book on left side and selected note on right side. This view is not good to me. In previous version. All notes were shown in a list. When one is clicked it opened on full screen. If possible please add view button to toggle between the two. Images SAVED IN OLDER version not opening with message, image could't rendered properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The apps keep crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very glitch and often freezes also a bit too complicated and glitch for me to be able to make quick efficient notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Honestly, I had the worst experience in terms of UI and accessibility, especially with sharing a note for editing with others. Spent 30 minutes, you can only share a note to edit specifically by inputting a name or email (name didn't work even though the other person had access to view the note). Sending an email invite, the user is forced to access the note on a computer where Evernote proceeds to freeze. On the phone, it did, however, say the user could add access finally, only for view access"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need to pay now. Like forcing the user to pay because can't open saved notes in case of important things to remember"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Installed itself on my phone pretty damn scary especially since I don't download apps I don't need"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest update made me irritated & it is not user friendly.. kindly requesting the developer to make this app available at previous version itself, which is most user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app for notes. Syncing between platforms works great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has been reliable for so long but now, I've completely lost 2 separate notes in the last 3 days and it's very disappointing. I'm concerned about opening previous notes for fear they will go blank. Please, fix this issue and go back to the reliable app you were!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One of the best note apps became one of the worst with this new update. Hope you'll fix it ASAP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Clearly not under active development. - slow - buggy, duplicate entries in tag selection UI - frequent freezes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: Just got a notification that my subscription which I already paid $69.99 is going up to $119.99. A $50 price increase, really?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"With Samsung Fold 2 & 4 - totally unsable, app keeps on crashing - please sort this. With IOS and other android phones, app is working fine."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for quite a while now and I've found that the app has become increasingly difficult to use. Issues with saving, notes reverting back to previous versions and constantly crashing. These issues really need to be resolve as it is making the whole experience very unpleasant. Update as at 20.09.23: Unfortunately, things have become increasingly worse. I have had noted completed deleted. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Free one is clunky. Very limited sharing compared to other note apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be fine. But since quite a long time, almost always i use it and write a new note, i get some duplication of this new note, most of the time is an intermediate saving, incomplete. It's annoying. I then need to manually delete the wrong one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is it forcing to buy premium. Can't even open my notes without irritating popup. Utterly pathetic app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I was getting an error while trying to search for notes in the app, I logged out and tried to log in again but it got stuck at the login session. Error message says ""error signing in"" I know I don't have a problem with my password because I could log in via web. What's going on pls???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need it for work, using the free version. Slow as beans, sync errors, sharing has 90% success rate where 100% is the minimum standard. Wouldn't recommend."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Many features I used regularly have disappeared with the new update. Most notable so far is the slider that alters text size on my screen (not font size), and 'simply formatting'. The app is also much slower now. Now strongly considering a move to a different app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad changes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was fairly useful for several years but the latest update changed everything I liked about it and now it's more hassle than help. The new cosmetic features are okay but definitely not worth $10.83 a month. The price feels absurdly ridiculous for what they're offering. Changing to a different note app, someone recommended Obsidian so I'll give that a try."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ãfter typing a note it won't save and buggy not user friendly it just lost a note very frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"lately the free version has a lot of bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is an awful app. You can't even look at a note alone. You have to see everything else. The only reason I got it was to be able to see full screen notes. You can't do it. Terrible app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's the problem man...app doesn't load at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app keeps crashing every single time on Fold 4 devices. I wanna money back. It's a terrible experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Software not free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years, and it's been amazing. Regrettably the most recent update renders it practically unusable. Persistent nagware to update to premium (which I was actually considering, but not anymore!) The app is now really slow. The simple GUI layout has changed, which makes it harder to see which note I updated last. Also, and infuriating is that web links I have pasted into notes now require me to login every time I select one and step outside of the app! Terrible, terrible!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Does not load on phone or tablet"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Creating new note is slow which makes the app difficult to use. On first sync, the content of new notes is frequently lost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Z niewiadomej przyczyny skasowały mi się notatki. Nie polecam"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Awful. It's a pain to use. Sometimes data isn't saved so your time is lost. Their help is non-existent. If it weren't for the difficulty Evernote built-in I would've dropped this years ago. DON'T INSTALL! ⚠️ Yes it's free but the annoyance it causes isn't worth it Once I've found a quick way to extract my data, Evernote will be deleted ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't fix it if it ain't broken!! App is super slow and buggy since the last update. By the time my list finally opens, I've already forgotten what I was going to write half the time. I migrated to Evernote from Inkpad a while back after Inkpad became unusable after a stupid update, and it looks like now I'll have to move on from Evernote too 🤦‍♀️ Don't mess with success!! Ugh"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"don't like update. notes didn't transfer over that I saved here because I thought they would be safe. we should've been warned and given an option to do it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Edit: Problem seems to have resolved itself without update. Have updated my review back to 5 stars. Original Review: App keeps force closing even after uninstalling /reinstalling multiple times."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note app.so many ways to capture notes and readily available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the update I can no longer make new text notes."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Who the hell wants to pay $4 per week for just to keep notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been a devoted Evernote user ever since I started using a smartphone. Nearly everything I need to remember is on Evernote. That's why I gave it 5 stars. But I'm going to delete a star or two if you put an artificial intelligence between my key word query and the note I need to retrieve. I am not going to appreciate a low IQ, poorly written answer to my presumed query. What I will continue to want is what I get now, my note, that I wrote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used evernote for a long time and have enjoyed it. For the second time in as many weeks, a full page of notes after hitting the check box to save has disappeared. Like the only thing left is the title.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"In 2012: 5*, Over the last few months functionally has grown to include everything i wanted/ need. Full marks for effort and software! In 2023: 1* limited to 2 devices, free version has poor interface, frequent corruption of notes, doesn't support firefox, and the last straw a note i just spent 40mins capturing is lost and still the other issues mean i can't recover or even check. Not to mention all the good points made by other recent reviews. Notes should be frictionless. Goodbye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm tired of the ads asking me to upgrade and it keeps deleting my notes. I'm going to start using Samsung notes or Google. This app continues to get worse. I've been using it for years but I'm tired of the bugs and crashing."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best application ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What was once a good app now bombards you with requests to join their ludicrously priced SaaS pricing. To the point that you are now gated on how many devices you can ""unsync"" ie. get a new phone and unauthorize the old one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app ❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst note app ever : 1. Slow (even on S23..), either because of the app itself or the ad spamming 2. Bugged (switch to landscape mode even though it's disabled / Deleting some text deletes a whole paragraph even though you selected only one sentence / etc.) 3. Constant ad spamming (at least once a day, the app asks you to go premium and there's no way to disable it, adding to the slowness of the app) 4. Limited to 2 devices and 3 desync (then you have to pay) I'm so glad I switched to OneNote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love Evernote and recommend it to everyone, but the company lost focus years ago, not fixing countless bugs in its core product (the Evernote apps) and spending tons of money on questionable features, services and products (e.g., the now defunct Evernote Market). The company doesn't seem to listen to its users, its apps are getting buggier and slower, and the subscription price keeps increasing without adding benefits. It's really sad to see it go down like this..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I took multiple notes on my cellphone. Now Evernote won't let me access these notes, on the device they were created on, when I'm offline. I have to subscribe to premium in order to access it. This is completely unacceptable behavior. I originally started to use this app because of the convenience, but it has now became infinitely more inconvenient for me to continue using it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has never been installed on my device previously after my nephews played with my phone they somehow installed it and now I cannot remove it. App is basically a virus."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Forced upgrade to a broken UX. Unusable and Unacceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for quite a while, but a few days ago it started bugging by duplicating notes and deleting the content within."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not worthwhile... I had stuff on Evernote from 2017 and it all disappeared when I did an update. its 2023 and I still have a few bits on Evernote I'm going to move the stuff and uninstall. paying even £1 month isn't worthwhile to me when I can save my important things elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Home is not loading. Plus, for some reason, it logged me out without any reason and when I signed in, that's when the home page is not loading anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience taking long time to open notes not able to anote pdf crashed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One word summarises it all : HORRIBLE ! Every new version is not an improvement, instead it is an downgrade in the app quality and bad user experience. Hey, what a lousy company called Evernote !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love Evernote because even the free version is accessible across different platforms. love the clipping app. love snap a picture and add it to a note especially for documents to keep. love the tagging and the searchability."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update has completely ruined the app. It's now unusable, time to find a new notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened Evernote? This app used to be my go-to for years but recently everything seems to be crashing and notes don't get saved. Please fix !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"several years using this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"After updating , it doesn`t work .I have lost my saved informations !?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only signed up for paid version on my phone( since there is no real free option on android, so officially now hate evernote because suddenly I cannot navigate to evernote on my pc. Yes yes yes i have tried rebooting, multiple browsers, and reinstalling browers I have spent hours this but no dice. My content was being held hostage unless I signed up for a paid account on my phone. Still can't access on pc. This is just a good lesson that these services are not worth the aggravation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ห่วยแตก ใครสั่งมึงupdate ควาย"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be the best. I used it to record my daily work activities and planning my day for almost 10 years now. I never had problems with it. I could search my notes for any text and it would take me to the exact text without scrolling through the notes. I could make lines to separate my paragraphs now I can't anymore. I could scroll fast without delays now it glitches. I think in trying to make the app fancy and Morden they really compromised on the speed and reliability of the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The more update, the more buggy. Bloat UI. Trying to be everything but fail to be best at 1 thing. Paid veraion still need internet to access note, made it slow and boring to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Becoming more unusable. I use it with 2 devices so no premium. Every single time I need to back out of one note and go to another it crashes or I have to force close the app. This is becoming more frustrating coupled with an ""exclusive offer"" every time I open it. At this point I'll pay you for it to work properly on 2 devices and never give me an ""exclusive offer "" pop up again. Please fix. Going downhill fast."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update has made it not very easy to use, like it used to be. 1. The navigation within the app is slow. 2. Using the back button on the device to navigate out of a note, exits the app itself. 3. The view changes to landscape mode, even though auto-rotate is turned off. 4. Can't get rid of home screen widgets in free version. I think that much should be a basic option to provide for all users. 5. Text editing options within a note are essentially hidden. Not easy to use. Pls make it better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Nice note, but very slow on smartphone. I want a refund my subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The price increase is just insane shifted to Xtiles and Notion."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using Evernote every day, and I have a Business plan subscription. It is a great application, and after they fixed the big issue with it, it finally works well. However, customer support is completely missing, although they promise such support for Business users. Instead, they have only one chat bot that is completely useless. This company still has a long way to go to gain customer trust."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was once awesome and easy to use. The recent update has made the app CLUNKY AND SLOW. Before, you simply update a date with one touch, now you have to open the app, clear security, tap here, tap there, slide there, tap there, tap a day, tippity tap tap tap...done. And, thankfully, the update removed ALL MY HOME PAGE SHORTCUTS on my phone and replaced them with NOTHING. If you would just put 1/100th as much effort into an upgrade vs ads to buy more and give us money. Why would I subscribe again?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app over all for keeping important information to remember. Functionality is somewhat lacking, but I usually can find work arounds, but it's a hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"works smoothly, would appreciate more options to export notes (maybe haven't found them if they exist). I moved all my poetry writing to evernote and it feels good enough to continue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app since 2014 and this is the worst update I've ever experienced. Extremely clunky, it takes half a century to even start a new note entry, and it takes for ever for my notes to even synchronize. And yet I still get bombarded with ads asking me to UPGRADE. Wasn't planning on upgrading then so why would I want to upgrade now when the product is worse. Go back to to old evernote this one is trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using Evernote for almost a decade now, all my notes are still intact for all these years even though I've changed many phones. Great job guys."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is slowing down with new updates, navigation is rubbish, search function worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Anwynwyn"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"nice but some it goes hang,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The recent updates has ruined my experience. I've used Evernote since maybe 2009 and it's been great! But now the windows desktop app won't load, the android app is clunky, and the web app won't let me download my notes. I tried seeking help, but to speak to a person you have to upgrade. I tried the Community forum but it keeps routing me to create an account when I'm already signed in. The only help I have is a useless chatbot. I miss the old evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update dashed hopes of a ""fix."" Does anyone have an alternate app recommendation? This app no longer opens notes....I tried trying to figure out how to go back to the previous version, but was not able to find a way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Era la migliore ma ora Se la connessione è un po' lenta sta due ore a caricare una nota. Non hai connessione? L'applicazione non funziona. App pesantissima che si blocca spesso, dieci mila opzioni e poi devi aspettare 10 minuti per riuscire a leggere o scrivere una nota.. ogni volta che la apro mi bloccano e mi chiedono se voglio fare la prova premium, rifiuto, e lo richiedono all'infinito. si è completamente perso il senso di questa app: note facili e veloci. Trasferirò tutto da un'altra parte"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The sync is very slow. Android app crashes whenever loading notes, even on Galaxy tab S8. On iPad pro with a Magic Keyboard, the mouse flashes whenever I am typing. The overall experience is buggy. I do not recommend this app since it fails even in the basic function of note-taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good App. I like. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This used to be great, but now they've crippled it in an attempt to force subscription. Now everything that was great about it is pay-only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please bring back the old evernote which was reliable and load all images! I keep seeing images cannot b rendered error!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Suddenly Evernote didn't open anymore. I got some message about migration. Now I cannot see my notes anymore. (Have you been bought my Microsoft :-/?) After removing and reinstalling, I got my notes back. +1 star - still very bad experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After downloading new update this app has become a real headache. I couldn't open my saved notes. Whenever i try to open, it starts buffering for endless time, and doesn't open. I've almost lost my important saved data due to this recent update. Highly disappointed ! How can one think about getting a paid plan when the basic one doean't work efficiently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent note system"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very frequently I get email that someone opened my Evernote.. this app is not at all safe to store credentials. Do not use this application"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update is abysmal. Slow loading, crashes, slow I general. I have been using Evernote since the start, I hope they fix this latest version it's terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Camera capture (eg scanning a doc) is still incredibly slow, as well as most other operations. So slow it is unbearable. And cannot login by sideloading older versions of APK. Edit: NEED FOR SPEED Edit: Did you disable the camera scanning feature on older versions of Evernote (v.8)?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for nearly a decade. If you'd have asked a year ago, I'd have given it 4 stars, with one removed due to the incessant and intrusive premium ads. But over the past few weeks, it's become nearly unusable, with a typed sentence taking a half-minute to render on screen. Try to do more than a sentence at a time, and you'll lose your note with a crash. The slowness also manifests as battery drain. Some saved work will also disappear. Suffice it to say, caveat emptor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bring back the password for the app. This is an absolute need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trying to cancel my account. Proving impossible. Wasted so much time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too damn slow and they make it impossible to delete your account with the no of steps and failures, hope this company rots."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"please is it that the only way to use evernote now is by subscription hence no more evernote free?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I've been using this app since 2015. Many issues along the way. The final nail to the coffin just happened: while my phone was in my pocket my unintentional touches deleted the note that I've used daily for over a year as agenda and general notepad. It saved it too. There's no way to retrieve an old version, the app doesn't track changelogs unless you pay loads. It's sad because replicating the note from memory will take me 40-80 hours. This app is a moneycow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow to load, still. As of Sep 2023."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Log in issue .... Kindly solve it.. My account is not log from any device..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Needs and email to start, I don't want to use my email, therefore the app is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hate the new AP. Have used Evernote for years and loved it. HATE, HATE, HATE the new and awful change."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"no DOWNGRADE or sideload locked via mac or IP after buggy update?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used since 2011, was good, but now terrible. No longer syncs with phone. Text and photos have just disappeared. Using a new app. Do not trust this one anymore. Back up all of your stuff elsewhere if you use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Sadly worst than I remember."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Just having great experience with it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aare you guys for real? I have been using this app for ages and now all that I've documented over the years is lost because y'all are greedily pushing people to buy a premium subscription by not loading their notes. This is truly pathetic and hope y'all face leagl repercussions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very poor , pathetic unable to open saved notes ..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ALWAYS WHITE SCREEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS, WHAT HAPPENED???????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Sürekli note uyuşmazlığı oluyor ve ara yüzü yeterince basit değil. Ayarlar sekmesi mesela çok karmaşık Tüm buglardan bunaldım artık. Başka bir not uygulamasına geçmem gerek. Şimdilik maalesef sevdiğim ama hatalardan yıldığım Evernote'dan devam. Cihazımın optimasyonuyla ilgili bir takım sıkıntılar olmuş galiba. Diğer kusurlarıyla beraber en az bi 3-4 puanı hak ediyor Cihazımdaki batarya ve mobil datayla ilgili tüm engelleri kaldırdım. Cayır cayır çalışıyor. Umarım çok şarj ve data yemez 4 puan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am an everynote power user and just take notes 24/7 but the sync is bad, i have lost notes so many times and sometimes i feel i have lost something but I can't recall for the life of me what i forgot, it is super slow, and at this point I'll switch from evernote but good for you there is no better alternative P.S. have tried notion, one note etc. Idk either rewrite the whole thing again in java or whatever but get it working, these are the reasons stopping me from actually paying for this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I hate this new version.. you developers are doing too much. Youre trying to be too EXTRA! Go back to the previous version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like it but the sidebar is so annoying. When I am writing in my notes and press the sidebar by accident I can't swipe it away so I have to exit the note everytime. Please add a button to close the sidebar (the one on the left)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Desktop version is fine, but the mobile app is terrible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update: The app has become painfully slow. Opening a notebook takes 5-10 seconds. The background sync is still not available. I mostly use Evernote on my laptop, and the widget on my phone to jot quick notes. After opening the app, it takes up to a minute to sync everything which is not reasonable for use when you need to see something, quickly. The ""recently updated"" widget is out of date until I open the app, which beats the purpose."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is good, but lately notes are opening very slowly or only on my 2nd attempt. Its annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has been working fine forever, but since today I can't use it because it crashes within 1,5 seconds after I open it. I've tried deleting cache and restarting my phone, but nothing works. Unable to access my notes. This is version 10.53.3 on Android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why I am not able to fetch my existing notes. Only text are fetched not even some time that also. Notes that contain images are not able to fetch. Also when I open it they always ask to upgrade. If this is the case who will even upgrade I wonder. This app is degrading day by day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote across all devices, sync, blah blah blah. You need to pay to keep sync across multiple devices, which is the very reason I installed it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Users should not be required to sign up and sign-in just to try this app. 👎🏼"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've been use this for many year but recently i can't sign in to another device with the same email"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for nearly 14 years. Now it's time for me to move on to other simpler solutions. My brain cannot keep up with the constant changes in the UI. Every time they roll out a new update I have to re-learn how to use this app and get acquainted with the new UI. I don't use this app because it's FUN. I just wanted something simple so I can access my notes real quick when I need them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently, every note is so slow to load regardless of my connection. Note creation is excruciatingly slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATING MY FIVE STAR REVIEW!!! First of, for a notepad app, the new updated UI is inconvenient! Second thing, WHY CAN I NOT ACCESS ANY OF MY NOTES!!!!??? NEVER LOADS ANY NOTE I OPEN! I have been using this for years now, and have some important stuff in there which I cannot access now!!! That's the problem with any and all mobile app developers! Bringing trash updates to good apps that were neither required, nor asked for!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"One.of the must trusted app is now down...I have used it since years but now adays it is not as great it used to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't access to my notes on android phone but no problem on ipad. Dont know why and how do i fix or where can i ask for help. Evernote was good on free version until i subscribed, it turn worst and non function anymore. Sometimes it copy note by itself for no reason that make me confuse which is the real and update. Looking for the new app that work more smooth and less problem. The latest subscription will be the last time i paid for this app, no more evernote ever and ever on my android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love this note app I have had it for years now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Amazing how slow a note taking app even be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"For several years I found Evernote a helpful and reliable app. Over time alongside useful updates a few features were moved behind pay walls and some restrictions were tightened. This is a nature of things. Some worrisome changes have been happening lately however. I have been finding that edits made to files have vanished. In some cases the files entirely have vanished. If it happened a couple of times I would suspect user error, but the regularity of the bugginess might just end my usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think it must have been better in 2014 when i started using it. No longer syncs automatically. If you don't have a strong internet connection and want to look up the grocery list you made last night, no dice. I've been waiting for a note to load for 10 minutes now, on WiFi."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using this for years, however perhaps I should give up as it is still glitchy! It seems that every time I start using it more frequently and start relying more on it, it has issues. Today, the note I shared with my partner is blank. No photos attached (there were 4) and NO text apart from the title."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"n'arrete pas de proposer des options payantes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes didn't want to open and took too much time to load."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I somehow subscribed through Google Play. The price is doubling. Yet somehow I cannot cancel it. This is a horrible designed system, and the bummer is I lose all my Evernote data that I have spent years curating. Ugh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"veRy veRy good app for saving your work and creating written content. loved it. the only fault is that it sometimes becomes laggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes not loading and getting saved"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Overall it is a good notes app, but not worth 18 dollars a month. I can get the same thing elsewhere for free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"12/2022: Awesome app, great way to make memos throughout the day, good options for organizing. My one complaint is that the notes tend to get buggy if they become too long - the text starts lagging when I'm typing and introduces errors (letters I didn't type) - it seems to also be related to the keyboard I'm using too (Samsung vs Gboard) as the bugs get better when I switch back to Samsung. Update 09/2023: the app frequently erases new notes and added info. Must be a server issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Too long to loading a notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bugs, after bugs, after bugs. You click, nothing happens, you want a new note, it hangs. Want to select a piece of text, it refuses, want to check a task, it also unchecks the one above. Honestly is there anything you can do right? Switching to an app built by engineers who actually test their code"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a mess. It takes hell of a time to sync and multiple copies of notes are created on its own. This was the best place to work with as I am using it since 2017 I believe but it's just not it now. App needs some serious changes and bugs needs to be removed otherwise this will no longer be used by anyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be brilliant but now keep asking upgrade and not functional any more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to love this but lately you can't go from one note to another without closing the app out. I'm assuming it's a way to get you to purchase a subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Bunraner"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app over 4 years and now they want me to pay for it. That's unfair. I'm going to delete it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please update your app. It's been problematic for a month already. It keeps on crashing on my android phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app keeps having problem saving notes. it was better before but now the problem is getting worse"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Reasonably good notebook"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good for almost everything. But it doesn't work on any Samsung devices with stylus for handwriting. Surprisingly, the developer doesn't have any timeline of when this will be done. That's shame, because Samsung Galaxy devices are so popular for their stylus, and Evernote completely ignored it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Reviews are"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The last number of years the constant barrage of ads asking you to upgrade to premium while trying to access your information has made continuing to use Evernote untenable. Currently lookong for a better solution to this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please bring back the lock feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I email my notes to myself and now I can't open my notes in the email. I'm not happy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very handy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frozen. Blank screen displaying nothing. Bad that y'all guys are fading to black now that you have serious competition in Notion, OneNote etc. How could you deploy a cloud solution that we can't access via mobile devices or the PC? Well done, brainiacs!😏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love It. ✌🫶🫰"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was going to download and install Evernote based on recommendations by other writers that gave it high praise. I read many many many recent reviews and have decided NOT to download this at this time. Seems it used to be an amazing app but not so much anymore. Oh well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst worst worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Almost useless on Chromebook. Unstable and keeps crashing. Shame because I love the idea and wanted to use it for note taking for Night School and some of my hobbies."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Popups don't stop. Just let me get to the notes damn it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Spent more than an hour writing in a note only for it all to disappear. All that time wasted and when I went to pull up note history in hopes of recovering it I'm told I have to pay 10 a month to get my note back. I can have the same ability on other programs and apps for free when I lose my work. Crazy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Regreted update the new version,.. been using for years,.. the new UI is frustuated,.. see lesser list of my notes,..open notes takes longer, sometime hang... press back button direct exit apps instead of main pagè list of note,.. time to migrate to other app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"V.good Apps 5*****Evernote is my old friend. I gave a review of this app 10 years ago. Since then till today, I have not left this app. Thanks Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using it for years but it has become trash. On my mobile it's crashing almost every day and storing/ syncing has become unreliable. I miss notes that I have made."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note keeping app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not updating the app due to all the bugs the latest version has, and now there's a message inside the app telling me to update. At least the old version works, does Evernote want me to leave the app altogether by experiencing a buggy version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This annual subscription is a waste of money. This app is inferior to most free apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using this app for a while couple of years now, I've been using it to write my songs and upload some beat and then I synced my songs till today I wanted to go back to some of my songs I wrote some months ago, I could only find the lyrics I wrote I couldn't download redownload the beat even as its showing in the note page, and the beat was also synced 😔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect for keeping Notes & syncing to All Pc's or Smartphones. Love It & it's Free!! LOL! It was Free! It's not now and I'm dropping it once I unload all my notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is the best app I ever use for note but nowadays app is not opening please solve this issue as soon as possible. May be time to find alternate option for this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updates have ruined the app. Used to be a great app, really user friendly, simple to use and a great layout, but it isn't anymore. On the search for a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not sure what's happening with this app but now unable to copy note contents and paste outside of Evernote, and when you select text and delete much more text gets deleted then highlighted. These are pretty basic and crucial functions I would have thought."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Could not access my account without prompting for payment so I'm screwed on the work I have saved on my account. Sorry, can't afford at the moment even with a free trial. it is what it is."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Almost good, too bad it has no support for writing with the pen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my favorite app to save notes. But now images don't load. Very disappointing. I'll update my review if problem is resolved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an EVERNOTE user since 2009. For the last few years, the android app has been getting worse and worse, it's unresponsive. What bothers me the most is that it almost always fails to open attached PDF attachments with the message ""Cannot open PDF..."". It only helps if I clear the cache and data in the application. Then it works fine for a while. This is very annoying and useless to me. On top of all that, my bill will increase by 100 %. It is too much, JOPLIN is next..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for many years and with the recent update, where widgets are introduced and upgrade is required in order to save changes, this has become so annoying to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used to use evernote years ago and loved it, so I was excited to re-download. The amount of ads I get asking me to upgrade to premium is excessive, especially when you have to press a second prompt to get it to go away. Can barely use the free version without getting ads long enough to see if I would even want to buy the paid version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Dependable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became buggy and unusable. Notes disappear, edits revert by themselves. Would not recommend"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years but recently it's become useless. It has slowed down significantly, it spams you with demands to upgrade to premium and now it's not even saving the things I've written despite me clicking on the tick."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this app since many years and was happy using it...But since last few months I am fed up.of Evernote... Nothing can open without a trouble!! It takes so much time to open any notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote used to be great, running simple and fast. It's not usable anymore since force upgrade to v10. New version doesn't work well with back button, most of the time it simply quit the app. Very often it cannot load a short text note because it doesn't save offline copy unless upgrade to premium. It also changes display orientation even system setting is off. There is a bunch of useless things on home view you cannot remove or change unless upgrade & pay. Time to say goodbye after a decade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thank you for completing the requirements as desired. Now Evernote so versatile. Add multi colours to pen and for different types of files and labels for ease identifying as done for tablet format"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Let's you copy information quickly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps losing notes and associated images. Frustrating and expensive. Looking for an alternative. Huge price hike imminent too!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sept. 3: passcode is back but now app keeps on crashing, I don't know what's happening but whoever are the new people in charge they're quickly ruining a once near-perfect app into something unreliable August 17: Trade one issue for another passcode missing for over a month, what a mess this app has become ...

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have to say that the customer service is surprisingly great. I had automatic renewal on this but thought I had changed to a lower subscription. When I got the yearly charge, I was upset and sent an email to customer service. They pointed out that the account associated with my billing was a completely different account! In my jaded response, I was sure that I would have to pay for another year. However, Blake M. helped me tremendously and I did NOT have to pay for the higher subscription! TY!!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has a lot of potential but it crashes constantly. When I am paying 17.99 a month for this service, I need to be able to use it. This is useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All of my notes were deleted. I heard Obsidian is better, so I'll be switching to them instead of starting over with this unreliable trash app. I hope it doesn't do the same to others."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't find a place to email the developers and the send feedback button doesn't work, just pulls up a tray full of apps to choose, so here I am. Been using this app for ten years. Stop asking me to upgrade. I am not upgrading. I will never upgrade. I have no need to upgrade. Give me an option to opt out of the prompts. Skip trial -> ""You will not be able to get this offer back"" - yeah until next week when you try me on again. Stop it and I'll give a proper rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for years and i think I'm done. Too many problems. Slow sync, slow other stuff, duplicate notes, trouble signing in.. Google drive just works so much better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very poor experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is unable to take the input of the S-pen and it constantly messes up the list which I am trying to creat.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fir some unknown reason, my notes won't load without backing out, finding the note again, and clicking on it a second time...big pain!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it for years, but now it's totally different and much worse. It's not a notepad anymore, some hybrid that tries to be everything and fails in all those attempts. So why should I even think about paid version if it doesn't work on free. And it take ages to load, sometimes don't load at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Lenta, se atasca, muchos problemas. Hace muchos años que tengo Evernote pero esto parece que va a peor. Desinstalando la app y reinstalando, vuelve a ir bien."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app started out great... but it charges now to sync across devices? You gotta be kidding. The convenience of moving from my phone to PC to Tablet is now lost. I'm moving apps now. Everything in this app is now behind a pay wall feature"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app was good, very good IN THE PAST. But lately, some error occurs... The app sometimes did not record my last keystroke before I switched to other apps. But the worst experience is that the app keeps showing the offer to switch to premium service... Everyday... Again n Again. Now, found another new Note app, will slowly migrate the notes to the new found app..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,",👍👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good - then I decided to pay for it.. and now I have all sorts of problems. As others have noted it is extremely slow to load. I capture photos of my scrapbook inventory.. and suddenly if I go back to edit.. the photo ""will not render"". Can't see it. It's now useless. I am going to cancel and use OneNote instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I am loving this app. I could easily scribble my thoughts. 🤍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Impossible to unsynch devices. Made the mistake of logging in on 2 computers and my phone. Now, every time I use the app it forces me to unsynch one of the devices. Ok, no problem. Then the next day, gotta unsynch again. Then again. Finally completely uninstalled the app on one of my computers (including deleting registry files). Nope, still gotta unsynch every time. Now I'm locked out of the account on my main computer. I've deleted it from my second computer. Only my phone works now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Non funziona più - doesnt work"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote has been degrading over last few years. Sync doesn't happen, notes disappear, super slow both on phone and desktop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You finally did it, you made Evernote so unusable that I'm just going to cold turkey stop using it from today forward. What a horrible end to a once great product."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I spent an hour writing and editing a note, but after I finished and tapped done, I find that none of it had saved aside from the title. A pic that I inputted is displayed in the preview, but that is also nowhere to be found once I actually tap the note. Needless to say, I am infuriated by my experience and I question the app's reliability if these errors could occur, if all of the time and effort that I give can just become wasted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Loved Evernote for years because I was able to save my notes securely and the information transferred to my other devices. Now it is no longer password protected and I am in search of another program."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not working on Android anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too long to access notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Original 2014 review: ""I keep all my devices synced together so I always have access to all my notes all the time. I'm a big fan."" 2023 update: I still use this, but the pricing has gone way up, the software is still decent. I'm knocking a star off because I liked it better then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You need an account to make notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly deletes my notes, and when I adk for help recovering my notes, the customer support simply says oh yeah weve been having that problem. Cant get my notes back for my college courses. GARBAGE APP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used Evernote for many years but now it I time to drop it! The app has become so useless with incessant upgrade prompts and endless white screens. Time to move my notes to Samsung Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't ever move a note from the general notebook to a stack notebook, when i choose to view notebooks in the stack it shows me nothing an emptiness! This app is becoming unusable with the slow loading time I am indeed thinking of an alternative"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot open old notes anymore without paying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for years fine. But unusable for the last few months, unless you pay. Constantly have to manually sync for the notes to appear. Useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"slow, compared to google keep and lack of good ""search and jump to"" feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"2023 update. There has been a noticable improvement in syncing and clipping over the past six months. so I am increasing my score. Using the same phone, tablet and pc as when I reviewed in 2021 I am seeing a more usable experience. I hope this is a sign of further fixes . (2021 review) This product is rapidly deteriorating. Functions are being removed and glitches are growing. What was a fantastic app in 2012-2015 is becoming useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app just gets worse and worse. It's so laggy it's nearly impossible to use. Now I can't create new notes anymore, and I can't use the back button without the app lagging tf out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"loads very slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please stop bothering me about free trial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's suddenly broken. I use the app all of the time, and now it just simply won't work. Can't make new notes, can't load old ones, and can't login to the website because my license isn't good for another ""Device."" Going to the support website indicated that chat is unavailable due to the number of customers being served. No notice on the website about a system being down, and it's been down for weeks. The reviews are indicating I'm not the only guy with this problem; why the silence?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Trash app that is a shadow of it's former self. Makes me sad to see the state it's in. Also who tf decides auto rotate is something that is mandatory to have on? What year is it, 2012?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is not ok. Issues loading notes, back kills the app to the point where it feels like it crashed. Not sure why I'm paying them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Sometimes I can't open it at all. I'm not sure exactly why. And they removed three times a quote I saved by Brigham Young about being deceived if you give up your guns. And you will sleep until you are slain. But other than that it's great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Note sort in notebook doesn’t work. General slow response rate of most actions. Given the price, should function better and more nimbly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I think the app is finally dead and don't work anymore. It never login. What a shame. Once good app is Dead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Okay app. Has 3 big issues: (1) Does not honor requests to stay dormant, so it consumes battery (and a little data) even when you tell it to not start on its own in the background. (2) Offline functionality is very limited. Likely developed by people who are always online without consideration that many people are not interested in that. (3) Pushes unwanted ad (promo) notifications that can only be turned off by turning off all notifications for the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Does not even heard bout it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the latest version of the app has a bug where you can't even create new notes anymore. the widget integration broke recently where you think you're creating a note and it doesn't get saved."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good... but not now. It's so slow now, creating new notes is so slow or sometimes not possible. Almost unusable. What has gone wrong?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used Evernote for probably 8 years. I'd be lost without my notes! I love the search option. It makes finding my notes easy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the great app. But as other reviews said, it gets worse with every update. It doesn't matter what fancy features developers dream up if the apps core functions are not working. E. g., It takes forever (many minutes) to create a new note, even blank one. So many bugs. Do Evernote developers even use their own app or have they all switched to Notion? Looking for alternatives after being a paying subscriber for many years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Back to five stars after a difficult upgrade."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pc에서 쓴 글을 앱에서 수정했더니 제 글 절반이 삭제되었습니다. 복구 안됩니다. 한여름 밤의 꿈이 이런건가"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My favorite note app. Been using it for years and have it incorporated into my productivity systems. I'll probably be using it the rest of my life, and so far I'm only using the basic functions. It's a much more powerful platform than what I've explored so far. One feature I would like to see added is just one extra layer of file structure. Currently the file structure is three layers deep. Stacks > Notebooks > Notes. Occasionally I find this lacking and could really use one more layer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very y useful for me, 1 thing the I hate the most is you can't change the data while your offline as a FREE USER."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Getting worse with every update. Slow, lags, unreliable. And I am a paying customer! But no more. Such a pitty"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE: Worked fine for about a year after some patches but now I've bought a new phone and the screen won't even open. I'm completely unable to access my notes. This is frustrating. ORIGINAL: Stop breaking it with updates! This app was my favorite app and has a ton of notes stored, but for the last year it's been having issues, and the past week I can't even paste a link without it crashing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"They might as well call it EverBug- The app has good features in principle. But is extremely buggy. Which makes it a frustrating one to use. You can lose whole notes for no reason. And may get cold shoulder from support too. Even after buying the paid plan. The only reason to use it is to not have another app like this in the app store at this point. The moment a better performing app is in the market, this one will vanish."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deleted the first day I installed it. It was an ok note taking app with mulitiple restrictions on the free plan, especially 60mb upload limit per month. Given today's option, you can easily get much better offers from other apps. Paid plan of other apps offer premium features, while evernote wants to provide basic features with the paid plan. Good luck Evernote"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Grindr App"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After a decade, so long evernote. What a garbage, freezing, buggy app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open the app without being asked to buy yet another limited time, never to be repeated upgrade offer. Have to dismiss the ad multiple times before starting the simplest of tasks. Then pops the ad up again in the middle of completing a task. Are you really creating happy users, or just cementing their position to not upgrade?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app to keep home inventory and note taking. I enjou the organization. The reason i did not give it a 5 star. Is the image management."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is the culmination of my search for a notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am so angry with how this app went downhill. I used it to keep important notes and everything really, and now it won't save a basic note?? And it's always trying to get me to pay?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Smooth installation. I'll comment more after I have a chance to work with it. 😏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not user friendly by app design. Not intuitive and easy to use. Redesign it!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"See! you say it either free or a paid one. After installing the app it demands for compulsory purchase order, with our banking details, then only 7 days trial. What's this nonsense? Google Play shall not allow such confused way of app installations. I am uninstalling now..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"8-2023. Sketch using a stylus on a Note 10 is broken. Cannot write. Was charged $140 renewal fee, double my usual annual fee $70. Crazy expensive. Will be looking elsewhere soon 2-14-22 webclipper continues to malfunction. Cannot select folder or change tag. (Might work if I uninstall and reinstall evernote. Premiun user for years. I just tried to Search on Android and it just spins. What keeps me on Evernote is their Search capabilities to scan notes for things even hand written stuff."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"my most useful apps ..very easy to use...write notes .. useful in iPad and Android both....issue is with editing mode being turned on immediately after taking a note... sometimes unintentionally we may correct a note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"works well, stores all my notes well, not even a premium member"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"All notes at one place, very useful app. No more value for money ! They have increased prices by 4 times in 10 years ! Hence looking for alternative like one note or apple notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't send email invites, send button greyed out People cant edit notes when shared via whatsapp What is the point of this app? Inbuilt note apps are better than this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is the app not working properly? Suddenly you can't access the notes anymore, it's too slow. I think Evernote was already"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great app, I have used it for most of my life and have advocated for it anytime I could. Now, we get more and more bugs with every single update and end up losing important notes due to an incompetence that is nothing less than lamentable. What are you people doing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for over 7 years and this new upgrade is just the worst! I really used to look forward to opening it but now I'm uninterested. The app is no longer well secured and it has just been really difficult to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally deleted 3 hours of writing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"8/26/2023 Further bullsnot: Verge who rated it high, now says BAIL! and tells you how. **Company was sold off to European interests** BELIEVE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! 8/2022: Now about useless as ***s after last rev.

Was my fave for 10 or so years, now it sucks @$$. They misspelled Nevernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow Slow Slow impossibly slow. Often won't let me share to a note or create a note from scratch. Have uninstalled and reinstalled etc. Looking for backup options and alternatives to migrate my content if this goes on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently become awful. Slow and glitchy. Also asks you to join premium every time you open the app. I will be moving to one note."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"No longer able to create notes with the Android app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Seems slow to load notes sometimes but has improved in the past little while. Sometimes searching for a note will not clear away on the website version, so I can't see all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had this app for years and have very important information related to my mom's health and now either I can't even get to my notebooks or the information doesn't even save, but the pop ups to purchase more never missed a beat! Absolutely a terrible experience the last year or two and would say go elsewhere. Now I'm stuck trying to export all my notes to safety! This app has helped cause me more stress while caring for my mother fighting cancer. Greed runs the world now and it's sad!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Honestly, I couldn't even enjoy testing the app out before upgrading because of the frequent pop up ads to upgrade! Deleted, I'll just use the notes app already installed on my phone 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app isn't particularly responsive after the last update; it takes too much time to load notes, starting a new note the app will not respond well and the keypad won't load up"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used Evernote for years. But lately it's been getting worse and worse. And today, couldn't create any new notes at all. Extremely disappointing 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't pay for the app. The notes are going to take ages to load anyway. And if you have a slow internet connection, bid the app adieu for good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is the last review before delete the app, now the app pop up every 10 second to ask join premium plan, which is annoying and unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Just as the recent comments said, the app recently takes so long to load and I haven't been able to open any note. I heavily rely on it so hope they will be fixing the problem soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not reliable, I've written a note, a poem, evernote deleted the whole content after saving, and obviously, this is not recoverable. Evernote team, I will delete this review if you can recover my poem. Otherwise, you fail at the most important thing, which is actually saving text. (This happened 10min ago, so if you could retrieve it from debug or logs, and send it to me by email, or recover in app, I will delete this review)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"You can't email saved documents with the free version. Instructions not clear, I watched 3 tutorials to help me figure it out. And, frankly, there must be a need for indepedent people to make these tutorials ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uninstalled after 6 years. Used to be an amazing app but now it has constant sync issues, doesn't always save edits and sometimes goes offline entirely while I'm connected to WiFi. Such a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is horrible the password code don't even work plus notion is so much better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dont UPDATE! Terrible now..wont even open had been bad for awhile... deleting notes on its own etc but unusable now. Had this app for Sooo many years and had tons saved on it...all gone! 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used this app for over a decade. It has gotten steadily worse over the last few years to where it is now unusable. Slow, unreliable, and glitchy. Planning on stopping my subscription and finding something new. Disappointing as I have over 1000 notes that I'll need to figure out what to do with. This used to be my favorite utility app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time i try to use this app, it always reminds me to upgrade the plans, i cant go back to use my note, it'sannoying 😡. So I can't use it anymore. Sorry, Evernote 😐, I have to log out and uninstall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Found a good alternative with Joplin! A shame that Evernote just couldn't seem to get back on track. They used to be really good, but it's not been working for many months now. You would think they'd work out a solution after so many bad reviews? Anyway, finally found a good alternative app that let's you save websites into different folders, so I'm happy! Hope this helps someone else too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I guess I'm not the only one who hates this app from the last month It worked perfectly until a few days ago since it doesn't load my notes, doesn't create any note It sucks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*Update 8/25/2023 - This app is still horrible and don't believe for a second that support can help you. This app is continually buggy. Especially in the area of saving notes. A significant percentage of the time it won't save the note at all. I have wasted so much time trying to get this to work. I have taken a long time before leaving this review. But I cannot recommend this app - it basically continually fails to work in basic functionality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote too frequently losts my notes without possibility to restore."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was a faithful Evernote user for more than a decade, now abandoned Evernote in favour of Joplin. Honestly, Joplin is both faster (by a wide margin) and stable than Evernote. Today I opened Evernote for the first time in months after having downgraded to the free version, and was immediately buried in popups requesting to become a paying customer. As for my notes, they wouldn't even load, and when they did, it was after looking at a loading screen for 30 secs. Useless. I made the right decision."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App running slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"crazy awesome app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App auto rotates even though it is disabled system wide, very annoying. Edit- changed to one star, now the app freezes upon creating a new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"white screen of death, crashes, and worst of all - sometimes it just doesn't save changes in notes!!! p.s. I'm using the latest version, Samsung A72"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used this app for years, after the most recent updates the notes stopped loading, edited my review to reflect that. this combined with only the legacy version of the desktop app working means it's time to find a replacement"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Offline notes are the only reason I chose this application over others, so why now have you removed that and added it as a ""premium"" feature? If this is not resolved soon I will ditch this app and recommend another to myself and friends. What were you thinking, no normal person will pay anything whatsoever monthly to take notes, seriously notes! my gosh you're crazy. Only people in business and such with great note taking needs would ever opt to do such a thing!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very useful. Usually easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app, impossible to remove from my device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since they want us to pay for their services I always have problems with the app. It takes me forever to open it, I just lost my notes (yesterday where saved and today I wanted to read them and they are gone) and I also can't find another ones. I'll change this app for another one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"There is a lot I like about Evernote both on Android and on PC. There is one glaring omission on Android that they don't seem to have thought of. We need a way to jump to the end of a note. In a long note, it takes a lot of scrolling down to get to the end. On PC there are keyboard shortcuts to do so but not on Android. Please make it possible to jump to the end of a long note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was the BEST notes app until IT WASN'T! I reached out to Evernote multiple times to explain how horrible things have become. Whoever is managing this app obviously doesn’t use it because if they did, they would put it back to what it was before they trashed it!! Workflow is cumbersome. Notes don't load. Notes don't save. The whole app moves super slow. I have done everything I know to do. Another App Bites The Dust! Bye 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*Edit: Lock screen is still disabled. I was charged $14.60 for upgrading, yet, it's still asking me to upgrade. 😒 Awful. What's going on?? I just had to reinstall this app because I was just getting a blank screen, and now it's glitching!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost all my notes, and the app is forcing me to pay. Maybe if I pay, I will get back my information. I was a happy user of the app for the last 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"tired of these interruptions. go away or lose a customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Error loading page. Cannot open my notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't create new notes or even open existing ones anymore. It keeps hanging on the loading screen. Also, Evernote has a very, very slow sync. (Both the free and paid version.) Don't have a choice but to migrate to Notion. Bummer. Evernote used to be my favorite note app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is the way to do research and remember not just day to day but for a future that has yet to come. Clipping is the best!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Your app is so so SLOW now since last 2 months.. what r u guys doing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app out and so easy to use for us network marketing professionals ✨️🙏✨️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"this app is clunky and never works. I even pay for it. super disappointing, yet so promising in concept."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Couldn't live without it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tried to use as a substitute for GoodNotes. not nearly as customizable and they're asking for way more money. Predatory. They also make it difficult to cancel your subscription or even just delete your account. I spent more time jumping through hoops to delete my account than i did downloading the app and testing the features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote before v10: fast and reliable with a solid set of features; Evernote after 2 years of v10: slow and clunky with constant note lost and bloated useless new features. The app even becomes more unbearable with each of its update. Now you need 60 seconds to create an EMPTY note, what a joke company"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"We need note management, and to-do list management, and hide those which have been done, only show those tasks need to be finished. Edit: I hate that I can't turn off auto-rotate in Evernote. There is no options or settings for you to change that in the app. By the way I am using Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, turning the auto-rotate off from the phone settings doesn't change Evernote's in-app auto-rotate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote on Android - specifically one+9 has gone to the dogs ... it's slow as hell, I can't write notes anymore as every time I try the screen is blank and the loading wheel never stops, while saving a task it's the same slowness... it takes forever to save one line task on Evernote now. making complaints to Support only gets bots and no solution...I think Evernote is now on a Bot command and all humans have left the company, time for customers to leave too- i guess . using Evernote for 10 yrs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Channel you tube"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"can be hard to understand and navigate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I am come back after my bad reviews... Overall, the app is good, better than before... Keep it up!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Has become unusable. Mine are alphabetized. Once it reaches the H's, it repeats the same title over and over as I swipe up it get past that note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Glichy and unreliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App unusably slow with phone upgrade (S23 Ultra). Creating ""new note"" loaded but with no writing field. Now I have 5 notes with no text as it tried to make a note but couldn't. Opening existing note - shows text in preview, but could not display text whel selecting go open note. 11+ years on this app. Worst update ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Each update makes the app worse and more and more unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"OK, but it will be better ;)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app is dreadful this morning, and does seem to be getting worse. I had numerous ideas to quickly get down, so opened the app clicked on new and waited.. and waited... I closed the app and started again. Eventually I got an editor to create a new note. One lovely feature of the editor is that if you select words to replace & start typing it deletes a bunch of text ahead of it that you didn't select. On top of that this morning I can't open any of my existing notes. I tap and nothing opens."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for many years. In the past 2 years or so, suddenly the storage is purely online, and none of the notes can be loaded , app glitches out when saving a new note, and just overall so many glitches. It was a great app, why did you have to ruin it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote has become rather buggy over time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love Evernote. Have been using it for 11 years. It appears they recently forgot the basics of what people want out of this app (note taking across devices that just works, online and offline), screwed that part up and instead added all types of ancillary functionality that nobody cares about. I'm about to cancel."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Highly overrated app! Not at all easy to use, Very slow, It even don't have basic ""select"" option! Literally trash! Don't know why and how people are still using this!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"the ads and pop ups are getting a little much. In the middle of typing notes and repeatedly get my typing interrupted by useless ads that could be sent via email Instead. Disappointing as I've been using this app almost 10 years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You took me 1,450 THB since 19 AUG 2023 4 days ago but my account level is still ""Evernote Free"" when it should have been ""Evernote Professional"" a long time ago. But it's been silent for more than 48 hours since I tried to contact you to resolve this matter. I wasted my time. Someone recommended me to use it for free. But I'm willing to pay annually. But instead of getting better service I have to claim my rights What is this ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Cannot currently type in notes. Not working well in general. Bugs in latest update?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Can you please provide password protection for this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Back to 1 star. Unusable app! --- Going from one to two stars, the back button issue is fixed now. ---- This used to be a good app before the major design chande they made. For a long time already (maybe more than a year) notes CANNOT be downloaded for offline use and back button on S21 is not working. Contacted support, even recorded videos for them showing the problem. No results for such a long time already. Now its barely usable app. And I am a paying customer... shame!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sad as a note app goes. It's like nobody even tried to use it on Android. The constant keyboard popping up and preventing me from hitting back. They haven't been improving much either. The super slow loading. Difficult navigation. Constant badgering trying to get more money, holding my data hostage. Pretty unusable when the Internet isn't good either. This morning on good Internet it isn't even loading images I have. I'm done with this, moving back to Keep. Might consider Joplin or Obsidian"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Heavy, slow app. And now won't load old notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer usable. I've used Evernote for years and in the past couple months it's become completely unusable. First it was the constant ""upgrade to Premium"" reminders, which never go away no matter how many times you select ""Never show me this again"" (!). In recent weeks it's become unbelievably slow both on mobile and Web; it won't load or open notes at all, which kind of defeats the purpose of an app for jotting things down. Moving to OneNote ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bugs with every new update, affecting even the basic features like viewing notes. Some of my notes doesn't load, the notebook tab overlap onto the notes making half of the notes not visible vertically."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why does it take more than 1 day to sync across devices??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app - slow, crashes, freezes, loses data. Y'all really need to use a database designed for scale and performance like Cassandra. (That's what Apple notes uses for iCloud.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I come back to edit my review. This app becomes bad these days. It let users pay by a terrible way: fake email about unauthorised log in, then automatically log out continuosly. I had to pay for a month to have time to save all my notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Lack of congruence while editing and creating New data. Between Laptop 💻 and Mobile 📱 requires reorientation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The latest update didn't fix the white screen after launching the app, (ironically now I get two white screens instead of one, 1 on app start up and the other after logging in with the passcode)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a student and was hoping this would help me organize, but there's only a few basic things you can do unless you pay to have actual good options"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had this app for a long time, and now I can't even use it. At first I had this debug screen, and when I installed and reinstalled the app it shows I have to subscribe to even use the app on my phone. I normally would subscribe just so I get get my writings back but looking through other people's experiences with that debug screen it's not even worth keeping at this point."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update Aug 2023. Plan rates just increased 72% w/ no added benefits that I can ascertain. They sent an email touting real-time synchronicity, but essentially it already did this. Time to find new organizer. F no Update March 2022.. App is super glitchy lately. Selected several images from gallery to share in a note and the images have not uploaded correctly. Only shows the file info but not viewable. Also keep skipping around while I'm typing. Love using this app on both my phone and laptop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update frustrating. Can't take photos in note now. Photos taken while Evernote app is open are now confirmed after app is closed, whether to save or not, but are not saved to specific note, but just to Evernote... They need to be in specific note like before! Not happy with this update! 2023. I updated the app on my computer & now can't use Evernote there. Mobile version still works but I'm refusing to update it. Trying 2 update 2 my new email without success.So many bugs &no support"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update 8/21/23 So sad you have to pay now. I have to subscribe to get all of my notes saved to a different program. Really disappointing. I have loved Evernote since my first computer! I was thrilled to have it on my first personal organizer! I don't know what I'd do without it. It keeps getting better and easier to use, I recommend it to everyone I know and I know you will love it too!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unable to access Evernote online. All I see is a blank white screen. It's is only available on my phone. Between the intrusive upgrade requests ('offers') and the last few updates which have resulted in a very buggy app I can not access it at all on my laptop. Why would anyone upgrade an app that is not working? And the help section offers chat or email support only for paid members. Otherwise we're all SOL it seems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Basic text entry is broken and has been for months. If you select some text and delete it, you delete ~2x the characters. If you overwrite the selected text, same issue. It's clear no one at Evernote even uses the Android app on a daily basis."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible with the basics. Glitches with copy and paste. Won't save my updated text even after I save multiple times. Frustrating and unreliable app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Amazing app. Just need to fix the bugs, specially when editing or using checklists."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like it but it operates inconsistently."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most irritating part about this app is slow loading and unavailability in offline mode. Since I already have too many notes, otherwise would have ditched it long ago."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience I've ever had with an app period. Horrible UI that closes the entire app when you press back no matter what menu you're in, nothing loads, nothing syncs properly, inviting others to a note flat out doesn't work.... the developers of this trash should be banned from ever making anything as long as they live."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If my phone's orientation is locked trust me I don't want your app do the kind gesture of rotating my phone every I tilt slightly. And why is this app heavier and slower than Notion which has 10x more functionality than whatever junk this thing is? Nice UI but trust me I want to take notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I am not sure why Evernote all of a sudden send glitches throughout the Android app like never before. otherwise it's a good app for what it offers and makes claims to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love love love evernote. I love the flexibility it gives me to create notes that I will want to consult over time. And it's so powerful, with many options for including media."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Back button no longer works. It exits the app rather than takes you back to all your notes. Notes only load 1/2 the time. Must exit the app and try again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great tool to record all the facts that complicate our lives. I wish it was easier to integrate callups/ reminders with our Google calendar."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not sure why the security feature is removed in latest update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sluggish fat dinosaur. It USED to be fast. Probably 2 years ago. WHO WANTS TO WAIT 3 TO 4 SECONDS ON A SNAPDRAGON 835 PHONE FOR A SLUGGISH NOTE APP TO FIRE UP? First tap, no response. Blank note. Move to main screen, tap note, then note opens. This is to be carried out for every single note. If you want to make this paid software, why do you deliberately cripple it for those who use it without any need for premium features? Freeware is now crippled-ware, with multiple pay to upgrade nags weekly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App constantly crashing and pricing is way to high to justify the value"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Earlier I love this. But nowaday it stopped working and keep saying ""Client Debug Mode"". So I cannot do anything with this apps. And last night I got an email that someone accessing my account. But in apps there is no loging history from another devices. It seems, this apps unsecure too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's crashing non-stop with the white screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to love this app, but app keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It closes the app every time I press the back button, it also won't let me take the tour to see how to take notes properly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🛟 life saver"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Every new update makes the app slightly worse than previous version..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Someone tried to overtake my acc from Pakistan and Vietnam. And now evernote not user friendly anymore. Too many bug. Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It needs to be rebranded as ""Nevernote"" After years of using it as my go-to resource for taking notes and notating important information, Evernote has completely stopped working. When I click to open the application on my Samsung Note I get a flicker of hope as it seems to be loading, but then everything completely shuts down. It is as if nothing ever happened. Reaching out to support has been a waste. I keep waiting for something to change, but a month later the app is still useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keep crashing to debug mode since August 16, 2023. Hope they fix it soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote no longer works after I was forced to update. So, I'll be looking for a new notes app. Evernote was once a perfect notes app. But, it's now become another slow, bloated, unreliable, annoying app that's forgotten that we purchased it in the first place, which was because it *was* a perfect note-taking app. I've been a paying user since 2011 I think. So, it's a sad divorce."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Works slower and slower and there are more and more bothersome ads"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's my life book. But it's now very slow before it opens and after it's opens, it very slow to save. And even some notes are not saved. It's very DISAPPOINTING, please rectify. I'm using free version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app since a long time, but now this has started crashing in 30 seconds of use. Needs an immidiate fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good, simple note taking app. In recent months the free version has been almost sabotaged to encourage paying too much for a premium version. Ads to upgrade constantly, notes deleting words after saving, can't open a note on the first try (have to back out and go back in). I have synced, restarted device, Uninstalled and reinstalled app, but it is just the new normal. looking elsewhere for note apps. used to be perfect for taking a quick, reliable note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After a long period, when I did not use the app and changed the smartphone, the app started to crush (I can provide the screenshot with some debug info that appears on the screen of my new phone). Would you, please, advice, how to save my notes from the app? Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has Been Getting Worse for Years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Not secured, password protect has been removed. I used to be able to lock the app with password or biometric but now i can't, please bring back that option. It's not safe if anyone with my device can access my notes, I have sensitive and personal informations in there, i might have to look for an alternative if the lock option isn't restored. Every other thing works just fine for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"just crashes everytime"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Helo we are very sorry bro"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was the best note app, i have been using for 10 years but now it is just unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$17 or $22 a month to for notes. pffft, you'd want to do more than that for the price. I imagine a CEO wanting a new house with these prices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Making short notes is easy as possible to start 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the upgrade, the Passcode option is not working. When open evernote It goes directly to the home screen without any Passcode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worked great fur years. Now completely non functional. Crashes immediately upon opening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Reminders still don't work in Android"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last key presses ignored, misses last entry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"8/19/2023 Update: This app has become incredibly buggy, worst update yet Update: Over the last few updates, they seem to have stabilised the app and its working well now. Original: Most of the time it works well, but things that don't are huge. I'd just like to have a stable app. They changed something a few months ago, and now all my notes take a long time to go into edit mode, and the bigger they are, the longer it takes. Things work well then don't work quite often. They need to test better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"On android this app is buggy as heck, and even the feedback option doesn't work so I can't tell the developers to fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps going into client debug mode upon opening a note. Currently unusable on my s23 ultra."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app on my old phone. Since I've updated phones and installed the newer version I have issues opening attachments. When adding notes from camscanner (a separate app), I don't have the option to add tags or notebooks like I used to. I'm going to have to find a new document/notes app to use because I need to be able to access my info at work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"app entering to ""client debug mode"" and keep crashing. this issue also reported by other android users, they still couldn't find solution... had to move all notes to another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Suddenly it's so buggy that it's become unusable. I can't find the notes I've made without it crashing. So frustrating as I've been using it to store recipes for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Was great now debug mode. Not sure what happened after a certain update. The phone auto turns to white screen says debug mode. Removed app installed it same thing what is going on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It is crashing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently (probably after last update) this app has stopped saving my last change in current note. Quite irritating, please fix it otherwise I may need to consider other options on the market."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great App....highly recommend!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Vary bad experience, after some time it force you for to take premium plans, that is vary irritating. I had made many valuable notes on this platform but couldn't use it, anytime i click on it, the premium options is on the way and more irritating that you have to log out from your account to re-use it. Very bad 😞😞😞😞😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"High price"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A ""client debug"" screen comes up every few seconds, making the app impossible to use. Major bug that needs to be fixed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good. Now it only saves parts of my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Changing my review from 5 stars to 1 until passcodes return to the app. This is a critical feature for those of us who want to secure our private notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Extremely buggy. Never ending problems."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has become unusable. You open the app and it glitches not allowing you to look at your content. I try to screenshot everything before the app crashes so I can move it elsewhere. I am going to try and log in through the browser and see if I can save my stuff that way. But you still receive their trusty advertising for their paid versions! One way or another I'm done with evernote period."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love Evernote. use it for work and having all my info to hand. Am more organised and less stressed as a result. Superb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It is nice software but I'm not sure if ""premium"" is worth what they are charging. Keeps crashing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm a paid subscriber for more than 10 years. I recently paid for the latest subscription increase. My phone is completely updated and current. Evernote crashes and closes, every time I open it, as others have reported. If these issues are not fixed, I will take this up with Google Play... the US Federal Trade Commission... my state attorney general... the Better Business Bureau, and others. Fix this—or I promise, I will make so much noise, you will deeply regret ever accepting my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App lock option gone.. Not showing. Pl check.. Even app now not working properly.. Not able to load note with pictures"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was really good years ago. now, every time I open it, I want an alternative. It's buggy and really slow. Painful experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've took a break from the app, and now it's unusable. The moment I open the app for longer than a minute, a sudden debug white screen appears that you cannot exit out of (ut sends you right back to your homescreen), perhaps of another forced subscription offer that's severely overpriced for a notes app. Utterly disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I keep getting a ""client debug"" message"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app.i had it since 2014 now the app is awful unless you pay for it ,there are other apps that sync better and do the same features ,be better off with good notes ,one note or Google. The app is slow and I'm just not a fan years later"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Became unusable after the last update. Fails on my phone and my Chromebook. Takes forever to open (if it does) and cannot add a new note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless app that no longer works! A few seconds after opening the app it automatically goes to a debug screen and there's no way to get out of it unless you close the app and restart. And then the cycle starts again. Seriously, come on with this junk! 🤔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"There are a lot of problems with links to the note, which are not work, with the attachments, which are often lost. We can't use this application as we used it before. The tech support doesn't work, or it's very difficult to contact with them. I don't understand how to do it.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"USELESS unless you pay for premium & premium is NOT WORTH IT! Not only is there a paywall behind almost every worthy feature the app constantly lags and does not function properly, why would I pay an outrageous $15+ PER MONTH for something that doesn't even work all the time? You're better off using a FREE to do list app and a separate note app if necessary, I downloaded this and will be deleting it after less than 30 minutes of use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's performance has been decreasing ever since I started using it. There's no way to contact support. I can't log in to change password because it won't send me the security code despite waiting for hours. So there's nothing I can do but change apps for keeping notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Passcode function to unlock app disappeared, please help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote premium for 9 years. Due to the recent enormous price hike I chose not to renew my annual subscription and go back to free. Even after removing all other devices but one, the app still crashes upon opening and no amount of forcing closed/cache clearing/uninstalling is working to fix it. So all my notes - many containing info that helps me manage my day to day life as a disabled person - are inaccessible. Seems they're trying to force us back to paying."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"no longer brilliant but utterly useless and unusable client debug mode !! what is that I've been using this app since 2012 and have all my passwords stored there which I can't now access .How can I fix this .ADMIN"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too laggy and choppy! I've got a Pixel 4A 5G phone with a Snapdragon GPU — but it takes me 3 laggy seconds to create a new note. That is ridiculous. Another drawback — you made the interface too complicated. The current notes page should be THE MAIN screen, not a snap part of it I need to find every time. You know, sometimes less is better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the heck is wrong with this app. I have information on here set is essential that I get and now I can't."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"NEW REVIEW: Totally lost for words. This app use to be great! It never had issues . it was seamless, now it freezes and takes what looks like screenshots of each item I click on..which seems shady! ill will be migrating off evernote, sadly bc I use to tell everyone about it. OLD REVIEW:Evernote is my absolute favorite app really! It is actually the only app the I consistently recommend to friend, family, people I pass by and business relations, and so on! Well done Evernote, well done!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Crashing all the time now since the last update. Has been working great for years until now. It work for a few moments then goes into debug mode..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Close to 10 years of using the app and all the good things about it are now gone. Quite unfortunate as it was the perfect app for notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It just hangs and shows a code page every time I open it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a loyal subscriber for years, because I find the web-clipper & email address note-dropping SUPER convenient. However, when the app repeatedly crashes into a white debug screen making it unusable (conveniently when my subscription expired) — it's time to move on. I hope they recover and don't just abandon development of what once Was a great app. (Maybe I'll return if they do.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is crashing very frequently. Bad service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not only did they try to almost double their paid subscription, but now the app no longer works at all. The company also left USA. Better find a new notes app, this company is going under soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So I've been getting 20, 30, 40 times a code being sent to me phone threw text. Obviously someone is hell bent on breaking into my account. Evernote, don't u think THIS IS A SCAM, SOMEONES TRYING 2 BREAK INTO MY ACCOUNT!!! Not one message from U. Thank God, I have 2 points of security & u r taking that away now? Why would u do that? For that reason I have printed out all my necessary files. And I'm deleting everything else. BYE BYE EVERNOTE!!! I'M SURE U WILL LOSS A LOT MORE CLIENTS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The notes taken from my phone app were not saved even though I saved them multiple times! This happened twice already when I took a lot of notes from classes. I will not take notes from this app on my phone again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The 10.52.2 update from July 25th is not solving the white screen bug (related to passcodes). Today, August 16th (so 22 days later) the team didn't roll out a new update to unblock us. It's okay to have some issues from time to time. But 22 days later and paying customers struggling with their businesses IS NOT an acceptable business behavior. I am moving to another provider soon"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It does not work.When I click on Log in button. it does not work and take a log time but it does not open or log in.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years and love it but recently the screen goes white after pass code entry. I'm so disappointed. I hope I haven't lossed everything. Edit: Now the app keeps crashing & I can't access very important information 😔. I've unistalled & reinstalled to no avail."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bruh, why did you broke something that used to be so good?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sharing notes is painful. Received an email for a new shared note but it doesn't appear in the app. The email link just takes you to the app store, after signing in on the website, and then opening the app does nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely worst app Can't annotate pdf properly, Not easy to use tools like highlight option, Very slow app, not able to import most of documents in different formats, can't get pdf in printout format, not able to highlight pdf properly this apps sucks I paid for a professional use, Money Wasted It just famous for no reason, onenote is way better than this one"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I enjoyed premium version for an year and decided to take a break before getting back to the premium version again. And since the day I downgraded, my app isn't even openning. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, and its not helping. Could anyone suggest what to do now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After latest update version 10.52.2 , fingerprint authentication at app start seems Removed, security should be be there"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good but fine bugs in this app , increase the stability. Please improve app stability & fix major & minor bugs ."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, was using for years. Now it doesn't save vital info. At 1st I thought it was my error and not saving it. Nope. Went in and saved several times. It shows up as saved at that moment. Check back knew min later & it's not saved again. Bummer. Had to Uninstall & move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a paid member for many years but now I don't want to pay the new price the app kepps crashng and I am unable t9 access my notes. Terrible service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"spends more time telling me to upgrade than being useful at all why would i want to upgrade if i haven't seen a single useful feature?! also the ""share feedback"" button in the menu is broken... an organization app that prioritizes form over function, super backwards for anyone who cares about organization"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Major let down after using this app literally for a decade😩 I can no longer review my notes! it allows me to see them for a short moment and then loads a debug screen. I'm a writer, and I make music. most of my content is saved on this platform. I was literally in the middle of recording when this started happening. Please fix the issues!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It suddenly started to take too long to load notes, not mention to add a new note. I've tested in different devices with better performance, it has the same lag issue. It's so weird because I use this app for years and I never experienced something so slow like it's been now. Not sure what's happening. And yes I do have the latest updated version and I also pay for a subscription, which make me more frustrated to see that lack of performance in Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware before getting this app! I had it and loved it for years until yesterday. I kept very private info in it. On my own I discovered something in it that looked like it had been hacked. Consulted with someone who agreed. Then discovered that the company itself was hacked last week and they failed to notify paying customers. Unethical and caused me untold problems trying to relocate my info from there in mad scramble yesterday."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"15.08.2023 - It used to be amazing... New Android phone and Client Debug Mode keeps showing up and crashing the app. I am unable to use Evernote and see my notes. Fix it urgently, please."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Crashes to debug mode constantly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I upgraded to the paid version to use this more day-to-day, ie. more than just a random note here and there. However, there's serious sync issues. Occasionally, when I return to a note or task I recently wrote it won't have saved most of it! Or if I open Evernote on my phone shortly after using it on my computer, then it will sync my phone to the computer and delete everything that I just did on my computer. It is terrible and unacceptable that I can't ever rely on Evernote to save my notes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was able to use biometrics to open the app for security, but now the app just opens without biometrics."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote no longer password protects the app. Anyone can open it on your android device. This is no longer a safe app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it just cant save ,I did press the tick icon on the top left ,it just cant save,original content remains as it was."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"very buggy and keeps opening some kind of information page that should likely be running in the background."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The app is very simple and not difficult to operate but there are way too many glitches and crashes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Removed password lock feature. All support articles show it is available, but it is nowhere to be found in settings. I have been using for 10 years, and the biggest reason is the security. Disappointed. Also, there's an ad every time I open the app, and many times when I navigate between notes. Update: I received a customer satisfaction survey, but no response from customer service. Needless to say, that didn't go well. Fast forward 2 weeks, and now I cannot save any edits."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Works great but frequent popup advertising a ""one time"" discount on the paid feature is very irksome. I get that you need to meet the bottom line, but could this at least be limited? I get this ad claiming it's a rare offer multiple times a day..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A used to be great app that now extorts money from old users. Officially dumped.You can keep my family recipes. You are mud to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"8-14-23 UPDATE: not working again. Was working relatively smoothly for a few months. Now I can't start a new note on my galaxy s20fe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very poorly built app. As soon as I open the app, it redirects me to client debug screen and stop I can't use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"decent app, but the constant reminders that you could be using the full paid version, with two clicks per reminder needed, make it really ugly. I'm going to transfer my data elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"app keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously free app cluttered up my notes home page with unwanted options. Won't let undo their SABATOGE unless I buy their $77 membership."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Passcodes are disabled supposedly temporarily, which has made this app obsolete for me. Can't wait and must move all my info to a different app asap. Used it for years but all good things must come to an end, sadly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the free version for years but the pop ups advertising the premium version are now so frequent that it's making the app unusable, so I'm now looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good. Now its unusable, sometimes it does not save notes and stay in loop trying to open them, the most basic that you expect from a notes app. Going to transfer everything I can to Onenote or other app that works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible experience with the new versions Literally it doesn't open when it is very urgently required even at the high speed of internet it keeps processing the sheets. I am going to uninstall it forever and will find any other App"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app won't even open any more because of a bug. Unacceptable!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Frequent developer-side popups and the inability to save notes make this app fully unusable. Don't use this app for notetaking in its current state."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote for years, but now it's unusable. Shows a debug screen whenever I try to view or edit a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I so hate this app and i used this for 3 month for most hatefull experience ever. Your notes not encrypted and every evernote worker can read them (search wiki about this). Many notes not saved and it is so randomly. God, how i hate this.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Upon opening, takes me to a debug screen and doesn't let me escape. The app has become useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using this app for over 5 years. It used to be great. But now the app keeps losing my edits. This is extremely frustrating as I write notes to help me remember stuff. Undo/redo doesn't work and is embarrassingly poorly implemented. And now the app has the audacity to ask me for a subscription a few times per day. I am sick of dismissing that prompt. It's just a note-taking app, how hard can it be to get the basic functionalities working? Maybe it's time for me to look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"No text"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love it. Now if I open the app and view a note and then try to view another note it wont open. I can't open another note until I completely close it out and open it again. It also is not saving the information I input. When I go back to the note the information is missing. I have tried completely Uninstalling the app and reinstalling it multiple times and it continues to happen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good. I had it for years without any difficulty. Now, the app is slow with a terrible UI. Navigation is confusing and my phone's back button does not work with this app, it simply acts as a home button. The app forces you to use the in app back arrow which is confusing as every other app allows the phone's back button to return to the previous screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Has become way too bloated, finally decided to uninstall. Used this for at least 9 years because it was a simple note taking app that synced with an online webpage. But then they added the homepage as an extra click, and lately its been CONSTANT popups to upgrade which adds another click, and syncing has been real slow. I want to open something and immediately jot a note, not go through 3 steps to get to what I need that may not even load. Switched to Google Keep Notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The downward trajectory of Evernote is obvious now. I've used it for almost six years now, and every time I turn around there's a better app or service, while EN continues to ""upgrade"" and remove functionality while finding new and more obtrusive ways to shove a 40% off coupon in your face. There are better services out there for business and personal use. Evernote is now just A Note App and doesn't really bring anything new to the table except limiting the number of devices you can use it on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Easy to capture and AI clean up support"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great, gets worse with every new release. Freezes constantly if you try to view more than one note in a single session. With the latest version it doesn't even save new notes when you click the checkbox! Luckily, I caught it on the third unsaved edit but this is the final straw, forced to find an alternative since I can't add anything new"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"received an email that someone tried to log in to my account in indonesia. i only have my phone, evernote doesn't work in mobile browsers, and i can't find anywhere to change my password on the app. chat support is unavailable, and they encourage you to submit an email ticket but don't supply an email. the help section and chatbot were entirely unhelpful. cannot use desktop site on mobile as i use the free version and it thinks it's a new device. this is a huge huge huge problem. please advise."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become increasingly unusable since I installed it. A few years ago it was a great app. I used it for client billing notes in one notebook and mileage notes in another. Now it regularly loses my entries and requires more screen entries to maybe record what it used to do so well. Was once great, now trying to figure out how to migrate to something that works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very slow app, not only because it is naturally very buggy and hard to navigate, but the experience is also hindered by very constant ads asking you to move to premium. And it honestly is not worth it, I've tolerated this for far too long when there are better alternatives like OneNote... But today for the millionth time a note I spent hours writing didn't save properly and it was blank when I urgently needed it, out of all the bugs this is the worst one and I'm never coming back after this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"An app this expensive should be a lot better than this. Crashes, slow, too much focus on (somewhat broken) features over functionality (let me read and write plain text notes with a minimal of fuss). Frustrating - would cancel my subscription if I didn't have so much of my data in the app already."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app shows 4.5 stars as of this review. It has been around a long time, but look at the more recent reviews. It was great, and then they got too greedy. Now the app is buggy. Switched to UpNote and never looked back. A suggestion would be to reduce the price for the personal tier. By a lot. It's a note app, not a productivity suite. A free account is utterly useless, and the cheapest paid tier costs more than Office365 or Adobe's Photographer's package. For a note app. Unbelievable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Last update is very bad. When I try to return using the phone keys or gestures, the application goes to the main screen. Therefore, the application cannot be used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I update a note and then close the note, it automatically deletes a few characters. So when I go back into the note, some of the information I need to remember just isn't there. This has defeated the purpose of it for me. I would like to keep Evernote, so I'm giving it some time to resolve."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Someone has been logging in to my Evernote. This app has become unsafe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Poor updates. Long loading time to access notes. Back button takes you out of the app instead of home page. Was perfectly fine before all these upgrades. Confused what the Evernote team are doing, making a smooth and simple app go downhill. Wil eventually switch to another app if no improvement is made."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I need to be able to take screenshots of my own notes, otherwise the app is of no use to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but recent re-installed it and it keeps crashing to ""Client Debug Mode"" and is completely unusable. What a shame"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"2023-08-13. Evernote is back, Better than ever before. They've resolved just about every issue and are continually improving. Finally got my entire team back on Evernote. It's helping us grow rapidly again. 2022-10-22. They are back. They've solved most of the major issues and we are back in action. They've rewarded my faith in them.. Some minor issues persists, but Evernote is now the go to app and works with most of our platforms"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it.. however the new update seems slow in my mobile phone~"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Where is passcode option in setting? How to lock this application with passcode ? Earlier it was visible in setting but now it's not showing. Why?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The client debug mode page keeps popping up, making the app useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I open the app, it goes to ""Client Debug screen""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is not working. After a few seconds it goes into Client Debug Mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow.Can't add a ""new"" note.Was excellent now hardly usable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app keep crashing on my phone, I am unable to use the app since yesterday. Plz rectify the issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"constantly crashing on my z flip 5, some page about client debug mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was a wonderful, useful, straightforward app. I got a new phone (pixel 7a) and now it crashes before opening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has become less and less usable and has finally gotten to the point where I need to migrate my library off of it. First it was having trouble saving my notes, and would create duplicates every update. Now it just straight up deletes whatever edits I make invisibly. You have one job, which is to record the words that I type so that I can read them later. App cannot do that reliably anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Whu no more Passcode option after last update?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started deleting my notes or portions of my notes and would duplicate pages on its own so stopped using evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Lovely note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The free version has worked well for years. Recently, the app thinks that I have multiple devices syncing which is bogus. I attempt to unsync and it tells me that it can't connect to the server. Have come to hate this app. Going to Google notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The PIN lock feature has been removed from the Android app. This makes Evernote unsecure."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to work well. Now can't share or download notes from other team members. Going to find another app to replace it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Far too often the app is now pushing me to subscribe to the paid for version. I've used the free version for so long and it's always been great. Now it just seems to have become a lot worse, sluggishly slow and pushing their premium version. I miss it back when it was a simple great app for making notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be a great and reliable app when they kept things simple. Now, starting the app up takes forever. You can't ever access a note on the first try because it crashes the app. The back button will exit you out of the app instead of out of the note and back to the main page. The only reason I've stuck with them this long is because I'm simply too lazy to transfer my data elsewhere. I would recommend elsewhere if you're looking for a dependable note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been a user of Evernote for a long time through iPhone. But I just switched to a Google pixel and the app keeps going to "" client debug mode"" I don't know what this is but it's frustrating. I would like a solution to fix it or something must be done with app for Google/Samsung phone users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I tried logging in on my new device, it unsuccessful up till now. It's very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"More commercial this app needs only money when I started using this app is good 👍 but now only 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑💰💰💰"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Password no longer asking .. its directly opening.. what a trash app it become"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The web app is fine other than the incessant popups for ""single time"" discounts on payed plans. But for me the mobile experience has been basically unusable. In no particular order: The app overrides rotation lock, so I simply can not use it when lying in bed or in the couch. There is no way to put notes into view only, so when scrolling through them the keyboard constantly pops up because it thinks I selected a word. And if you haven't opened the app yet that day, you WILL get an upgrade popup."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Always gives me a coding bug page. Very bad experience. Gonna stop using it after i unload all my data there. Don't feel safe to keep things here anymore. Feeling very bad with all these bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have a Galaxy A53 5G and when I add information to a new note, every character I type causes the page to jump upward."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What is happening to this app? Why can't I access past photos in my notes? They are being marked as corrupted! This is absolutely awful!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I heard that they were recently being acquired or something? If that's the case, this has been a disastrous acquisition so far. The app hasn't worked for a week straight. It is pretty ridiculous. *Update, it is 10 days later, and it's still not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So this just doesn't work anymore. Hopefully it gets removed from the Play Store all together. Why would you distribute a broken application? Genuinely curious"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update, completely unusable, have tried 3 devices but crashes and shows error page. I'm done with this, can't even access years of work saved on the app Very useful app, however when typing the keyboard disappears every 10 second. This pisses me off way tooo much Tried reinstalling, restarting device etc. But I can type this review easier than type in the notes for Evernote... Plus it just deleted and removed a whole page of notes... Fricck this shizzle"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I am having problems downloading Evernote because of a Purposeful CLOSED door. Look at this.

This shows door CLOSED. Issue Significant: Identity Theft & Replacement 🚪"

Please please lock the orientation of this app!! This is the only issue, otherwise i really really love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bloatware, I've had a smartphone since 2008/9 and I think I have used the old S Notes app a total of maybe 10 or 15 times, if that much.

Great app. Update 7/23/2023 - This app used to be the best but it's been going downhill recent year. This week, the whole app refused to open at all. Update 8/11/23 - App is working normally again after I removed some connected devices. Hope that helps other users with similar problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have never had a company or product I so much wanted to support, like, and continually have lowered my expectations for, still not be able to meet those low expecations and actively push me away. In theory Evernote is an amazing product and service. For what it claims to be, it is still the best. That is where my praise ends because it is all in theory. In reality, for what it is supposed to do, it is extremely poor in execution, unreliable, and the value is non-existent."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I do not like the update on the mobile app. I cannot find specific notes that I search for. When I use the app on my computer it functions correctly."

I literally downloaded it to try it on my phone, and within a few seconds of just having the home screen open, a debug screen appears that you can't back out of without closing the app! Even OneNote didn't have app-breaking bugs like this. It's very clear to me that absolutely no testing or QA goes into this, so I'm going to keep browsing for another alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why has the security feature of unlockinv with thumbprint been removed? Now no security to accessing notes. Will be looking for another app with more security"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The functionality is great and the interface is intuitive. However, these accomplishments are overshadowed by TERRIBLE security. I don't know how many times now I have had to change my password after getting texted a Verification Sign-In Code that I didn't request."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Too many adds and some notes take forever to load or won't load at all. May need to look for a new note application after having been a user for over a decade 😪"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you implement this ""two-step verification"" I may have to stop using Evernote permanently. I don't want Google knowing anymore than they already know about me! This is over-the-top and I will not be forced to use this. I don't want to use it! Many of us will be saying goodbye if you force this on us!!! It is not necessary :-( Other people and I have other options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing. Have uninstalled and reinstalled. Still no joy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not open on appb when another needs to send me ever note. Insists on paid subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to work fine now I got the white screen of death. Uninstalled several times reinstall and now it won't even open. What good is it! Time to find a new app! Of course it holds all my notes and I can't even access them. Terrible terrible terrible. Anybody have any ideas? Since we only have to try and help ourselves. Get this. Their answer is to get the latest version the latest version is the download. It is this version of causing the problems. Sounds like a big circle!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can not login, always waiting :("
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App crashes on startup every time. Unusable. I've been using this app for over a decade and am thoroughly disappointed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It use to work really well but now I keep losing what i edit to my note. It is unacceptable for note taking app because it is basic function of it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good, now goes to Client Debug shortly after starting app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long time subscriber and user. Recently received an email stating an increase in the pro version from $49.99 annual (discounted from $99.99) -> $159.99. No avenue other than moderated forums to express concern or complaint with this. It's a janky app that takes a while to load, occasionally as long as 1 X minute. I will be cancelling my subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"An excellent app. Very hard to find some features like fingerprint activation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's acting crazy, am not able to view my documents. What is the use of paying you guys for this useless app. Am stuck with my docs and cannot use them.. feeling very 👎"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a long time user of evernote but recently Client debug mode page is opening every time I open evernote which blocks us from navigating within the app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Debug Mode"" keeps popping up, while I'm trying to type, or 30 seconds into the app opening up. It just started happening on my new phone (Google Pixel 7 Pro), from an iPhone 11. I get that could be an issue, but there is no reason being explained. I'm just assuming. I have important data on this app, so can you PLEASE advise? Thank you!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"stop offering upgrades and asking me to review your product. im trying to use it and you are constantly disrupting me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changed my review from 5 stars to 1 star. THIS APP HAS BECOME TRASH. It keeps on opening the client debug mode. Didn't even allow me to copy my notes from this to some other App. DEVELOPER, ARE YOU LISTENING? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long-time user. Got a new phone, installed Evernote, and after being the app for 10 seconds all I see is a ""Client Debug Mode"" screen. Multiple re-installs, app still won't work! Evernote, many users have complained about this. When are you going to fix it?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Can't access any of my notes without getting a debug error code"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Despite trying alternatives, I always end up coming back to it. Just please improve the compatibility with foldable phones when 2 apps are sharing the screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It used to be a lot better and I would recommend it to everyone. Then they did their ""rebuild from the ground up"" thing and now the phone app is almost useless and very challenging. Example, when I have more than a certain number of notes in a notebook note, they all look like duplicates of the same note. The only way I can find notes now is by using the search tool. It's so frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"There should be full screen option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I give this app 5 stars but of recent don't know what's happening, my notes inputs just disappears. I'll write stuffs in my notes, and won't see it again. Please fix"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There is an error glitch while opening tags. Keeps going up and down. Please fix it! Urgent!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be good, now doesn't save everything so when you go back into the app some of the information is missing. Sort it guys"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App password lock not working???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote more than 5 years, my all notes in it. I was a huge fan of this service. However, recently, I even cannot open the app properly. Keep crashing with my Pixel 7. Still I need to access to my data, but it doesn't work with a browser version either. So I keep uninstalling and installing it. Somehow it works and I can see my notes. My point is, I think it is time to move on to other services sadly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even load older notes, don't see any more redeeming qualities to utilise this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Search tool has been wonky lately. It is not yielding any results - what's going on? Update 2021: Amazing, thank you for the update. ***UPDATE AUGUST 2023: App keeps crashing on my phone. I keep getting this screen that says ""Client Debug Mode"", or else a warning saying I need to upgrade to the paid service to keep using it on my device. It's disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I expect a note-taking app to launch quickly. Too many ads to upgrade. No option to export notes to PDF or text file."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Client debug mode issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Honestly the best thing about Evernote is clipping web pages. I have how it retain the original look. But making notes from the mobile App or PC app has been distateful. I have tried using the in app template but nothing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This app was working great until recently don't know what happened but now when you're typing a note then save it and then go back into it, only some of the text is there. Some of it doesn't save. Makes no sense. Fix asap because it's the only note app I use and love!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have loved this app for years. I keep all my notes and lists on it and I love that it backs up by itself. However, lately it's been really buggy. I'll add items to a list, go to another list, and when i come back, some of the words or lines are missing from the one I just updated. Also, the app has started CONSTANTLY asking if I'd like to upgrade. It's annoying enough to make me look for other apps. (And the price for the upgrade subscription is really high!)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app to take your notes on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a nice simple app. They fixed the edit problem they used to have, but now, this week, it will no longer sync or save edits on even one device. The home page is annoying. All it does is slow everything down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even use. Goes into debug mode so I can't type. Then the app crashes. Great fun...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Yes tugging, AF"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Disappointing that evernote has removed the password option for the free accounts. It looks like if you don't transition to a paid subscription, evernote will start taking away options that are available for the free subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Mostly fine despite some sync issues but the constant pop-ups asking me to pay for a subscription are so annoying I'm looking for an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Passcode password fingerprint all vanished with last update in mid July 2023. It's now 2nd week of Aug and no update released. Telling people to log out and type their password each time they log back in is unacceptable! Why didn't ever note email everybody admitting their error with their last app update and make suggestions so people knew their private notes were public if someone got a hold?! Unacceptable. Had been huge fan of Evernote since 2013 I'm about to remove everything to a locked opt"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is very outdated, choppy, and buggy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app. With recent updates, it constantly has bugs. Lags all the time. Performance has drastically reduced to poor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why the security features is removed?? I have put a password to the app and the password is no longer there, which is so wrong. Now I am trying to put security code to the app, I no longer find that feature."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"password protection option remove pls add"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had an Evernote premium subscription for over ten years, but I just chose not to renew because the price almost doubled from what it has always been and I don't use it enough to justify that price. The app used to be fantastic but has gradually gotten more and more slow and buggy. Starting the past few days I can no longer get into the app at all, it immediately crashes every time I try to open it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since 2015. Every recent update in the last 3 years this app and platform becomes less usable. The desktop app devours memory. The phone app constantly spams with upgrade offers ""that will never be offered again"" Now, today, the phone app white-screens every 30 seconds regardless if I'm editing a note, reading a note, or just looking at a list of notes. 100% broken app. Really disappointing to see one of my fav apps turn into a pile of hot garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Left premium after 14 years. Cost is too expensive and app has constant bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using evernote for years , likely more than a decade. All of a sudden unable to view notes more than 5 seconds without having errors or debugging data.. any updates to fix this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why did you have to make it so complex? Time waster"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote suddenly stopped working. This app is about as useful as a one legged man at an arse-kicking contest! Evernote SUCKS! I'd give it -10 stars if I could!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"it's really grate"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sucked can't see photos i put there"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great. Now just money scalpers. Blocks you from your own creative content trying to force you to upgrade to absurdly expensive plans when you already have a plan. Have horrible editing tools tool. I downloaded writer journal instead and its much more professional. Evernote better release my works to me (I am NOT upgrading again!), I'll say that!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to work very well. But now it keeps on client debug mode page even though I only use 1 device and my old phone had been factory reset. I can not access my own data that I had accumulated over the years. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app since as long as I can't recall, but with the recent updates on the app, it just stays in this so called client debug mode, like forever (a bug I can't even debug). It's really frustrating. I have to use the web version each time I need to access my files. You are beginning to make me ask these questions: Have I made a mistake? Can I trust you to really keep my notes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Latest changes are terrible but that's not what warrants the 1 star review. Literally every time I open the app it asks me to upgrade and start a free trial. $18/mo for a notes app, are you serious?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"crash on open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to work. Have used paid version for 15+ years. Am done with empty promises from support. No longer clips from the web. Search function is spotty. Really disappointing fall from grace for what had been stellar software."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"DO NOT PROVIDE PAYMENT INFO TO THIS APP. If you have, contact your financial institution and request a ""Stop payment"". It's the only way to prevent from being billed indefinitely by Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aug/2023 Reduced to 1 star since 0 is unavail as an option. Can no longer view most images and generally just sits there spinning. Some note updates fail and spin forever. Pretty much unusable. If you can't save your notes.. Each time before you open Evernote, you have to check Play Store for app updates. If you modify a note but have not updated the app, you'll be stuck. Check every time (Everupdate). I struggle often with the bug of stuff being erased accidentally when typing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it seems to have a lot of bugs at first launch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was fine until recently i dont know for sure which changelog version or update, now on opening it crashes immediately and doesnt open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"great app. the camera needs work, it's a bit fuzzy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seems to be garbage so far. It freezes on the tutorial."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update screen in blinking"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"i wish they'd catch up with Notion in terms of collaboration tools, database versatility, embedding and so on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I got a notice that my $41.99 subscription which would renew at $69.99/yr is actually jumping to $119.99 when my renewal comes up! It's hard to understand why the price is doubling. I'd like to keep the app but it's not integrated into my workflow enough to pay that much. I've still got til October to find the value in it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sarcasm incoming. SICK APP, THE BEST EVER. Honestly where did the passcode option go? I've never developed an app in my life and could do a better job than these jokes. 2 thumbs down."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years. Now I can't get past white screen after unlocking. I will be using different notes from now on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Passcode quit working all sudden. App went from great to unusable in a short period of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost all my image notes from the last 5 years. I'm out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The days of free users are over. Evernote used to be solid. Now they only let you have two devices synced. They hit you with a subscription offer every single time you open the app. (Who needs a notes app for $20 a month? Y'all are FOOLISH). I've pulled my work and moved over to Google for now. The app itself is buggy now, and doesn't function like a premium app. So long!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"EVERY YEAR IT'S GETTING WORSE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Several glitches, doesn't save edits and takes very long to load some notes on the mobile app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For the past few weeks, I'm getting consistent crashes or the debug screen. The app is up to date."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Dude, PLEASE stop sending me offers to upgrade to premium. They're daily now, and it's annoying to click skip and be presented with the same message of ""Are you sure? You won't get this option again"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used the app for years and loved it, now suddenly I'm unable to even open the home screen to the app for more than 3 seconds"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the app for a decade. But recently it has become almost unusable. It is very slow, glitchy, and just deleted a note that I had finished typing, which had taken a lot of effort. There's another glitch where the app automatically rotates the screen when tilted, despite the system settings being set to portrait. It's a shame to see the fall in quality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why can't I lock my notes anymore?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i started using evernote a long time ago and i literally dread it now. constant popups cant load my notes offline. stuggles to load when im connected to wifi. i will be swapping to an offline notes app that doesnt harass me for money every month to look at my text files."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Someone trying login to my account more than one time. When I was trying to change password or deleted my account permanently, then force me to buy a premium apps, which I dont want that and never using again. 👎👎👎 this apps sucks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I think Evernote is the best note taking app that I have ever used. However, it has a serious drawback that's been happening quite frequently, which is loss of some parts of the notes taken on the phone. I tried several times to save, wait, not shut the app, etc. But all has failed. I lost an important note once, almost entirely, all that was left was the title! It's risky especially when you have a checklist and you count on it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🫶🏻💚"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love it. My whole family 7sesnit for various reasons"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good before passcode removed. Now totally useless as it can't be locked."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A little irritated. Unable to enter passcode to protect anyone opening Everynote. Passcode does not appear in settings. How do I fix this?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has been good, except that recently, it has been bugging out, and a white screen pops up. It's unfortunate because I use this app to take important notes as it pertains to my studies. Now, I can reach them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Old phone it is working normal but it is not working correctly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently had the android white screen when opening the app. Uninstalled and reinstalled which cleared that however no longer able to lock the app with pass code or fingerprint"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Eliminaron la opción del passcode, ya no brinda seguridad en las notas. Cada vez esta peor."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am still frustrated with the handwriting feature. It didn't work. I dint even see the option to handwrite as it says in the help section. I have downgraded my review after using this app for years. I used to use this app for all my note taking. Now, it doesn't provide an option for handwriting notes. It only has sketching which is limited to a short canvas, not a scrolling canvas like the previous feature. If I didn't have years of important notes on here I would uninstall it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was always a five star app for me but I have observed that I can't find any option to password protect my app anymore which is a huge safety hazard. Did you guys remove the option to password protect the app? Been using this app since 2015 and now its just disappointing. Just let me know how can I password protect the app and its data and I think then this app would deserve 4.5 star (-0.5 for all the bugs and not loading multiple times)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps going into this client debug error page no matter what I do which is ridiculous. Tried uninstalling but didn't work. Why Evernote?! You were so good. This sucks because I have tons of notes from more than 10 years and I can't continue using this app. Lousy!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Crashing evertime I open it in my new handset"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This is a very good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app for years. The developers actively try to make it worse over time. It's hard to leave / export your notes, which is the only reason I still have it. Needs an update literally every time you use the app. Often won't download the images within a note. The. Literal. Worst. Get something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable. I have been using this app since 2013 so sad having to switch. I think Evernote is booting people who don't buy the paid version. Goes to ""client debug mode"" after 5 seconds. Have re-installed the app which did not help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Whenever I reject the premium trial offer, it automatically turns on ""auto-rotate"", very annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When you copy a chunk of text, the moment you hit 'copy', the text disappears. Then, you are unable to paste it. And when you go look at your clipboard, it's not copied there, either. Try to back out and discard your changes? Nope, it saves it and your work is gone. I emailed support days ago, but they have no interest in returning my email. If you value your work being saved and not lost, use another app. Update 1 year later...this is still happening & now it's not even saving new notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The white screen is shown when I try to use the application. I have a lot of important things I really need it. Please fix the issue ASAP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new upgrade has cost me some pain. The app crashed, I uninstalled, and reinstalled but my recent notes are wiped out. I will appreciate it, and increase the stars if restored."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App no longer works"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has become joke. On phone it is displaying some client code white screen error. On PC and web it is horribly slow. Slow, heavy, overpriced and buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"keeps crashing on a brand new pixel 7"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good use..thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote stopped working for Android phone and tablet since the July 2023 update. It lost its password log on and keeps crashing. Fix it please Evernote. I used to love you because of your ability to attach files but I am now switching to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"White screen issue. Hope youbguys fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Out of sudden passcode access has disappeared, my doc is not protected at all"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using Evernote for years now. What I liked the most is that I'm able to secure it with a password or a fingerprint login, but now, with the recent update, there's no option for that anymore. Can you bring that feature back, please? It is imperative to be able to place some sort of security on the app besides your encryption."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"They should change their logo to a snail and rename the app Everslow after the recent update. I rarely write reviews. I've tried many note taking apps and this blows me away by far. It is very good & has made my life very productive. I actually cannot possibly go without this in my life now as it helps me keep on track. 5 stars without hesitation. Update Improved a bit. I do like the new Evernote although the legacy is a wee bit faster. I think once the AI evolves it'll be 5 stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I decided not to renew my subscription because there is no Arabic support. RTL support is bad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been an Evernote user for years, but now the app is glitchy and repeatedly crashes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stuck in Client Debug mode like everyone else which makes the app unusable. I understand that accidents happen but this has taken far too long to resolve. Edit: 10 days since I posted this. No update available. Assume they're rebuilding their entire app from the ground up to fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I had set a password lock on app But from last week it's automatically unlocked & now i m not able to set a password for this app b'coz i can't find the password option"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"there are many glitches that make it difficult to find information of stored. just now, I opened the app, and wasn't even asked for my passcode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for at least 10 years with literally my whole life, recipes and passwords saved. The latest update has caused it to crash and I am unable to access any data at all. Do not purchase until this is fixed. Disappointed and now trying to get all the important information to another more trustworthy app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just stupid app, cant use without buying"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"before the latest update I got the white screen of death I updated and ever since it crashes the moment I open, haven't been able to access my notes since the latets update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't figure out how to get around client debug mode. 100 percent useless app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Stop. Asking. Me. To. UPGRADE. How many times do I have to hit ""no"" to make it stop?! And when I tapped the button to share feedback within the app, nothing happens. If I want to upgrade, I will do it on my own. I'm about to completely uninstall this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Routinely fails to save changes to notes, making it essentially useless. The fundamental feature of this app—to save notes—is unreliable. I have used it for a decade and am suddenly considering other options for the first time ever."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I set up a pass code and put my private info in this app and the update took the pass code off unexpectedly exposing my private information. Not acceptable at all. I have been suggesting this app to my customers and I won't anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What in the living hell did you guys do to this app? It's virtually unusable. Looks like you intentionally made it horrible to try to force people to pay for it. After so many years of using this app I'm looking for a new one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been a user since 2015 and it is just getting worse and worse. More things are becoming unavailable to use due to premium membership taking them, unable to open some of my older notes, and it constantly asks you if you want to upgrade. It's getting exhausting. I miss it being a nice free -functioning- note app. One of the best to now being next to unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not buy this service if you want company that provides support they have none, no chat, no phone, horrible email, I feel horribly ripped off and as long time customer, you Evernote should be ashamed, but why do you care, as long as, customer keeps paying, ...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been a user since 2012 for Personal (longer on free) and just cancelled 2 yrs ago Annual price $41, last yr $60 something.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently when I press the android back button while editing a note the app exits instead of going back to list of notes. I have tried deleting app storage and reinstalling the app so I think it is by design."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't even use it because a client debug mode keeps popping up. I came to the app page to see if an update was available and there was, but that didn't fix the issue. Apparently this issue has been ongoing for weeks now, and no one is getting any support."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote is still stuck in the past, constant crashing. glitchy UI, bugs galore. I needed a cross platform note app so I checked the OG app before looking for others. Definitely NOT trusting this creeky app with any important notes..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"FIX THIS ASAP! The app crashes frequently after the recent update. I hope this gets fixed soon. Also, it's annoying to see the premium ads every time I open the app. I discontinued my premium subscription because it has become too expensive."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You should really stop with all your attempts to make us buy additional features with your ads that look like third world little tricks, the more you do that the more I will switch to another note app the second I find a better one... stop with your ""it's the last time you get this offer"" and then the next day we get it again, how poor does it make you look ...? 🤣"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My S8A tablet and g6 phone was hacked in Canada. I immediately got into Evernote and took evernote off the tablet and my g6 cell phone.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for more than ten years. The note taking and sync feature is great. However, I recently checked in on my security settings and Access History, where I was met with over 30 entries where my account was accessed all over the world, including South Korea, Bangladesh, etc, over several months. I received no email or alert for this security breach until this morning. I also can't user Evernote anymore as it continually opens a debug mode and my screen gets covered in code."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used this app since it was either fully free or at least minimally intrusive ""premium features."" I loved it at first. I wrote lots of important things. Now I'm moving them away from Evernote because every day it bombards you with ""last chance to get money off premium"" messages and the app has steadily become jankier and jankier. It used to work smoothly and now it lags and hangs. It's a joke."

WARNING!!!!!!!! DONT BECOME A VICTIM OF EVERNOTE!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was so good for so long now its no unresponsive and takes forever to load a simple note. Moving to keep notes. Uninstalled"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't open my app Also very slow When i press back key on my phone it exits the whole app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm using a Pixelbook. This app crashes on me all the time. I can't even delete a notebook because it will just crash. Not to mention I can't type anything in it properly. It seems to take up so much processing power that it will skip letters, making it impossible to type anything intelligible. I am disappointed at the performance and will probably cancel my membership to find something else that works properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for a decade or so. But, for goodness sakes, fix the can't-draw-on-Samsung-tablet bug. Samsung Note is slowly taking over my patronage. You have to care a little, right?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update: I use Evernote all day long to manage family and work. The app is always the most challenging. It is slow to update when the amount of website updates are robust. It shuts down when you are doing multiple maneuvers between notes or tasks. I love the tool of a program like Evernote but wish the consistency was better."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't work anymore. Used to be great now it doesn't sync. Such a shame. Bye Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"$69 I have the free version! I wake up this morning to see a pending $69 charge where did this come from?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I downloaded Evernote and decided it was not for me so I ended my subscription . Then Evernote took money from my account after I canceled. What a scam .I do not recommend this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had a very nice experience with Evernote. But two weeks ago the app completely crashed and I couldn't use it for two days. And after it finally worked, I logged in without the use of my passoword, it somehow got disabled and now I cannot set it again. The whole point of Evernote for me was that the app was protected with a password. If the matter is not solved, I will stop using the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm disappointed about the fact that the app has no password protection. Anybody can access my sensitive information, as long as he's with my phone!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"decrease 1 star for new bogus update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"A great and easy-to-use notes app with many different features. However, at one point I couldn't access my notes because of a bug that was later resolved. I wish the only thing that would be affected while the app is down or I'm signed out is the syncing of new notes and that the old notes will still accessible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Amazing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was the best note app now it is really bad. Every time i use it, it says to pay money, and it does not save last edits on notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update HORRIBLE! CRASH! CRASH! CRASH!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"All of a sudden my pin code lock is gone and the setting for it is also missing?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's a decent app, one I've been using for years. But the company has become such a greedy, anti-consumer, money-grubbing entity that it's frustrating to use at a basic (free) level. What should be standard notetaking features and simple convenience options are locked behind a ridiculous minimum of $15/month! And now I can't even open the app! It crashes upon opening. Seeing what Evernote's become is devastating, as it's been with me for several years now, but it's time to move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Got an email saying potential unauthorized user from UAE trying to login. That's the good part, supposedly blocking a hacking attempt. Went online to login and check. Worth recognize new chrome browser. Won't work in any browser. Forced to use app. App keeps literally bugging out (client debug screen keeps showing and then kicking me out the app). Trying to find a way to export everything as right now I'm not trusting Evernote. Can't find a way, and this app constantly crashing isn't helping"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was not uploading. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it, now all my notes are missing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sad to see the way development has gone. This app crashes routinely, and the only fix it seems to be uninstalling and reinstalling. And that is a temporary fix. Even after reinstalling, it begins crashing after several uses. The new owners of Evernote need to know that this is the reason I stopped being a paying subscriber."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"What happened to the password settings or biometrics to access the app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Okay, I just did an update a few days ago, and it's awful!!! It is not working!! It blanks out all the time and I am having trouble pulling up my notes!! Fix this new version please!! Otherwise I enjoyed using the app before this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst after update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very buggy app on mobile - computer it is great. Not had any issues with the app on my laptop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"latest update seems to have bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now I remember why I stopped using the app. Can't even open the all without errors. So many important things were lost. Please shut down the app if you don't know how to run one it will help us much more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for several months,, and all of a sudden, I need to upgrade to use all the functional features. There was no notice period to upgrade to my knowledge. I think it is ridiculous to not alerting the user about the changes they were bringing. Now all my notes are stuck unaccessible. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened?! With every update the app got worse. We just wanted a simple notepad that syncs to the cloud. Now it takes forever to load, bloated with features no one asked for. 0 star."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why the password is longer available?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A constantly Irritating app with their messages marketing their premium plan. Plus it's not the simple note app it used to be. Find some other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote (free version) for 12 years. It's always worked really well and has been a fabulous and easy to use app. The most recent upgrade has rendered it completely unusable. It crashes constantly in 'client debug mode'. I can't access 12 years worth of notes. When it doesn't crash I get an error message saying I can't use the app across two devices (all I currently use) unless I upgrade. Is now dreadful and I'm trying to figure out the easiest way to remove my data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has stopped working on my s22 ultra, does not load notes. Glad I don't pay for added features, just basic as it's gone soooo bad.why Evernote don't seem to care? Not replied to any messages here or emails? 🤔"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not opening after latest update, Evernote team please fix it for Android mobile. Update-Started working after latest update but now I could not locate passcode feature in app, is it removed?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Organised better way but give problem like shutter hang just make it soft to use in any device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"it use to be very good until they decide to charge money.. adding all sorts of crab including adds, bugs, auto kickout of app etc.. from where i am from, charging money means adding added value stuff, making the current one even better.. but apperently the dev tried to force user to pay by making the free version crab.. hello u are not the only note apps around.. wake up!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love and appreciate this application. Unfortunately the passcode setup option has disappeared. Evernote staff if you could resolve this issue, this would be a five-star app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Functions well but every other time I open the app it asks if I want to go premium which you have to cancel, infuriating when you dip in and out as many times as I do. Also it seems to connect to the Internet every time you open and doesn't show your notes until its connected to their servers, which takes 10 seconds or so if you have a slow data connection. Why aren't all the notes cached to the device?? I just want a simple note app that doesn't relentlessly harass me. Too much to ask???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has truly become almost unusable - they have put almost everything that used to make it useful behind a paywall. Notes refuse to load, the app glitches out constantly, it rotates when auto-rotate is off on the phone, it constantly prompts for ""limited time offer"" which is beyond irritating when it used to work just fine without whatever they've decided is too good for the non-premium folks, refuses to update the last thing I typed in every note. Time to find a new notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app turned to absolute garbage"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The free version has been great. I have been using for years until recently, the last few weeks, whenever I saved the notes and went back in, part of my notes will be missing. This is so frustrating... hope they can fix this bug soon..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"all I keep getting is a Client Debug screen. it used to be great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing product I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So disappointing. Been a paid Evernote user for years as has my wife. Recent update crashes continually on android and is unusable even after reinstalls etc. Goes to the Client Debug Mode after seconds of being open. Am now googling Evernote alternatives"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I feel like the app relies entirely too heavily on internet connection. I've been using the app for about 8yr and I've had to take notes in Google keep to reliably save the notes on the device then I have to go in the office and transfer from Google keep to Evernote because if you lose service the note disappears, like you never made it.!frustrating! trying to figure out the problem meant many return visits to sites.The app itself is fantastic except for saving notes locally when mobile."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not as good as it use to be. Too often it would get errors while clipping from other apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It doesnt openup my old notes. Keeps showing strange logs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"White screen bug needs fixing. I can no longer use PIN security until a fix comes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeps crashing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"is this apps bugged??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the app since 2013. Used to be very reliable. It is now glitchy and unreliable. Notes that are edited are not saved, causing me to lose the edits for the notes. For a paid app, this is totally unacceptable. I'm a simple user and I just want my notes to be saved, but even this is a problem. And with other problems like taking a long time to open a note, notes out of sync etc, I feel like it's time to move out of Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hi I hope tech support sees this. 2 problems: 1) changes i made on mobile don't save (i have android). 2) the Contact Us feature does not work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to the app? It keeps glitching now when I got my new ph so I guess its time to go."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Took the pin number away. Very irresponsible - no warning."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ive been a paid subscriber for years now and I can't believe how bad the save function is well, not actually functioning. I had posted a complaint back in 2022 and eventually it seemed that things got better but then recently even when I click the checkmark in a note, the next time I open a note, what I edited does not get saved. This harkens back to microsoft word of the 90's except we're nearly 30 years later! At the very basic level evernote needs to make sure it's auto save function works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've enjoyed using Evernote since 2012 but it no longer works. Will not load just crashes and closes everytime I try and open it. Never had this issue ever before."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"stay clear from this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since the update of the app, you can't secure the app anymore via a password (code). I've tried everything and the chat bot was useless. Is this because of the new update or should it work? I love this app and want to keep using it, but want to protect my work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"لماذا أختفت كلمة السر و أصبح سهل فتحه لأي شخص . كيف أستعيد أمان المعلومات"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just keeps crashing!. Was perfect but now totally useless. Can't get to my notes at all and no way of contacting them to get help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is fast becoming unusable which is a shame as its worked well for years. Lagging notes, client debugging notices and kicking you out of the notes constantly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is basically unusable. Whenever I click on my notes it opens up a screen with the title ""Client Debug Mode"" with other links and what not. Developers kindly fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just 2 times login in a month, if we use by browsing and it got automatically logged out then we can't login more then 2 times. It should be removed... I think in 2 devices that is acceptable but only 2 time login and that's not fair."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"App has worked fine for years, until 07/30/2023, I recommend using Google Keep, another notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Doesn't save the notes properly. Half the notes missing when I open the note back up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great app, but now notes don't load properly and is soooo slowwww"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works good for what I do with it I updated to a pixal 5 and now you keep revoking my sync and won't work sees my phone as a pixal 6 then a 5 please fix.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Application crashes at start since the last update"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"good but I get hacked too easily. I got this app back in 2017, and I've honestly really liked it. it's functional and easy to use. recently though, I've been getting notif after notif, saying someone's connected. I keep changing my password, adding the 2 step authentication, etc but nothing works. I still get emails saying someone from across the world logged in. it's annoying and embarrassing. and I wish there was something I could do about it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to requiring an optional pass code? -- it cannot be fixed soon enough!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote no longer gives me the passcode option. How is my info supposed to be secure?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for years! And it was good till recently... I can't find the option to activate my passcode or fingerprint login.

WHAT HAPPENED? Syncing is horrandously poor since recent upgrade!!! Other setting tabs via mobile are also unaccessible, says my connection problem but fact is i am watching movies fine! And then next, the app just wont start... frustrating. WORST: App stopped loading, can't picked up last edit despite clicking ""save""."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this app for years, very useful & helpful, not just because I can save important notes, but I can keep it safe by putting passcode or finger print to lock/unlock it. But recently, the app just went blank. I can't even access my notes, & it gave me a hard time. Now, I can open it, but only for about 15 seconds, & it went on debug mode. So until the developer fixed this problem, I'm going to move my notes elsewhere, and don't hesitate to delete the app if it doesn't do it purpose."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a paying Evernote customer for years. Everything was fine until I installed this latest update. 17 of my notes lost all of their content. All that's left is the title. Any edits I try to make are not saved. Even when I try to make a new note, I'm not confident that my information will be there when I go back to the note. That totally defeats the purpose of this app. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Give me my fully functional app back!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Я в ужасе! Как можно было так ПЛОХО сделать приложение?! Ничего и никогда так медленно у меня не работало! 8 версия просто Флэш по сравнению со стоячим камнем. А этот кошмар как-то вылез на свет. А я-то думаю чем люди недовольны на форумах."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Still the problem is not solved......!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"why can't I password or fingerprint lock the free version. I also got the white screen and ended up having to delete and re-install. now I can't lock the app which makes it almost useless"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"HELP NEEDED. Hi, ever since I upgrade the app, the passcode feature is missing. Been trying to reach customer support but can't find the feature too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have a notification that I'm using an old version of the app on mobile but when I check Google play there's no update available. Perhaps it's not available for my phone?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app, but now it is unusable. When I have a thought, and want to record it, I don't want to wait while you update the app, I don't want to wait and watch the spinning wait icon. I WANT TO START TYPING, SPEAKING or TAKING a PICTURE - NOW - RIGHT NOW. Take care of your housekeeping at some other time. Fix the bugs and STOP THE FEATURE CREEP!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: it seriously is getting worse than ever! A bunch of notes that I had saved are no longer there. All that work for nothing! So frustrating. The older this app gets the more bugs it has. What happened? It used to be such a great app. After using it daily for 10 years I have to look for another app that actually works."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"client debug mode..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"For some reason, the app is malfunctioning. Keeps saying client debug mode and interrupts retrieval of stored notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Locked this with fingerprint access, it logs straight in without it after the 3rd or 4th time of accessing the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Goes to white screen and will not allow you to see notes, needs to be debugged."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I updated the application recently and the function to secure with password or fingerprint had gone. Please fix them as this are good functions. I paid yearly for this Evernote and believe this secure function should be available. Please action soon. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Worsening quality. It keeps lagging, losing parts of notes, selecting and copying is not seamless at all. Searching for words, phrases in the notes is painful. It is not user-friendly and over the years it just got worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great App. Greedy company. Long term subscriber and fan that has now cancelled my subscription. $159 is an insane jump from $89. Is this App really worth 40% more than a MS Office 365 subscription? Crazy. Who do you think you are? I think greed might be your downfall."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"This app has been brilliant for numerous projects, plans, notes that I've written over the years, but I recently chose to delete the app because it stopped saving at random times and was causing me to lose precious notes and amendments."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good app I don't use it enough to warrant the subscription services they continually push or I would give 5 stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scammed and wasted my months and months of efforts making notes. At first it offered free version where I could type and save certain amount of data (limited) per day. After I kept using it saving many of my important notes which I was preparing for my examination, at the last moment as my exam is drawing near I can't even view my notes that I have written down for revision. It asks me to pay a subscription fee to keep using the app. Please if somehow I can atleast view my notes help me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Im a Premium user, and as of a month ago, my evernote is not loading...im. getting a white screen. Fix asap as i have very important notes to retrieve. The app is not allowing me to sigh using an email address."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love the style of Evernote. it's easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been happy with the free version for years, on my 2 allowed devices. Now, I removed it from my tablet and tried to install it on my phone. As soon as I try to touch anything, it goes to some debug page and nothing else. I have tried to re-install it several times and the same thing happens. I guess I am done using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using app for years and all of the sudden various problems started occurring. Data disappears. White screen is the latest. Can't access my notes 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stupid, clumsy, slow and stuck in development for 10 years.... This is a half-dead dinosaur, not an app for daily use! Developers do not torture yourself, close the project or give it to those who have brains!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"User friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for many years but lately, the app has been very buggy and increasingly slow. The keyboard always pops up when I'm trying to use the checklist and blocks me from using it as checklist; editing text frequently glitches out and types over what's already there, eliminating parts of what has already been typed; and for a productivity app, they push so many ads to ""upgrade to pro"" that it straight up crashes a lot of the time - which is decidedly unproductive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Este aplicativo costumava ser bom, mas fui atualizar umas notas hoje e todas elas estão dando erro interno me obrigando a duplicar. Duplico e mesmo não resolve, não consigo editar e as cópias estão sumindo. Além disso está muito lento e travando."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since I change mobile devices, I have not been able to use this app. It opens but less than a minute it goes to a white page (client debug mode) which means all my important documents & info is unaccessable. Its very disappointing & frustrating. I've tried deleting the app 4-5x & re-loading but to no avail. Evernote will you please provide assistance"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It feels to heavy to be a ""note"" app. Eternity for loading and extremely slow!!! UI is great but what is the use of the same if it's not quick."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hitting the back button while in a note just takes me out of the app completing. And I'm being locked into debug mode somehow. I've never seen such a poorly made app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is getting worse by the day! I still have this app because of all the info I have put through the years. Just to open a note and write something is a mess and sometimes doesn't even safe what you wrote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changed my review, down to 1 star. Whatever update they implemented in July has caused the app to no longer work on my Android. The supposed fix release they put out is no help. Frustrating!!! I've used this product for almost 10 years and now I'm SOL, great that it still works on my PC but it's not like I take that every where I go...hence needing a phone app. 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So helpful for me to stay organised!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Is passcode lock going to be put back? It seems to have gone with this update. Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happened to the security settings? Pin, finger print unlock?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App is very slow on every system, bugs you with premium ads everyday, premium is not worth the investment, and now is not working on my Android after I tried to login on another device because of the "" two devices"" screen, even after I already logged off from another device. Developers seem to not listen to it's users complains for a long time. Simple things take a lot more tone than should take. App seem to be stuck in the past."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer be able to set up passcode on phone app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App keep pop up error and ask to buy premium at all time. In case you want to force people to buy the services please communicate clearly not just send errors to free user. In case it is unintentionally errors please help to fix"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very useful app/service. Highly refined and versatile. But it's got quirkiness at times. Developers seem to neglect fixing bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cannot enter app, just getting white screen. Very helpful when you need to get to your notes quickly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have about 5 seconds on the app before it diverts me to a debugging page."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"No more pin or fingerprint protection ???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I read today that Bending Spoons have taken over Evernote so I'm keen to check back and see the improvements made because at the moment it is completely unusable and yet again I'll be uninstalling it. Each time I click anywhere I get a screen which I can only assume is supposed to be for the developers and not a layman like myself. This has so much unrealised potential."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been on the app since 2015. Long story short used to be exactly what you expected from a notes app thats is shared across devices. Now, even accessing my notes takes minutes of loading time (if it loads at all), I am constantly bombarded by random ""last minute deals"" or ""switch to basic mode"" fear tactics. Guys just make a working app pls, put adds on the corners if you must, but this is pathetic, a true fall from grace."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The passcode feature is missing for Android v13"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not allowing me to stay in the site. This used to be a great app. And now the only way that they allow you to get in is to pay.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used Evernote for about 6 years now. I have never had a problem with the app until recently, around the time of the last update. I reached out to customer service after a few days of not being able to load the app. They gave me detailed instructions of what to try and it worked! They even followed up with an email to ask if their instructions fixed my problem. Thank you!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Switched phones and reinstalled, now password protection doesn't work. Or am I missing something?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great to none...moving to microsoft onenote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Good and simple for note and reminder, but sometimes I lose my note when it failed to sync, and it forces me to subscribe to get my previous note back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for years (free version) and have many valuable notes. However, I just recently got a new phone and had to re-download. The app is no longer usable- assuming because I'm not paying their new outrageous charge of $220/year. I'm sure my notes are great, but certainly not worth that much. Shame on you Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Was good now its only a white screen. What's going on? I tried restarting the app and blank."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to really love this app, but as time goes on there are more and more glitches. I'm also using a paid version, which makes it even more frustrating. It doesn't sync changes that I make on my computer. When using the app, I can't scroll all the way down my list of notes. In some of my notes, the text gets all jumbled - the app cut sections of text and randomly rearranged it into other places. I can't upload pictures anymore. Absolutely inefficient and aggravating. Looking for other options."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Changing my review. Been using Evernote for years, but it's gotten very glitchy of late. Screen would freeze (white) with biometrics. Tried to uninstall and reinstall. Now, there is no passcode/biometrics in settings for Evernote Personal app for Android."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was in love with Evernote since 10 years ago. But the last week it has given me a white screen after password. I had to uninstall and reinstall,then worked for 1 day. Next day the same happened.Very frustrated and need to move to another note app desperately. Update 25.07.23 - my Evernote was updated to v10.52.1 today.This version completely removed the security function which means my notes are NO LONGER SECURED.Instead of resolving the white screen problem they removed the security function."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"its really slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Glitching a lot lately, have to keep uninstalling and then reinstalling the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible app. Crashed like crazy. Popped up advertising asking you to buy the app premium account 🤣, when the app doesn't even work. Used to be a decent app..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New update removed passcode /biometric lock and now this option is not available in the setting. Poor coding, zero QC"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"22 DOLLARS A MONTH. Absolutely Not. Steer clear of this App. There is no Note Keeping App in the world worth 264 dollars a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Seriously considering leaving. The screen turns white whenever I unlock it and I have to uninstall over and over again to make it work properly. So frustrating. It used to be so effective even with free usage. Don't know what made it so unstable and useless like this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A decade-long power user, I swear by it. I'd give it 5 stars for most capabilities, but giving it a 3 because the app & web versions can be better optimized for power users. I recommend the paid version of this service. Customer service has been excellent under previous owners. Jury's out on the new owners. Hopefully it'll continue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was working fine for years. All of a sudden I've been experiencing issues. When I enter my passcode, Evernote is blank. No notes show up. I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app multiple times. Whenever I set up a passcode, the same problem happens. Evernote has been trying to get me to upgrade to a paid version for some time now, but I decline. I'll definitely refuse an upgrade with the app working like this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Developers please note that After latest update yesterday for some bug fixes, app doesn't work for me. While starting it shows a blank white screen after typing pass code. I have important notes in that.Solve this issue immediately."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I’ve been using this app since 2013. Ever since they decided to simultaneously sync notes across platforms, the Android app has fallen apart. It’s sluggish and buggy. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve lost note contents written minutes before, sometimes even abruptly cutting off mid-word, because the app failed to sync properly. Support will not be able to help you. The app is no longer reliable for its most basic function, and therefore I can no longer recommend it. Use something else"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"used to be a great free app, switched to Google keep even if it's way poorer ... at least it's free and available on all my devices ..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not for me. It's basically just templates to make lists. I don't understand why anyone would pay for such a thing. Some of the talk about this app tried to make it out as a writing tool - it is not. It's a list maker and nothing more. I can't imagine anyone paying that sort of money for something like this.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have loved this app for years. Over the past week, though, I have uninstalled and reinstalled it twice because when I open it, it just goes to a white screen and freezes. I hate the thought of finding another app but for whatever reason, it is unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This was a good app. I had used it for sometime. I am saddened that I lost all my information, but I guess an app does not work 100 percent all the time. I will still give it a 5 star rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This subscription service is predatory. I didn't select a paid subscription but due to a glitch,which this app often has, I was enrolled in an option that had zero changes from the free one except that it is expensive and you have to jump through hoops to cancel it. I've had this app for years but it's no better than any other notes app and after they took multiple payments out my account for a subscription I did not want, sign up for, or benefit from Im just going to switch. DON'T DOWNLOAD"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Unfortunately, my Motorola Moto 5G Stylus (2022) suddenly fails to display anything after entering the correct password. Is it the newest update? Just about everything else on my phone works normally. A restart of the app does nothing. A reboot of my phone does nothing either. I even tried it after closing all other nonessential apps. No change. Evernote still works great on my iPad. Yeah, I still give the app 5 Stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not working stuck at launch"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using Evernote for years & I like its simplistic layout & ease of use. However, it has recently become slow to load and has glitches.

Please fix this problem!"

I put in my passcode and all I get is a white screen. Nothing! I have had to uninstall and reinstall several times. It will work for a day, maybe, and still nothing. Having no luck and I do not have time to keep doing this. Sounds like I am not the only person having this issue. Either fix this glitch or you have lost another user."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've relied on this app since 2015. Only used the free version. It's suddenly not opening. Blank white screen. Uninstalled/reinstalled. Fixed momentarily, then blank white screen. Perhaps it's doing this because I don't want to upgrade? It asks me everytime I open the app. But now it's not working at all. Research tells me I'm not the only one. Ugh."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app until last week. Now the app won't open at all. It just stays white when and absolutely nothing can be done. I've lost all my notes, recipes, Etc"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Hello! I love this app - but it stopped working a few days ago in my Samsung galaxy note 20. Does this app need an update?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every day, at least once on each of 2 devices, the app nags me to upgrade to premium, despite my confirming I'm sure i don't want to. Why would i pay ANYTHING when the basic doesn't even work properly anymore? Been using Evernote since 2012, and it has been getting progressively inept. Now its not even saving the updates to my todo list, no matter how many times i make the change. And i can't swipe down anymore to sync. I type in 'steel wool', and it save only 'steel'. Can't even send feedback!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Blank white screen when trying to login. I thought it would be fixed but now its been several days and I am taking notes in ""Keep"". My experience with Evernote has been satisfactory and I would like to continue using it as my primary note taking app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not open anymore. Amazing how so-called updates ruin everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After years of using it, I'm moving to another app. Lately, the mobile version freezes and the simple note widget stopped working, showing error and it doesn't save the note. Also, if I use the computer's web version and try to use it later on my tablet, it never runs there so it's nearly impossible to stop synching in a device and I have to log from the web in my tablet and from there stop synching. The usage became bureaucratic and the faulty app is the last straw."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hang"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"EXPORT YOUR NOTEBOOKS AND ABANDON SHIP IMMEDIATELY! They squandered it, man. Been with Evernote for years; every year since their big refresh update, it's just gotten worse. Buggy, slow, inoperable, expensive. The latest nail in the coffin is opening the app to a white screen, an issue which apparently hasn't been patched for over 10 days. I am not willing to fund their failed school project anymore. I'm done! Check out UpNote: same important functionality, simpler design, better pricing."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Frozen, White and blank. I have been using the app across my mobile phones without any issue for the past 5 years. But now upon launching the app and inputing the passcode, the app just freezes, showing a white and blank page allowing nothing to be done. This issue happens across all my 3 devices so it's a general problem. Also, I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled it, works for a bit and reverts to same issue. The only workaround in getting into the app is by using the web version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently I've had to uninstall and reinstall the app to access my notes. The app just hangs after entering my pin. Such a dissapointment from an app I've been using for years."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used evernote for a very long time for work passwords, login in's etc. Then I couldn't access it one day, I had to uninstall and reinstall to access my notes. Once I did this I was given access to my data but only for 7 days then contuning access would come at a subscription cost. Very disappointing, it felt like my information was being held hostage, I have chosen to delete my data and remove the application. Well done evernote, outstandingly poor customer service."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes just won't load sometimes for no reason at all. The UI changes weren't needed but they're just slightly below okay at best. An option to export the notes to another app or maybe a word or word equivalent file would be nice for people who have been on the app for long and looking to migrate."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best note app there was! Now, it's laggy, buggy constantly creates duplicates of the same note all while constantly pushing the premium option. As many people have said, who is going to pay when the free version is SO BAD?! Definitely try another app. UPDATE JULY 2023: I didn't think it was possible for an app to be updated to get WORSE. Now, nothing will load unless I force stop, clear cache, clear data and ensure a PIN or thumbprint to unlock isn't on. SO BAD!!"

Over the last 2 weeks, red error screen whenever I try to clip something from the web. Now, I get a blank white screen upon log in. I use EN daily for work & am now crippled.

Cannot use browser either as Mobile version of site doesn't have SIGN IN - only SIGN UP for new users!And no email to support. Terrible!!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Greed destroyed Evernote! This used to be a useful programme good synch across devices and browser plug in. Free version was so good that I became a subscriber. Now it's totally annoying, the free subscription only allows 2 devices - and a web browser is classified as a separate device! You open Evernote website (you may want to change password for example) and your app gets crazy, prompting to pay at every click, if you dont, a piece of source code appears on your screen ... Totally unusable!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a user of this app for over 10 years. It has become very unstable on my android. Notes won't open, app stalls or freezes. I have uninstalled and re-installed to no avail. It makes the app only useful on desktop, which is untenable for me."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why do the developers of this app insist on incessantly tinkering with and ruining this app, especially after they repair one glitch and it's running just fine. They'll then release an update that comes with another handful of new glitches and bugs. It's awful. You're ruining a potentially great app for seemingly no reason. As of the most recent update my notes will not open at first, I have to exit the app and re-open it to get into a note, among others, like unsaved edits. Please STOP!"

It wouldn't allow me to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Edit*** goto phone app settings and clear all cache and data for this app them re-login should fix the white screen, worked for me They have recently Broken the app. LG V60 opens app, log in, sits on white screen forever and never gets to your list.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What happened? Been using for 10 yrs and no issues. Tried opening and would load. So I removed and reinstalled. Now I can't open any of my files that are pictures."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This apps will be not open in my device"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Decent place to keep notes until you want to share them. Seems all the functional parts of this app are part of their paid service, which I had for a while but it just wasn't good enough to justify the expense. So many features are lacking and in all the years I have used it, really hasn't had any good functionality updates except to take functionality away. What is really holding it back is a way to personalize the organization of notes, there isn't they just eventually sprawl everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"White blank screen! Can't get the app to open today at all. After unlocking, a white blank screen appears and goes nothing. Very frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app and use it to store a fair bit of information. However, when I wanted to check on something with the app, the screen goes white (after I input my password). This has happened multiple times, despite the fact of me restarting the app and even my phone. Please get to the root of this. I really enjoy this app and it's been a bit of a lifesaver for me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It WAS a decent free app that synced between my Samsung S23 phone and 10 year old computer. The recent update now will only give a white screen on my phone but works ok on the computer. It rendered itself totally useless to me. None of the forums address a fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app used to work well. Now it is broken. All I get is a white screen, followed by some jargon. I can't access my notes. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is such over priced junk. Just opens to a white screen and they dare to ask for 10 dollars a month. Junk!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Can't open the app since the last update. I get a white screen, and from other reviews, I'm not the only one. Never had this problem before, and I've used this app for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know what happened but this app is now unusable. I put my passcode in & just get a white screen that doesn't load to anything. I don't see any pending updates so hoping this will get fixed soon as I have important info in those notes I need to access."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad experience. Too much ad for upgrade. App no working on my tab. Some error screen appears 15s after opening the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Just got an update advising me that the app bugs were fixed, and now I can't access the app. When I try to log in, the screen just goes white."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great app, but it is currently not even loading when attempting to open, even after updating. I would uninstall then reinstall, yet I don't want to risk losing my data in it. Fix it please, thanks. Still has not been fixed (7/20/23)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"As of Today, July 20, 2023, I am getting a white screen on my Evernote App and do not know why? Please Fix..I am using a Samsung Galaxy Fold 3. I got an update 2 days ago. I do not know if this is the reason why?"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Having same problem noted by others. On my phone app the screen goes white when i log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app. Now it's worthless. Since the latest update, my password was disabled, allowing anyone to get into it. I set it back up, and now, a few days later, I put my password in, and I get a blank white screen. I can't not get to my information, which I desperately need 😡"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"New bug have to uninstall and reinstall app constantly fix this issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've since cancelled my subscription because I'm not using it as much as I'd like to; for starters, the app can't even load on my phone! Just a white screen after password input. It also takes a longer-than-usual time for my notes to load. I rely on Evernote for storing important notes I need to review frequently, so it's quite a bother I can neither use the app, nor the browser on my phone as it isn't supported."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Help! After many years of use, I now get a blank white screen!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Use to be great app. Yesterday when I logged in all I get is a white screen. After uninstalling and reinstalling the app it will not let me hit the continue button to login. I have years of notes in this app. It's totally unacceptable now"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App has been great for years, but now the screen is white and can no longer access my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"after updated, useless. When log in or use fingerprint, it show white screen. Unstall and reinstall again, all notes gone."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Essa última atualização o app abre e a tela fica toda branca sem nenhuma informação (Xiaomi 12 lite), corrijam logo que uso pra trabalhar"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great right until they do an update - used this on and off for a while, but seems a regular occurrence that they run an update then you can't access your info in the app anymore. Blank pages when you're trying to get info you need is very annoying. Likely to move all my stuff off here and go permanently elsewhere this time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why is this app so buggy ALL THE TIME?? Been using Evernote for over a decade but the android app is unreliable to the point of uselessness. Always something new wrong with it. It's slow and tetchy. The quicknotes widget isn't saving notes anymore (I only found out recently, after using it loads so lost a bunch of notes). Now can't even open the app, just a white screen. I don't understand how it can be so consistently unreliable? Are all the staff just iPhone users? ""Remember everything"" - Ha."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working. Couldn't access my notes- the screen just goes blank"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't add new note, keep showing blank. Widget is not loading."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the recent update I cannot access. When I put password in the screen just goes white. On the only time I got in it then removed my password. Sweet password back up and again won't let me open screen again is white and no access"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't get into the app at all via my phone. Why?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Help! I love this app, used it for 10 years, but recently it's blank white. Nothing appears, all of my notes are gone. I see there's been a recent update so maybe that was the cause. Very disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is a good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Aplikasi ini memudahkan kita untuk mencatat smua pesan"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to login my any acount 😢😰😓"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't know what happen with the latest version. When I open, my screen just white. Anybody can fix this problem soon? Many important notes are in there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I lost EVERYTHING AFTER THE UPDATE EXCUSE ME? WHYYYYY WHY WAS THERE NOT ANY SYNC ??? I WAS USING THE FREE VERSION AND YALL JUST UPDATE IT AND I ACTUALLY LOST ALL MY INFORMATION WHATS WRONG WITH Y'ALL ????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Downloaded, logged in, and kept getting a Client Debug Mode after declining the trial for the paid versions. Uninstalled, reinstalled, logged in again, and kept getting the same message after declining the trial. Seriously? Think that this issue is going to make me WANT to try out features for a paid version? Yeah... NO."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Pathetic app now....notes not opening!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app screen goes white, with no other indication of anything going on after I've used my fingerprint to log in. I've used this app for years and up until now, haven't had issues. As it currently stands, the app is useless and the info I have saved in it is lost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App broke after recent update! All of my important notes are on Evernote, and I can no longer access them after the recent update. The screen just goes to white screen. My phone IS registered. The email address here goes to an unmonitored inbox. How do I get help for this issue? I really need to get into Evernote. I've been using it for literal years, and everything important is in there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been experiencing errors when accessing the app and therefore not able to access my data. Who can assist? Also, I have upgraded the plan, but it didn't seem to have reflected accordingly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keeping the tendency of decreasing the app quality with every other update. With this update, some of the settings went to hell and needed to be readjusted; back button closes the tool, no matter if it is tapped while having a note opened or in the home screen. I could see so much for 2 minutes. Don't know if you have a practice of hiring only freshman college programmers, sub-par programmers or just your project management sucks. But you are the epitome of low quality software development."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ads and upsell prompts intrude more aggressive than ever, to the point of making the experience of journaling, which is supposed to be intimate and personal, of using the app insufferable. I highly recommend finding a better app, as I plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am not able to open the app. The screen goes white"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since the update on the 12th my screen is white once i unlock..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Stopped working after last update. Just white screen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Find a different app. The constant popups asking for money isn't worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"The mobile version (app) was working great until today. Now it does not open. The computer version is working without any issues."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm trying to update in my new phone and keep being directed to a page that has all kinds of computer lingo on it. I even uninstalled the app, and installed it again and I'm having the same problem. I'm not able to use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I log in the screen is white. I cannot see to do anything. Please advise"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor, started out ok, but now it won't even open, and all of my personal data is locked and unavailable. Just previous to it not opening, I had to go through a refusal to update to a paid plan every time I went to open it. I only used for this one thing, and apparently that data is gone forever. My opinion is don't use it if you value your data and your time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"been working on ZFold 4 until last update. open app hands on white screen. uninstalled reinstalled multiple times. please fix this, I'm not paying monthly for a white screen + I have tons of saved info I need on the go now"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i ve been using it for more than two years. I was really satisfied with what it offered. After the last layout rework, it takes a lot of time to open a note, and generally yo open the app. The last 3 days i cant open the app at all. i put my code and i get a white screen. Fix this please.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using this app for years with no problems, but this latest update has screwed up the app. I just get a white screen after login. So frustrating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ever since the update rolled out, I get a white screen after logging in through my thumbprint AND my pin. Please fix this as I need to access my notes ASAP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I open the app it goes into debug mode. Unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many glitches... Takes so much time opening a file.. doesn't sync properly with my other device..slow... Frustrating... Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of 7/19/23, I can't even access my account without issues such as client debug mode popping up and will not go away whenever I search my account or edit my account. You guys need to fix this problem ASAP. I've had this account, the free version for years with no problems, why now?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is unusable after last update. Text is not copying to my clipboard like other reviews and it's been 24 hours now that every time I log in on my phone, the screen is solid white and does not display any of my notes. I've also experienced multiple security breaches from India. So disappointed as there is no customer service of any kind and the whole reason I switched to Evernote years ago is because of lost data and information. Time to look elsewhere and be done singing Evernote's praises."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basically to give review I have to use app but I am not even able to sign in OR sign up. I tried to sign in and sign up for many times, it's just loading forever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working on S23 Ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Decent app, wish theyd include ""different colors of highlighter"" It's a basic function that almost all the other note apps have. Also the ability to save recorded audio files and transfer them to the computer (outside of Evernote) seems to be missing. Please enable the ability to rename audio files and create a galaxy 5 watch version!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote since the beginning of time & paid for the privilege. It used to be great and way ahead of any other cloud based service. However, I'm not sure how long that's going to continue. I can no longer copy pdfs to my Evernote files. The update today, 19.07.23, has just rendered it useless with a white screen after signing in. They've been bought over by an Italian app company, Bending Spoons, but if they don't get their act together pretty damn fast, they'll not have a business."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Congratulations on totally borking the app with the latest update. Ready to move on from EN."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Using paid version. Recently the data is slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After update cannot open the app just plain white screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Screen keeps going white and can't access notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Each update the product becomes less usable, more and more bugs are coming, old bugs are not fixed, performance is getting worse and worse. Guys forced me to migrate to different system"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Started having problems where I'd try to open it and would get a blank white screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled, but now it's frequently going into debug mode in the middle of editing notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't know why I kept seeing a blank white page on my evernote platform instead of my notes, please fix as soon as possible."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Blank White screen since update 7/18/23"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After updating, The app shows white screen only. Nothing else. Disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Edit: Cannot access on browser. Lags and hangs helluva lot. Previous drawback remains. Can't access my notes when there's no internet. I understand it's cloud based but an easy workaround would be to store a offline version of the updated file and then upload once internet resumes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Same as the other complaints. After the update only opens as a white blank screen, app is unusable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hello developer, kindly fix this bug asap. It's just showing a White screen upon entering the passcode and nothing else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since recent update app when the app opens it just displays a blank screen (android OnePlus)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just freezes on white screen after opening, can't access thousands of notes. Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great tool, use it for years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app goes to a white screen when I log in with my password. I need to access this info, and I'm losing trust in your app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Move to obsidian while you still can. It isn't worth even trying with this application anymore - pure garbage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why it is stuck on a flat white screen? Any fixes coming out soon? Or this is temporary? Any clues?? It a great app, although I hate when such overly unexpected issues comes up when you least expect them!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using it for a long time, but now I can't open the app, just keeps crashing every time I open it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant Ads for Premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great app for notes and other reminders. pro needs to be a little cheaper"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've loved and used this app for 12 years, always recommending it to others, it has gone from free to $17.99 a month... For notes. That is an outrageous amount. There was no warning either, had to pay the $17.99 just to keep from losing 12 years worth of notes so I could copy paste then somewhere else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stopped working on the Samsung S22 Ultra, always shows me that advertisement to go pro, it either crashes or freezes or you just get nothing. Other S22 people are having issues as well. Please fix this, going to have to find another app to fill this spot if nothing changes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote was my go-to notes app for a bit over 10 years, but its recent bursts of desperation ended up pushing me away. Between the absurd price hikes, the features that keep getting locked behind an unnecessarily expensive premium membership and how often I'm prompted to become a premium member, I've finally decided it's time to move on. For those who don't need a web browser version of your app, UpNote is worth checking out. I've already subscribed to their premium after just a couple days."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dont lnow what is going on with this app lately but it is full of bugs and the two step verification is a huge pain to use. I just migrated to a different platform because I cannot risk anymore using this. Get your stuff together evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like it! works well"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hi for the past month the app won't open. I've updated and it still won't open What else can I try."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After some update S Pen on Samsung s23 didn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like all its features, it's quite handy and I use it for all my note taking. However it has had some bugs with making task notes lately. It won't let me add a new task and when I try, the whole app and my widget crashes and won't load anything. Also, only being able to use it on 2 devices and having frequent pop ups to buy their premium services is quite annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the hell this app has become, so many imp password and doc. Are saved but can't access them. They want freaking ₹24000 ?????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Its just goes blank"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great til it stops working and no one is available to help you! White screen shows up and nothing works! The developer email does not assist. They direct you to troubleshooting and suggest opening a ticket but surprise! no option or contact info is available to do this. No chat reps available due to ""high volume"". Looks like many of us are stuck. I paid for an app that has no support when it glitches. Will be searching for a new app immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"they didnt charge before"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Totally can't assess the notes and amend. Not sure what happen. Really disappointed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was excellent - not anymore! Just get a white screen once I unlock it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"is good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I leve tristeza app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"DEV: I've been your paying customer for years. So far I've got 8,699 notes! I recommend this program, however, one thing is driving me crazy.... The clipper has suddenly stopped working. I think it's been about 2 weeks now. I can no longer save anything to Evernote from a 3rd party! This is ESSENTIAL for me! PLEASE FIX, AND THANK YOU!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst synching and money making grab. Can't even get help if not paying. I have changed device can't transfer notes. Longtime user. Lost all data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote, years ago, used to be a good company with a good product and service. They are now one of the most dishonorable companies with the worst policies. Their apps went from great (years ago) to bad, to worse. Again, follow in the path of their bad habits they came out with this update which broke the features that were at least working. Don't trust this company. Don't invest in buying their software services and don't trust them with your data or workflow. They will mess it up."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware that if you should go over the storage space that you paid for, they will lock you out of your account if you do not upgrade to a larger storage. I felt like my notes where being held hostage and would not be allowed to delete notes to continue paying for the same storage I had. Also they threaten you to not use more than 2 devices in which you have to decide which 2 devices is most important. Just not worth it. After they blocked me from my notes even though I had 5 days left. I quit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's been 3 months seen I keep randomly got new device that I don't recognize added to my Evernote. Sometimes Apple devices, Oppo phone, etc. None of the device are used by me nor my family. Are my account being compromised or what..??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Great app...but now it won't open, keeps crashing. I hope I don't lose all my notes!!😟"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have not been able to open my notes for the past two weeks. This is not good at all! I enjoyed using the app; however, right now I am not a happy camper!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not a bad app but out of principle I have to give it a 1 star because of the constant bombardment of lies about their offers for the paid version. Every time I open the app it pops up and when I decline I'm asked if I'm sure and that I won't be able to get the offer again. Even though the same offer is there every damn time. Very frustrating , I'm likely to try one of the many alternatives available."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of the best note taking apps I've used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have used this for more than 10 years. Decent organization of notes. But be certain is un-usable. Android Edge or Chrome browser cannot export webpage to Evernote. Please fix it. The home page layout is full of useless fancy pictures but useless. Evernote is forcing users to upgrade in order to arrange the home page layout. Inside the android app, I can search the note by keyword, but when I click the search results, nothing happened. From a lloyal but very angry user."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really love Evernote, but recently everytime I open the app I just get the white screen and I came into a panic mode because I have a lot of personal much neeed notes in there, thankfully it's working again properly because I did the uninstall, then reinstall. I hope this may work for some of the people out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's my second brain now that my fist one seems to have gone on a permanent vacation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like Evernote. It truly does what it says. Great kudos to them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The widgets don't work, cannot save notes through them. I can't save notes through the app either. It simply won't load. I've lost countless amounts of notes due to the app not even giving me an error message that the note isn't saved, so I just go around unassuming that my note has been lost. The app is unusable at this stage, which is a shame since I've been an almost daily user since 2014."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App no longer works. Just a white screen. Please fix"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"log in. white screen. delete cache, delete data. able to log in. try to write a note. got an error screen. no testing before production deployment?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless. Looking for a onenote alternative. This has sketch only notes (which is already a downgrade from being able to write in any note). The sketching clearly isn't important to the devs because it literally doesn't work. Tried with my finger, tried with a pen. Nothing happens."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"There have been a lot of recent improvements with both the speed of syncing across devices, and the ability to do it at all. This has made the app very useful now. One further improvement I would request would be to add a button to jump to the bottom or top of a note. It can be quite time consuming scrolling through long notes to get to where the end is, depending if you add from the top or the bottom."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Hello, since a few days the app is not working anymore. After I insert my password the screen gows white 🙄"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evenote is absolute incorrect working. The program looked as nice app but when I tried upgrade this app to better level it has become absolutely terrible. It didn't accept my common credit card and block my several joining accounts. Support centre is unworking for this money. So it is absolutely crazy to offer for customers such incorrect app with unworking payment process."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unsecured, hacked many times"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Updated 2023 Removed a star. Android version has been problematic for some time. I'm paid, works on PC and tablet, but Android has had issues saving new notes. Uninstalled and reinstalled, but a problem. Original review 2020 5 stars. Newest Android app is outstanding! Great implementation of design and features. Older versions were meh, this one works, clips flawlessly, has great design. Good job!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Cannot add a note to homescreen at the moment. This needs to be fixed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Back then you're so good, So easy to use.. Now you're suck! So many times i use the notes quickly, i already saved it, but when i open my note later, it was gone.. If i can choose zero star, I'll give it to you.. Thanks a lot!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using it for years, I have the paid version. Used to love it but in the last month or two I can no longer clip any articles on my phone and half the time I can't even open my notes - just a green line going across top but it won't open. Very frustrated!! When I try to clip an article to save there's a flash of a red screen with some info but it disappears immediately so I can't read it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have some shame; go and perish somewhere you jokers. The app is completely irrelevant. Smoothness has completely been lost. Trust and credibility has been lost forever. Without lag not even a single time I can use the app. I am fed up...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Well I've been using EN for 4 years (though from pc) but recently switched to Android. Devs! I'm having a problem when in any notes after writing, I try to go back, it disappears the keyboard and make it pop up again.. till I manually click Tick (mark) on upper left corner, and it is very frustrating. Also, when tapping in last line to add more words.. note should move up 2-3 lines automatically when keyboard appears. It's not moving!! This makes the app feel bulky. Please take care of these."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using the free version for many years and finally decided to switch to paid but lately the app isn't working well-- when i add new notes, system crashes and i cannot find the note anywhere! I get into the app and there are no notebooks etc. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it twice and still this issue. Really reconsidering my decision on this paid subscription"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So what's the deal with when you copy text, it cuts it instead and deletes it. Lost an hours worth of work. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This stupid app will NOT stop asking you to buy a subscription!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used evernote as my main note taking app for over 3 years and I still don't know how to replace it, but the consistent bugs are giving me more reasons to try. The last couple weeks in particular have been the worst. The android app will show a brief red error screen anytime I try to save a note through any means, and will either not load notes or will take several minutes. I really hope they can work out the bugs that make it unusable... Especially now that that the pricing has doubled..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I absolutely love Evernote. Fantastic for creating a second brain, archiving personal data, journaling, reminders, etc. Better than Onenote(although I use onenote for handwritten/stylus notes) UPDATE 7/15/203 It's happened more than once where I will write a note I've put a lot of effort into and it disappears. This is unacceptable.... I only knock off two stars because I understand the complexity of software"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Doesn't capture notes consistently on Android."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm a student and this app im using around 2 yrs, the great app for notes and very easy to use and compact"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What's up with the red screen errors? As a longtime Evernote Professional subscriber (almost 15 years!) who's used it as a digital filing cabinet, I haven't been able to save anything using Webclipper function for last two months. As a researcher, this is crippling. As a customer, it's insulting. Have un-installed and reinstalled, no dice. It does work on my laptop, but fails to save articles w/my Android. Whole Evernote premise now invalidated! It's now ""NEVERnote,"" not ""Evernote."" Not good!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to be great. Since V10, several useful features removed, and everything is very slow, when it works at all. Plus an unending string of bugs. Update a few months later: I don't encounter the overt bugs as often now, but it's still lacking many features that existed in the old version, like the ability to move multiple notes, and it's still very sluggish. It's usable, but I resent that they've forced this ""upgrade"" that is inferior in every way. Edit July 2023: more serious bugs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was great. Been using that for years .But after latest update i cannot directly pin website into my note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a user since 2014, and I generally love the app, especially now that they've worked through some performance bugs that were slowing it down a couple years ago. I have to say, though, I'm about to migrate everything and quit the app because of the incessant prodding to purchase a subscription. So unreasonably annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I really do like this app, especially the fact that you can secure it using a passcode and/or your fingerprint. Unfortunately, every time I go to unlock my notes either by pin or finger, the screen just goes white. I have heard from others that the device might not be registered. This device is registered, and the problem is still ongoing. I won't be able to secure my notes if this keeps up. Other than that, a way to organize notes further WITHIN each notebook would be great."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use love this app. I was going to upgrade but now when I click on the app all I get is a blank white screen. I updated the app, and I still only get the blank white screen. Please fix."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointment. Lots of bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is broken. Get past the log in page to be greeted with a white screen and all previous notes have gone. Never moves beyond the white page. Not sure if this is a server issue or app problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's all blank. Been using this for years and just opened it and all I have is a white screen. There's information I need in this app and I can't access it. What's going on?"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using the premium version of this app since 2016, but it's been crashing lately, and it's becoming increasingly unstable. Based on the reviews, everyone is having the same problem, so fix it already! Problem Solved‼️ Evernote laid off all of their US based staff. What a waste of potential. Time to find an alternative and switch."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Its good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app (premium paid version) untill one year ago when it started freezing, taking ages to save a note and now even reached the point where unable to save a new note. Considering new options as this became unbearable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been using this app for over 6 years and I have enjoyed every bit of it but with this recent update, the app closes on its own, doesn't sync and I can't type without it for a minute without it removing my keyboard screen .Can you please fix this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not able to view my notes since yesterday.... just putting my security password and see blank page on my mobile...... kindly let know what is an issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After using Evernote for 12 years, they abruptly doubled the cost for ""Personal"" with no value added. $129 per year for a note app is outrageous. I think about 5 years ago, I paid $29/ year. And that was enough. But an ability to sync to multiple devices allowed me to justify it. No more. Stay away from these greedy bums."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"u can use only one acc"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's a great app. Synching with the desktop has also been excellent. However, recently when i go to copy text from a note, it actually cuts it, and eventhough my phone displays the quick message of ""copied to clip board"", when I go to paste, the info is not on the clipboard to paste. There seems to be a bug/disconnect when you copy or cut the text on the mobile app, it doesn't make it to the clipboard. The only way I can copy and paste is to go onto the desktop app and do it from my computer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years and always had an excellent, if somewhat limited service. It did what I needed it to do. However, since the recent price hike, the service had deteriorated considerably.  When creating photo notes the page freezes and does not upload When trying to put a widget on a page, I get a red error message box that quickly flashes to a box saying that I need to be logged in to create the widget. When I click on a message to create a note the page freezes Now its very poor"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too much features. Working slowly with delay because all the time trying to connect to server."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app - not any more. Also, they make it unbelievably difficult to close the account. I was bounced back to the home page 4 times before I finally got to the end of the process. It feels like this is to discourage you from closing the app. Shabby."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Uninstall and re install it. Works perfectly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Since update, no longer able to save web pages to Evernote. A red warning page flashes up, but too quick to read"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use Evernote to write. When I get past a character limit, the phone app informs me that it can't detect further grammar errors. Once or twice, fine, but I can't write a sentence without the alert popping up. This makes the app completely unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Trying to login into my account is a herculean task. The app is good but this is my sole problem with it. Kindly fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Overall good but annoyingly slow, even with just basic text documents. In 2023 it's still, at times, very slow. Like 1/3 times it'll take a minute to load a text document. I like the many ways to record notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Notes keep duplicating. I spend more time deleting broken notes than adding to them. What a rediculous problem to have even though I use a single device.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using for years, but recently app has been becoming worse. One time it kept crashing.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Android app is extremely buggy. Notes don't load more than half the time - it's not limited to large notes with a high character count/images.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So after years of persisting with Evernote new release ups and downs the web clip function on Android that I heavily rely on no longer works. After a couple of weeks to and fro it turns out it's a known issue and a new release is required to fix it. Release date not known. How bad can it get?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this is the best tool for save your notes just log on your account and have a safe play"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used the paid version of Evernote for 10 years and the application seems to get worse every year! The app is slow to load and index files, it creates duplicate files, and now opens files at the bottom of the file (earliest entry) so you have to scroll to the top of the file. I provide feedback to the developers but never hear from them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I don't know what happened with the last update, but I'm not able to clip articles. I tried submitting a bug report, but that wouldn't go through. I just get the spinning wheel. thought maybe uninstalling and re-installing the app would help, but now I can't even log in! This makes me wonder what I'm paying a subscription for?!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Please i am having issues with your app since May 2023. I did my May subscription but ive not been able to use the app till now because it keeps shutting me out and asking me to subscribe to a higher amount. I even tried to subscribe but it wasnt going and it keeps saying ive subscribed for the month and yet i cant use it. This June #17500 was taken from my account again for subscription what is happening? Even at that the Evenote is not still working."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The widget no longer works since the last update, notes taken from the widget don't save. Without that quick note feature, the app isn't particularly useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Widget doesn't save your notes occasionally. Evernote is like that person you keep around in your life because they serve a purpose but you know you deserve better. Will keep an eye on Bending Spoons to see if they'll also bend some forks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hoping for the best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disappointing in every way."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now I can't share articles with Evernote. I used to have the paid version when this app was great. Then it started to suck, and finally I used the free version. Now it lacks even basic functionality. PS: the company does not answer its email. The link for support didn't work. You can't start a chat either because the chat service is overwhelmed. Edit: Now I can't even see previous shares. It just keeps trying to download. Earlier today everything was finally downloaded; now it's gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Latest update has rendered this app unusable on my device. Even after uninstalling, restarting, re-installing, restarting, etc... I mainly use the app to take quick notes using the widget. Notes never save! After 10 years of being a loyal user, I'm going to uninstall this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Version 10.51.2 is completely broken & won't save anything from Android phone. See EN's user forum for details while we wait for them to hopefully release an update that fixes it. I've use Evernote for over a 10 years and sadly it just keeps getting worse."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great until it wasn't. Now when I try to save something to it, it only opens to the minimum app. I pay for full version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"best note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a great note taking app but now it's almost unusable because of the incessant ads trying to get me to upgrade to the paid version. Often a full page ad will pop up while I'm in the middle of taking a note, and it takes several clicks to get out of it. It's absolutely obnoxious and there seems to be no way to permanently turn them off."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have one week using it, I think it's useful as I discover new things I can use it for. it's nice the synchronization between devices, so I can have all my notes everywhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App basically broken for most intents and purposes. I'm having to use the always reliable Google Keep notes for most things at the moment as Evernote is malfunctioning all over the place since a 16.6.23 update. I can't share any image files like screenshots, and now the notes list widget refuses to add notes. I'm told to wait for a fix for this known issue..... I used to be such a fan!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't log in"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's very disappointing to see how they're increasing the subscription prices to a whole different level. I have been using it for a year now and have all my stuff there. But it's difficult to pay such a huge price for note making especially as a teenager. Evernote must do something about this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This latest update crashes most of the time! I've been using the product since 2012, this update makes using this IMPOSSIBLE!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wow.. What a powerful App, Beautiful and Awesome. It helps me to connect to my Laptop, without any problem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I love this app and have been using it a few years now. Since I switched to the S21, the widget stopped working. I can no longer add or check off tasks using the widget."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am uninstalling this app. The widget is not working and yet, you have the audacity to offer a premium service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"often has bugs Already updated to most updated version, Can't send note to home screen , make me trouble!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote seems to be getting worse with each upgrade. I am no longer able to simplify formatting (or to even remove formatting) from content I copy/paste from the internet. This was an extremely simple task on older versions. If this major flaw isn't fixed soon, then I will have to find a more intuitive note app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have a decent phone with andriod 9 currently operating. But as soon as i download it and try to login (i have an account on evernote-web), it just keep loading and loading for hours and doesn't go further, although having a great internet connection.

I'm a premium user and the last 2 months, I keep getting red screen errors when I try to share our clip a website, or document. I went to the developer support forum and followed advice to uninstall & reinstall... But you have to do that everyday... Because it keeps happening. Frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hope was significant rise in cost signalled a commitment to improved experience, and so I hoped to return to Evernote as go to app for notes and organization, & work flow more fully. But current app experience is the absolute WORST yet , extremely unstable, signing off & making itself & my notes unavailable randomly in the middle of research and work. ( App settings claims I am signed in.) Turning device on and off, uninstalling and reinstalling work for a few minutes or a few hours, at most."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Downgrading my review again. The app is now completely unusable. I am prevented from creating or accessing notes unless I upgrade. I won't be using the app anymore. I have used Evernote for several years and enjoyed it. The recent updates added helpful features, but the changes to account types are destroying the utility of the app. E.g. Spamming of ads to upgrade. Upgrade features don't feel valuable. Support only available if you upgrade. Removal of previously free features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app became very slow once moved to a web-based framework. Giys, this is the application and it should not be a web frontend! People are not always online they want to use the app offline as well. It is stupid how slow and unstable it is now. Whether the normal ""legacy"" version is still available?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Best available note pad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Crashes irregularly. Takes over 30 seconds per capture. No way to put it in the top 4 apps listed EACH TIME for data transfer use. Usually around 14th, or under MORE, as an option for output! Most text captures don't show-up in Evernote results for hours or a solid day! No automatic tagging by key words within my text captures. Tagging manually is almost impossible; Only pre-existing tags are useable within a Android cellphone.... Are there MANY different ways to view the saved data?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good , the todo tasks Widget doesn't work as intended, You can't add new tasks , sometimes the app says I have to log in even though I am already logged in. Some notes won't open or load , I need to keep cleaning the cache to use it. What happened to this app?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Try for free""!.. first give us all your info for billing and if you don't cancel it we will charge whatever whenever for however long. I spent almost 20 mins adding in different tasks. But you can't even see the list of tasks in full unless you surrender your payment details! You'll not get mine. ...And you'll never know if I've done any of the tasks I typed in before I found the pay wall. Poor form."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't use widgets since the last update. Every time I try to write a note and hit save, a red warning screen appears for 1 second and my note is not saved, even offline. I had so many thoughts lost forever because of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Client blows chunks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wow note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Sometimes notes won't save and will revert to the previous version. It's done this for about 2 years now. It also will bombard you about buying premium with an ""exclusive offer just for you"" almost every time you open the app. Other than these two glaring issues, I think the drawing pad and ability to put notes into folders are great features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app was fairly functional on my phone, But I constantly got attempted hacks on my phone and 2 weeks ago I was completely locked out of my account and there was no way to reach out to anyone to get the issue fixed. I filed a complaint on the Evernote website and never heard back. Very disappointing because I had a lot of important notes for my business on there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: Now that notes with graphics won't open half the time, I finally canceled my membership. Migrating to Google was easier than I'd expected"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote but it's stopped working properly. Web clipper doesn't work. Adding a new note is hit and miss. I pay for Evernote, but I'm no longer able to rely on it. I've been a happy user for many years - but now I'm looking for an alternative (and I'm worried that I'll lose the notes which I have in the app.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"So recently the app seems to hang a lot. I've had to uninstall and reinstall 5 times so far. It won't allow me to save articles, getting a red screen saying something went wrong."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"If I drop my old device then why the backup not restore to my new device ??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used it for years. Absolutely garbage now. I don't know why they aren't ashamed. It was once great. It really was."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has done a great job with this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Beware! Evernote doubled their price for their product and made it impossible to cancel our accounts. They are new, crooked owners of Evernote Corporation. I plan to broadcast their crooked dealings all over the internet until they cancel my account and stop taking money out of my bank. Beware of these new creeps!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not open anymore. Uninstalled, then reinstalled, rebooted... same problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a good app. Now it's laggy, slow and buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"A great app gone to waste... My notes don't save correctly, offline notes can't be edited while offline, completed tasks leave a blank space on the home screen widget, no handwriting capabilities, and seemingly no motivation to fix any of it. I have been a long time paid user and I'm reaching a point where I don't think you deserve my money anymore. Time to search for an alternative..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"My Desktop version is not working. I facing problem in login page , this page didn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is Buggy and Slow Do not use this if you want a functional experience. It no longer works like it once did yet they raise the price. You can no longer even connect 1 calendar with the ""free"" account. Go elsewhere until they fix everything they jacked up & stop being so greedy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app for notes + bookmarks management via the ☁️. Shame of the limited and way too pricey premium options for small users."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Samsung S Pen not working. I saw many has submitted the issue via the forum. Is there going to be fix soon?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally unusable. It's constantly pushing for paid subscription and its free features are limited with unfriendly UI."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is corrupting saved notes. Search function is not working properly in notes in REALME 8 5G mobile. Fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have loved this app for saving and organizing articles. However as of the past week the app will not work at all (I know there was an update on 6/29 so maybe that was it). When I try to grab an article I get flashed with a red screen of death. If I try to open the app I get a screen with the icon and I'm unable to do anything. I hope this will be fixed so I can retrieve my years of reference articles."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've had a paid version for many years, and too often it freezes, hangs, crashes, and I can't create new notes or edit older notes. I'm hoping to find a decent alternative before my renewal date. When it works well, it is great, but hanging is very inconvenience especially taking notes during meetings."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great tool for everything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app lies to you - whenever there's an ad push that wants me to upgrade to Premium, if you click No Thanks, the ad will say ""you won't be able to get back to this offer"", which is a total lie. I can totally get back to the offer - the same ad will come back later (probably the very next day). So, either stop lying, OR mean what you say (i.e. if you say I won't be able to get back to the offer, make it so the offer doesn't show up again)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thieves and liars, stole my $15 after I canceled during the free trial week. Subscribed 27 June, permanently canceled account 30 June, charged 4 July."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I came back to this app after a long time away only to find there is no useful free version. 60MB monthly limit and constant requests to upgrade to a paid version. No thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote is absolutely AWFUL as a notes app. Been a paid Premium tier Evernote user for 10 years and every time it gets a new feature the app slows down significantly. As someone who wants a no-frills cloud notes app and is happy to pay a subscription for it, this app gets worse and worse each year. Five years ago this was the gold standard of cloud notes storage and was available on literally any platform you could think of (even Blackberry til it died) now it's just a bloated, unusable mess"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"VERY GOOD App . I feel much better comparing other apps."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been an Evernote user for over 10 years and the app has never been worse. Slow, freezes, glitches and loses notes. Unacceptable! Finding a new place to keep all my notes..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used Evernote for years, and in the beginning it was great! But the last few years it has been consistently buggy with updates rarely helping. Notes randomly fail, duplicate for no reason, or completely jumble themselves. Worse yet, they've increased the monthly subscription SUBSTANTIALLY, with only a more buggy product to offer. This is the worst I've seen it the app perform and I can hardly see why anyone would pay such a high subscription for such a damage product. Don't even bother"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After upgrade not able to see my old notes."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love. Then ads galore to upgrade, again and again and again. Goodbye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Give the facility of locking individual notes, otherwise the app is great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"July 2, 2023, 1 star....it's gone from best to worst. Now it won't clip anything from the web, and I can't get it to allow clipping anything unless I open and close it a bunch of times... Very annoying! 5 stars.... It's just the best! Anyone who knows me understands just how awesome it is to have me give all 5 stars with no hesitation."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is a good app but EVERY time I open it the app tries to upsell premium to me. I do not want it and do not need to be asked over and over and over and over and over etc. Please stop this nonsense and respect your customer. *** The above still applies - Evernote still constantly trying to get me to upgrade. There is no need for this to happen so often *** ** Further update. Evernote AGAIN constantly hounding me to upgrade. Give it a bloody rest will you, before I uninstall!!! **"

So one can't use while doing this. Windows PC ver. won't load and sync. Search function is not accurate. Remove the improvements done thru the yrs. If it 'aint broke don't fix. Now looking for another note taking app. Sgd. APM.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've used Evernote for years and it's always been awful with the features like insert link and copy/paste. It can hardly ever grab the text I want to copy. It just slides the pointer down the list. It's so annoying. When I'm trying to insert an image, it does nothing. It worked a few times but now nothing. Guess I need to find another app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"IT DIDNT KET ME SIGN INTO MY BASIC FREE INTEST ASKED ME TO BUY UP"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not 4 me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote I ditched you before because of the app continually not responding. I think I'm going to have to ditch you again. Fix this never ending issue of not being able to even record a note and the application not responding. For the premium price this shouldn't be happening at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wonderful app! I would it meets all the requirements of a portable and amenable notebook. Very good features even for free usage the restrictions are satisfactory."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome and easy to use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Cut/paste doesn't work in the app. Lost 3 years worth of notes when trying to cut a section out and paste in a separate note because you can't ""undo"" an action once the note is saved. Also, there are way too many ads for their premium version. It's gotten to the point where I get prompted for a ""limited time offer"" every time I open the app. If I wanted the premium version, I'd have let you know by now. Keep your trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Update. As of two days ago, the Android mobile Evernote app is malfunctioning. It won't clip from the web like it did before. I uninstall and reinstall and it works until I remove it from the current apps screen. I restarted the phone and it worked but again did not work if I removed it from the current app screen. Then I couldn't share a photo as a window popped up stating needed file permission. I went to the app details and it has all permissions possible granted. This is really disheartening"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I really like the app because i can use it on multiple devices and it does what it should do. But what i dont like that every time i now open the app it pauses and wants me to upgrade my plan to premium or whatever - i dont want to update, i dont want to see this message every time, it annoys me so much that i am thinking about using another app in the future"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The app is really good for note-taking! Organization is also very easy in it, and you can even link to another note in one. The reasons I only put 4 stars though. The performance kinda sucks. Nothing much, just loading time, but still. Another thing, the app is great even without their subscription things, the subscription is basically bonus features, so that's perfect. I just wish it would shut up about the ""limited time only subscription deal"", it pops up all the time, and I don't care."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been saving notes here for years and now they removed the ability to search the content of the notes for free. I'm so disappointed. They want me to pay $15/month for something I've had access to for years. I'll be looking for another note taking app. What's the point of saving notes if you can't search through their content? It will be a pain to move away as i have so many notes :( can't believe they decided to start charging for something so basic without which note taking is pointless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Other languages like Arabic is not well supported"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Would've been a 5/5 if not for being unable to turn on/off auto screen rotate. Such a simple feature that is not implemented."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The last 40 reviews all say the same thing. App is unresponsive, glitches, can't save tasks.. Even on desktop it's painful and unreliable. I've un-installed and reinstalled the app, and it's not the Evernote that I loved and recommended to countless others over the years. Been using since 2009, this is not OK, especially for a paid account."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"fantastic app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Installed on my Google Pixel 6, was working before the recent update. Now when I try to clip on mobile, it flashes a red screen so quickly that I can't read the error message, and then crashes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I nvr update my note and it got auto updated as last updated... This screws up my last update sort sequence. I always hate auto saving when I'm just viewing my notes and I didn't even hit the edit button at all! Just scrolling up and down reading my note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lmao can't even log in anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not helpful 😕 my phone is hanging 😒"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good and fantastic app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Have been using Evernote for almost 10 years now... it's a great tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unable to share any doc/pic. Always says permission required while all the permission are granted already. If I try to attach the doc/Pic from Evernote then it works, but sharing and saving into Evernote is not working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Massive bug in the clipper function on android. App keeps crashing and doesn't work. Have installed/uninstall every day for a week. It has been working fine for over a year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Links to notes sent in emails take me to the Play store, rather than to the app. And then from the Play store, I open the app, and the note doesn't open. For this reason, Notes that I shared with me are utterly useless. I cannot open them in the app. The app does absolutely nothing useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't open notes shared with me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So many paywalls that it renders the app useless for me. By the time I can actually get to typing anything I've lost any inspiration I had. Doesn't make me want to risk paying for premium because as other have said it's a very clutter interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Love the app but minor bug. After the latest update, I can't add a note to my homescreen on my phone without evernote closing. Other than that, I am an everfan! Update: the issue hasn't been fixed, yet, but I am giving 5 stars for excellent customer service and for keeping me in the loop!! I wish all companies were this awesome."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What the hell is the problem , it doesn't sync despite having a sound internet connection, lost much of my progress, very disappointed 😞😞"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not letting me unsync devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No longer saves notes at all. The widget appears to save them but when I go back to see them they're gone. Unfortunately I thought I saved several thoughts before realizing they're gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a 10+ year user, very disappointed and upset at all the changes over the years that has ruined the user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's a wonderful app. I love it. It has everything, including AI that does something nice to your notes - only except for letting you know that there's a sentence starting with lower case letter, somewhere in your long writing you've been working on for weeks. That, they haven't sorted out yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used to really love Evernote, and I used it on my phone and computer for both work and personal use. Lately though, every time I open the app I am prompted to upgrade to premium and I must confirm I do not want the offer. I do this every single time I open the app. It's starting to not be worth using it at all. I know these companies need to make money, but I'm even less inclined to pay for service if I can't even access the app without first choosing to not upgrade before I can proceed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is extremely slow."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be the best note app in existence. Now it's a bloated mess that locks basic functionality behind a paywall and constantly pesters for exorbitant subscription fees. The irony is that I would gladly pay for this app if the operation wasn't so transparently greedy. £8.75/mo for a note taking app is a bad joke."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote increasing prices ONE HUNDRED PERCENT in May. And look at all the 1 star reviews LOL . On my way to Notion as we speak ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the various features are useful, love the storage volume and starting to use audio for 'notes to myself'"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been using this app on 4 devices for months now. I have lost all my notes made 4 times and this is important work info. I can't count on this app to save my todo list!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been loving this app for years. But recently, them pushing their plans and trying to make me sign for a free trial premium is getting out of hand with the frequency it pips up. I'd open the app, 2 second later - pop, I say no tank you, bye. I'm browsing throughout my note and it pops again. It's annoying to an extend that I'll start looking for another app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"good"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"please Better Option 😊🙏"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't pay on general principle of not succumbing to rat leeches over charging just because enough rich people will pay it. Go to happy mod in browser and fight against companies pricing people out of trying to better themselves."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very useful apps"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Reviews"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Some notes, when edited or merely opened, simply erase themselves of some of their content. 💔 This is due to a still-active bug in the new real-time editing feature Evernote has pushed a month ago. The Evernote forums are full of reports of panicked users having lost note contents. This app can no longer be relied upon; what a stunning fall from grace from a company that you could trust (at least before they were acquired by an app factory studio)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Great until I changed devices-- notes lost for good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constant demands to pay for subscription"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the app for well over a decade and have loved it, but have recently noticed an issue. When using the app and laying on my side it rotates, ignoring the portrait mode lock that's enabled on my phone. I'm not sure where to report the glitch so here it is. 😅"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will not give any single star because of that upgrade window popup. I feel so frustrated while writing any new note and checking my previous ones. Everytime I open app that option of upgrade and free trail are coming, even after unstalling and reinstalling. Pls fix this Asap."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scam APP... Don't use this to fill in any personal details of yours.. I used it long back for a family trip to save some details They keep sending you emails that someone logged in to your account in some corner of the world and ask you to change password / enable two step Auth etc When you login to check, you'll see a pop that you have to upgrade to access your previously saved notes I closed the account itself.. Use your phones inbuilt notes or download something else but never use EVERNOTE"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Basic apps like this should be free"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Eh, it's not great. App is bundled with so many unnecessary features and fairly regularly encourages you to pay for it. It feels way too bulky for a note app, I just want a simple app to make quick local notes on my phone. Will switch to something else."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"One word: frustrating. How often have I found myself agonising whether my ""quick note"" has actually been saved to the app, refreshing and refreshing the app just to find out it has disappeared in the ether somewhere?

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ui is super zanky way too much ui bugs to deal just a terrible app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally everything is paid. Like something as common as changing the dashboard picture is available only on the paid version. Might as well make the entire app paid🤷‍♀️"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everytime I open the app, it shows the annoying the ad to buy a plan. I click confirm so many times. Why can't this app remember my choice? So annoyed with that pop up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Features increased but it is not simple anymore. Very slow in opening app, making notes, etc. In every aspect it slows down. Speed is the only thing we want in note taking app as first priority then features will come. Plus add option of zooming out and see note as bird view. Better use Microsoft 365 & one drive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great organizing app and that's what I downloaded it for and it was great while it was in my free trial and when I get to where I can afford to pay for it, I will install it back, but until then I'll have to use the free notes apps out there. I love Notebook. Best free version of Evernote to me."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I am keeping the 5th star in the hope to see a subfolder feature in Evernote. One of the best features of the Onenote app that keeps me pulled in. A subfolder feature will align perfectly with Tiago Forte's concept of building a second brain."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am unable to login my account. Its irritating"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Android app quality has steadily gone down hill since 2014. From the editor clunkiness to the constant ""one time promotions"" that appear daily after being dismissed, this has become really tiring to use. Maybe I should use the paid version? The free version doesn't really seem like a good embassador for the product stack. Also, eve logging in is a tangled web (after reinstalling to see if it would fix yet another frustrating bug re: not being able to add notes to home screen anymore)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Amazing app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This was my mind palace for the longest time (years). I feel stunted with note-taking for how pathetic this app has become in today's date. Doesn't load notes when I need it to. Like as if it has to buffer my notes. Slow in opening notes, sometimes doesn't open at all. At times refuses to save when I'm offline. How could I even think of paying for a premium version when the app doesn't even do well in its most basic of functions."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Usually this app is a 5 star. But for some reason the app is giving me an internal error on my phone and won't let me log in to my own account. Not even with Google. I contacted developers and they were no help. PLEASE FIX. Edit: Problem STILL NOT FIXED AND ONCE AGAIN UR FORUMS ARE USELESS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"See original reviews below. Dropped from 5 to 3 to 2-star based on experiences similar to comments after recent update! Now won't add item to screen! FIX! Still key for me on Samsung S23 Ultra - was great on LG G4, then problems on V50. Essential for organizing, productivity, keeping track of life in general. Versatile media. Love ease of use & flexibility. A top level app. Old UPDATE: Just tried their business card scanner. Works great for one-sided cards. Needs to add a two-sided card option."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Honestly I'm not sure just yet I haven't used the app for so many years now that I'd rather just start a new account (for beginners lol) listing FAQ, and all of the features/options that are included for free without any subscription or commitments required,.. there Are so many incredible Notetaking apps available - that are entirely free, I'm curious of the differences, but with over 20 current monthly subscript. srvcs that began as just 1 for $10/mo, unlimited ___ & no ads! great if I use it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I use Evernote, in fact, I used it almost exclusively for years. I found it to be fast and extremely proficient and I count on it for my everyday business note taking tasks. However, it's just too pricey. I read one of the comments above and I have to agree, it seems like somewhere along the line the original idea of Evernote kind of got lost in the whole profit margin mindset! Good things shouldn't always be about the money.. there comes a time when it's nice to just be... t.s."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very happy to use Evernote"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Man, this app has soo much potential! I've been looking for the perfect note taking × task management app for a while now and this ticked all the boxes, literally the only thing that put me off was the pricing for such basic features."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Account was accessed from another country. I thought Evernote was secure. Have used it since 2013. Got one notice on 6/11 that my account was logged into in another country. I changed my password and looked and actually there were 5 out of country logins same day. I contacted support and got a generic response to change password, enable 2 step etc. Then was told if sensitive info in notes then change it. Of course it was sensitive info - what else is the app used for. Disappointed with Evernote"

Can't believe how the latest updates can make an app so terribly wrong in everything. It's slow, it's not user friendly, some of the functioning has gone. Please revert the changes. It's very cumbersome to use it now. June 2023: 1 star Really don't know what's the point of updates. The app still has same issues for many years now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used this app for a long time and experienced missing notes. And I cam't even copy and paste my own notes!

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote just spontaneously deleted some parts of my note. I would love to submit a ticket with support, however, I don't have the means to pay for the ""privilege"" of contacting support (or accessing note history), so I'll just have to move apps after a decade. Users beware, the real time sync eats your notes sometimes – lucky that cross-device usability isn't the core appeal of the service, or anything. Oh, wait! That was sarcasm, just to clarify. Goodbye, green elephant friend-turned-foe!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"""Evernote closed because app has a bug"" Super Glitchy - it's either I can't type, can't copy, can't cut, note takes decades to load, I can't even 'add to homescreen' I'll be looking for another Notes App."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Another app that needlessly requires you to create an account so they can sell user data and metrics. Totally unnecessary for a glorified notepad and calendar. I've used this app for over a decade but it looks like it's time to move onto something less bloated and intrusive"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hey team.... can you please again focus on the app speed of the most common tasks? (Open new note and start typing, search and load the note, start app).

I have been faithful user of Evernote since 2010. I have referred many people to Evernote. EVERNOTE IS DEAD. It is showing all signs of a company that is dead. Go to NOTION.SO, everyone! 10,000% better! Bail out of Evernote before it is too late!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good service and works well on desktop, but not a good mobile app due to synchronization issues. Notes just don't sync all that well. UI is also weird for me, but that could be personal preference."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Few features I love in evernote 1) It can search smoothly across notes and within notes .Within notes it gives number of times the text contains the word searched 2) 10 GB upload per month (in personal plan )is better than owning a fixed amount space and paying for it .Even if I choose to downgrade to free version of evernote I can download my stored data.Which I believe is not the case in most other cloud storage provider which will not store the data in case I decide not to subscribe in future"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is.utter trash. It doesn't load any of my notes, you guys can't even connect to your own servers? My internet works fine but my notes won't sync and I lost one of my notes yesterday because I wrote it on this app, then expected it to be synced with cloud, or in the least, be stored locally till you can reach the servers.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I will never pay for a note app and would gladly switch to Google Keep if I felt like transferring all of notes my from Evernote. This app forces you to ""unsync devices"" to keep it free or pay to upgrade. I only care about using the app on my phone, so it's annoying that this pops up nearly every time I open it to access an old note.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can you set up some less expensive plan ,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Laggy, full of bloat. Constantly forcing me to pay for premium. Can only have 3 devices linked, after that you get two more chances before you just can't add any new devices without premium. Used to be the best notes app on Android, now is hands down the worst. Once I can be bothered to copy all of my notes to another app, I'll be gone forever. Do not download."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's meh. Very overhyped. Let me take notes without having to make an account maybe, you don't need to spam my inbox when I just want to make a list.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to use Evernote when it was free, and it was useful for my notes and I never lost them. I thought I'd pay for it if it was a one of payment as I lost all my notes on an app on a recent phone replacement. However I am not paying fiver a month!"

Free version is so limiting that it's practically useless these days. You guys should introduce a cheap tier for casual users, not everybody needs all the bells and whistles of personal plans. I paid one month subscription just so that I could migrate my notes via email to Gmail. It's disappointing."

In other words, it doesn’t just fait to provide the most basic note taking service, it can actually damage the notes you’d made elsewhere."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The screen sometimes goes blank and note doesn't get saved... basically the one feature that the app is promising doesn't work properly. also screen rotates randomly while phone-setting is to not-rotate."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app just literally does not work anymore. Ever since the total rewrite of the application, many important longtime features were removed, and the features that remain simply don't work. Very basic features like note syncing and searching simply don't work, and customer support is essential non-existent, even for long-time paying customers. The best thing to happen would be Evernote going out of business and this trash app disappearing into obscurity."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using it for many years, paying a monthly subscription, even opening a simple note there's a delay, instead of developing the app to include so many features that people do not use. Should focus on the simple necessities like giving access to the note, all I use are the search function, colours, bold, underline, bullet points and images, font sizes. No idea why there are so many new features which might be slowing everything down"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It used to be better and I am still using it simply because I had already been using it. I can't add images into it as easily anymore and experience more glitches than I used to years ago. So you can probably find something better, I just haven't got around to doing so."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"here's an update so you don't get confused about the older part of my review. 05-2023: we have to upgrade to be able to simply change the background or manage widgets?? why don't you charge us for keystrokes as well? you guys turned into a bunch of jackwagons."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It is a really cool application that has allowed me to take notes easier and in different ways. However, I have experienced glitches, for example: I was taking notes for 30min and suddenly everything got erased. No matter how many times I hit the undo button it would not come back. This has happened twice, maybe 3 times. It is a nice app, but I would suggest taking precautions to make sure your work does not get erased."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not work offline in the free version, which is just NOT acceptable for me. Other apps can do it. A big ""No! No!"""

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Edit: unable to use the insert feature to add pictures since the last update. Note conflicts are increasingly an issue. Duplicate notes are being created since the new format. Would like to roll back the update. How can this be done?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Had to upgrade my account to view my wife's notes in a stressful situation while she went into labor. Maybe try having a short trial when you need your notes instead of blocking access to users who need it now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"nice note making aap"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Paid subscriber, recent updates bring this app to a crawl when performing regular tasks, Evernote is AWFUL. For years been emailing tech support re checkbox feature and loss of formating with hard return converting paragraph to checklists that's driving me crazy with high loss of productivity in this and Windows version. Tech support does not consider this an important issue, but bloating a mobile app with tons of features that should not be in one, save it for desktop and tablet/pad apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"For a quick note app this app is awfully slow. Pls make it fast, the unsyncd text can me made to appear red but must do something for slow startup time."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a paid sub customer since 2011, and have recommended Evernote to more people than I can count. But after receiving word today that they're increasing my rates from $7.99 to $14.99 per month for no real new additional features, I made the decision to cancel my subscription. Sorry, but doubling the cost overnight doesn't fly when there are dozens of other apps out there that do the same thing for less (or free). Sorry, Evernote, you lost a customer. And I'm sure I'm not the last one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"After the latest update just hours ago, I cannot insert images into my notes on my phone."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love Evernote. USED TO. But now everything sucks. I don't usually leave a review on any app but I'm making an exception for this one because of how inconvenienced and incredibly frustrated I feel. My main issue is how it automatically rotates even if my screen orientation is locked. Even with reinstalling the app, it still happens again after some time! I also hate how the notes look now. I liked how big the margins where before because it helps me focus on the text but now..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fix the bugs properly and then dare to ask for 5 star rating. Can't even open my notes properly with even a decently strong internet connection. What good is your app then huh!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is pathetic..you write something offline and later its gone..it has happened several times..seriously do not use this app as you will lose ur important notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"New bug on the app: Notes are not loading on the desktop version. I have the paid version too. Please fix. --- IN GENERAL, when they are not messing this app up with new updates, it works very well - have been loyal to this app for a decade, which is why I'm passionate about it working correctly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since 2016 i have been using Evernote on anual subscription. I have been renewing on the 23rd zApril. So this year I renewed on the 22nd May and upto now 5days later it's still on Basic use not Premium. It fills the screen with upgrade request anytime I ooen it. Can you fix this so that I can go back on 5 Star rating I have been giving you all these years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"SECURITY BREACH! Didn't know a note app could be this dangerous. My account was hacked for some reason. Googled about it. And found out many others also experienced the same thing. This is a big no."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very slow! Not opening files! WTH!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good except its asks you to subscribe too much"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The laggy and sync problems keep on. I had given 5 stars but now only 1 star. They lost their mind. They do nothing to resolve the problems. Iam very sad."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very handy for taking quick notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Annoying pop-ups asking to pay. No ""Don't show me again"" option. I already decided not to pay, don't force your subscription to my face."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using the app since 2011 but recently it's been so buggy. They keep adding all these features and app changes yet the core functionality keeps on breaking. Yes even a paying customer can get ""we'll see what we can do zoned"" by their support. The handwriting feature is broken on some devices yet they won't fix it. Even if I cited threads on their forums dating from god knows when. I've installed and uninstalled the app to ""clear"" e everything in a pathetic attempt to use what I am pay for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Gets in the way of taking notes. Evernote is heavy, slow, full of intrusive ads and unnecessary features. I need a note taking software that doesn't get in the way of saving my thoughts quickly before I forget them. Evernote is the opposite of this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app to save notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I literally just downloaded it and the app has already decided that no, auto rotate isn't disabled so you can use your phone laying down, Evernote gets a special exception. This makes it unusable for me because if I'm sitting up I might as well use Evernote on my desktop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've had Evernote for years now. I'm very satisfied with what I'm using it for."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't want to pay for notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"!!!You can't make a notes app this slow!!! Quite polished and very reliable for so many years, all for free. For that alone deserves 5 stars. edit: getting slow these days. Note taking app should be very fast to open. Edit 2: Quick actions on long press in home screen had disappeared some time ago and still aren't back!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"nice but oftenly freezing on samsung tab 7 on sketch mode, can""t use pen efficiently..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Used to really love this app, but now the mobile version is broken. Only the first line of the note shows when you open it again. Auto saving notes mid note taking saves previous versions of the notes and results in lost data."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Excellent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uses to be great, now it can't be trusted. I have had multiple times where I was looking at a note and suddenly the contents disappeared, presumably due to a desync with the server. It also tends to create duplicates when it ""detects a conflict"". That's funny, because I am the only one using the account and only on my phone at the time. A conflict is literally impossible. I've ditched the app and move everyone over to Google Keep. Much better experience already."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Taking too much time to open previous Note ,please sort this problem ASAP"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I don't want to use your new, slow, laggy UI lacking offline notes when it's literally just a mirror of the website. Give me a compatible version of 8.13.3 for future android versions. Look, it's easier to download a cracked version of 8.13.3 with premium so I can install a working Evernote app. Amazing!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote support not what it used to be. App also poor compared to how it used to be. It needs to be simplified and layout improved. Also no print option on Android app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best notes app, EVER!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Previously had very good Experiences. Customer for 9 years. Am on the monthly paid subscription for Evernotes. Recent months when Notes delete on their own after they have definately been saved several times after Edits is unacceptable on a paid subscription. 👎5 stars down to 1 star. Especially after App updated & on new Android phone and that still happens. Wont be recommending & looking for alternative..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been a paid subscriber for many years and usd to be an Evernote evangelist. With each update, more usless features are added, while actual functionality is decreased. Most recently, notes fail to sync properly, with content being duplicated inside of the note, images vanishing, or conflicts occuring resupting in duplicate notes with diffferent versions. Everything used to just work. Now it weems I waste a lot of time trying to fix problems. It's time to find a new app."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"For taking notes, nothing comes remotely even close"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Web clipping does not work and notes get lost. The app claims to be clipping the article but then no note is ever created and the info is gone forever. Your whole thing is remembering things forever, please fix it. Also, please stop removing my review. I get a push notification that says you responded to it every time you do, only to find the whole review gone. Fix the app. Thanks! Edit: You claimed this was fixed and the problem is back. It just hangs with no explanation."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note-keeping app I've used. The ability to use it cross-platform and cross-OS is excellent!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Been using it for over a year now, it really helped me organise my life and thoughts. a few remarks would be : 1. it would be better if when you open a note, it doesn't start it from the beginning but rather from the place you scrolled down to the last time you used it. 2. i'd like to change the style and the color of the titles , it'll make them more distinctive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They really just want your money. You get bare minimum for free and you can't really do anything with it. Look elsewhere."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app so much until I upgraded my phone to android 10 and playstore forced me to install the latest version. It is very laggy, takes way too long to load, and it auto rotates whenever I move my phone. That setting should be toggleable and not set to ""auto rotate"" as a default. I hope this gets fixed soon since I really enjoy using this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Note writing and clipping not working. App updated, free version, Android 11"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was always great to use, but a dealbreaker that started recently was it loses notes and updates I make to notes. I would make a grocery list, save it, and close the app, only to find later on that the note is completely missing or only partially there."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every time I update my review of this app it remains a one star. This company's only strength lies in providing unlimited variation on a frustrating user experience. Their current flavor lies in constant errors saying that syncing is paused. On top of that, there is the many-years-long issue of multiple copies of whole notebooks appearing. I've got 4 copies of some now. So many other apps do the simple task of providing cloud based notes with no issues, so why bother with this garbage."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ARE MY NOTES SAFE HERE? I like the functionality of the app (tho it is slow), I did a 180 of my view of the company as they sprung an almost 70% price increase on their customers.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"superb App. Easy to use User Interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app. I dont know why Evernote discontinued the Web Browser Version making me download the app on my phone as well. The main problem is it tilts to a horizontal screen automatically even though I switched this off in my phone setting and I don't know where the Evernote settings is. The app is very poorly made where I can't even switch off the automatic screen shifts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Wish their wasnt so many ads for premium"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Pretty ok ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use the basic (free) version and while it does what I need it too, the device count is limiting and ads to get you to upgrade to the paid version pop up frequently enough to be very annoying from a user point of view. That being said, for what it does, it's convenience of syncing notes across devices, as well as reliability for me over the years (3-4+) makes me give it 5 stars"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After that update that changed everything I still find the app extremely slow, clunky, and even irritating with all those ads and pop-ups to rate the app. The absence of the widget and broken new versions of the app desktop as a bonus. That's it, the last update screwed all my notes which look like garbage now when opened. I'm switching to something else. Bye."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"🗑️ app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It is versatile, easy to use, what is not to love... Until 2023. The update in early 2023 has bloated the UI. Instead of quickly opening into my notes, I have to click thru a gauntelet of useless whatever, etc... Nothing I ever use. Finding my notes is actually an ordeal, EVERYTIME I open it. This is supposed to be a productivity app. You'll lose me to a simpler app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I find this app to be very useful and it has a nice interface. The only thing that would make it better is if the check boxes from the desktop app were compatible with the mobile version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Update: 5/11 It looks like whatever issue that has been plaguing me on mobile for the last month is finally gone! The app is the same, so it must been something server side. I did need to update the Windows version though. Old review: ""I've been using this app for years and it's suddenly broken now. Everything has slowed down to a crawl. I can't edit notes when I'm on 4G. It lags with every key press. Or just closes the note. Please fix this. I am a paying member of this service."""

All the notes that was written has been left with only it's heading and the first line shown.Rest of the content just vanished .If the app is able to take notes and but doesnt show it's content when needed ,then what's the use of this app at all.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A few years ago, I noticed Evernote getting slightly more bloated. But this latest update has made it unusable for me. Evernote traded usability, reliability and speed for pretty animations and photos. I have more than 5000 notes on Evernote but it's time to say goodbye. It is now useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the new appearance is really nice nd friendly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using this app for almost 10 years. It does absolutely everything I need it to do in the free version. I highly recommend it even for the ability to log in from anywhere and have all of your notes still with you. My husband has broken about 4 phones and has restored all of his notes with each new phone. Planning to move on to the subscription for more options! Definitely worth it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can I get help again. Several features dont work on the new version. One feature I use all the time, and without it Evernote is more of a headache than a help. I will change my review if I can solve the problem or revert to old version."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app gets worse all the time. I am a paid user and have been for a decade. At this point it is so buggy and nearly unusable for basic functions. Pricing sucks too. Notion migration looks somewhat seamless."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Stupid use less app I lost all my data"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So disappointed with the current state of this app. The price has gone up a lot and the functionalities have not kept pace. I cannot export to Google Doc, or even Word, I think. It's no longer working with IFTT and when I went to look for a link for a refund, I was unable to find it. So I just filed a dispute on the charge - no other option. I'm within the 60 day refund window but what good is that if I can't reach anyone there?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2 notes went blank without me doing anything to cause it. No way of undoing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this since 2014 and recently in a very short time the app has become completely unuseable, nothing loads correctly, it deletes information, it has problems syncing.

Along all these years I've enjoyed successful improvements as much as I've suffered questionable changes and failures, but I've always got top support from EN. Thus, the Android version released as of this writing solves tough problems I've been reporting on my tablet (not on my other platforms) for the last two releases, thanks to the support and involvement of the EN team. EN is a trustable tool."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 05/2023. New version still unusable. Share to evernote doesn't work. Share/Clipping function almost not working. App is slow and laggy. Notes disappering and many other problems. I used this app for years and it was Perfect. We have 113 accounts in my company and after more then 1 year of new release it still sucks. We are going to leave the app after 10 year of Premium subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was recommended to me as I'm an aspiring author. I signed up, and then could not access anything despite many sign in attempts. But, it was very quick to try to push the pay version. When I wanted to cancel and withdraw from it, I ran into further trouble and still not sure where I am. I would give this zero stars if I could."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"All the note present empty."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"NO LONGER WORTH THE MONEY. Nearly double the monthly subscription with less than a month notice is clearly meant to weed out the single user. I've been a huge fan since 2009, but I am now switching to Office 365. Word, Excel, etc One Note and 2TB of cloud storage for half the cost."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After all these years, you don’t let us to access for free limited options! Even I don’t have access to read my previous notes. This is disgracefully disappointing."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Serious BUG when typing in Thai. It inserts characters/vowels more than once. The cursor often moves back a few characters on its own to the middle of the word. I had to delete those characters that were inserted at the wrong position or those that the app added repeatedly. This is not usable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"using since 7 years. very useful. syncs both in mobile and laptop- Mac or Windows"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love Evernote. it's so easy keeping all my notes in one reliable place. It's always easy to locate the note that I'm looking for. Making lists and using the scratch pad go off without a sench. I'd recommend Evernote to everyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I don't know if my prior issue has been resolved, bc I haven't been in a position to try it. However, here are some big improvements: 1) The ability to turn off autorotate. There's no setting describing it, yet it happens constantly despite my phone being locked to portrait. Makes typing in bed impossible. 2) Allow us to customize our available formatting options. I use strikethrough all the time in writing. Now it takes two taps instead of one. Each new bullet point takes two, also. Annoying."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app Gets stuck and takes a lot of time The slowest of all"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great apps for storing notes and more"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A few key, consistent, issues create an annoying experience. Specifically, the app has not done a good job at synching updates made across multiple devices. Leaving me to restore lost material, and creating multiple notes with different versions, all of which tend to be missing content. On the mobile app (phone or iPad) if you select text and delete, it consistently deletes more than what you've selected. So I need to either rewrite the lost text, or delete things character by character."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this service for years, but they've lost me. I had a very important script that was halfway complete. Suddenly, it reverted to a much earlier version. Evernote wont offer me any support or recovery unless I pay them over a hundred dollars for an ""upgrade"". They wont even let me contact support. You guys just stole DAYS of work from me. I hope your company goes under."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Would like to see handwriting capabilities"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app. Now, it is completely useless. Recently I went into a note. All the information in there disappeared. So I tried to enter a new note. After typing in my list and saving it, I go back into the note to check it. Almost everything I typed in there was gone. So, I tried again....multiple times. But everything I type in just disappears. I have never had issues until 2 updates ago and now the app is useless to me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Update: Becoming more of a problem. Will not always open folder for editing purposes. Has copied large folders duplicating them into the app creating unnecessary data amount. Would erase them but afraid it might erase the original folder thus losing years of work. Also when saving links from YouTube subjects, instead of simply coping the link as before it puts the actual YouTube picture as in the platform. This takes up much space and makes Evernote look like your looking at YouTube itself."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is a nightmare to use. It's like being in an abusive relationship: some days everything is perfect, other days it's just a disaster. I've been having to switch back and forth between devices every time it stops working on one of them, which is often. The website lags to the point it's unusable, the desktop app doesn't save my notes, and the mobile app won't even let me log in. When it's actually working, I'm bombarded with ads trying to sell me premium. It's ridiculous."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"so slowwww"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Notes conflicts everytime. On the same device. Argh! I think it shouldn't open edition every time you touch on the note.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love this app. Now riddled with ads and prompt to subscribe to their paying service. What's worst is that sometimes it takes forever to access your notes. Unreasonable loading time for mere notes. I'm copy/pasting all my notes to google notes. Riddled with bugs. Just terrible for an app that used to be great."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app lags on Android, also it doesn't work if there is no internet. Why we use notes? If this app needs internet then we can save notes on our email. Why anyone use notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Thanks, I solved the problem. I've been using notes free version for a long time, just recently it stops showing the entire note content on my android mobile.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Impossible to log in via the app. I have been on the ""Please Wait"" page for 5 minutes and it's been like this every time I tried to sign in. It's very frustrating not having access to my files. I'm gonna have to rewrite every file I can on OneNote now. (Unless I can manage to login on the PC but I'm having trouble with my Microsoft account. I was hoping using the app would at least jump that hurdle)"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you Evernote for deleting my notes. You are just too hungry for money that if i want to sign in on PC you want the connection to be revoked. Anyways you dont have to delete the notes from mobile device at least. When i sign in I cant find my notes. you are utter disappoint and garbage. thank you. I created the notes on Android and when i want them to view in PC they were gone, I had 2 untitled notes which was created automatically at the time of login in PC."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Poor after sales. If can put zero style, I would! Been using this paid version of app of quite some years and had been happy with it previously. As mentioned like some users here. Am experiencing slow sync of notes to server. And worst case, recently my account was due for renewal. Card was charge thru play store. But account was suddenly downgraded to free account. Tried contacting help desk, takes them super long to revert. Been 3 days and no 1 had resolve my account issues. Expensive"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The price (personal is $10USD/month) and the intrusiveness are ridiculous. It's a note taking app, not MS Word and/or Photoshop. You can't even get the pricing unless you give up your email address. Why? And, it's all online and reeks of Big Brother. The novel was scary enough. Deleting this monstrosity."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just installed and tried to use the phone while lying down on my side. My phone is locked to portrait but the app seems to rotate anyway, meaning is completely unusable unless I sit up. I'll reevaluate if this ever gets fixed.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The app provides such a diversified experience to save your stuff and scroll up whenever you need"

Sync is super slow. So many other glitches. I don't know what's happened at Evernote but things need to improve fast. Refund requested."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally useless. You can't edit notes in the notepad. Obviously a cash grab. Do not give them your money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has randomly decided to make copies of my notes while actually erasing parts of them, making it nearly impossible to figure out where the things I'm trying to find are, if they're still retrievable at all.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login. Need my Notes on a new device. When I try to login it tells me it has sent an verification email. But it never shows up. Email is correct, not in junk folder etc etc. Can log into the Web version but for some reason all my notes are MISSING. In order to reach out for help you have to log in, which I can't do... full circle. The sheer stupidity is mind boggling. As soon as I get my old device back I will be migrating to a different provider. Awful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Excellent note taking app & is a high efficiency app. I've used it in place of the original S-notes app last seen on the Note 5. The most fundamental drawback would be exporting your notes or even just attempting to export for printing. It is in a format that doesn't allow a natural printer friendly file. The pages become overlapped into the tabbed sections on the page & cutoff. Rendering the ability to print properly an entirely cumbersome task."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"What happened to sync button on notes? In the previous update, there was sync button on notes which allows us to easily sync the updates. But now, we can't manually sync but wait for the app automatically starts to sync. It's not good. So, if it's possible, put the sync button back please."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The app is good, and has really helped me to take my class notes. But, but(we knew that was coming)☝️I would rate it 5/5, and recommend it to most of my medical students if it was easier to make good good flashcards for active recall. Please add that feature, and make it easier to use and make folders for flashcards. I dont know if I'm the one who just doesn't know how to do that, but I've searched online, and there just isn't a way. Add that, and you'll grab most university students"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using this app but now the app asks for the premium otherwise you will be able to use this app further. The app management team should inform everyone that after some time we need charges for the usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Honestly shocked at all the good reviews. I've had it for 10 minutes and find it completely unusable. Keeps aggressively trying to get me to upgrade before I've even had a chance to view the platform.

Really glad I don't pay for this app. Now it refuses to save changes then won't reopen the note so that one can start again. Garbage. Edit. STILL not fixed the dupe issues.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Recently Evernote has suddenly almost blocked users using basic minimum facilities which were free earlier. The option to give free use of App is the prerogative of the developer but allowing the users, free app use upto certain limit and then blocking the data without any sufficient notice to the users is highly unprofessional.

It's a shame they require a fee for personal use with all the limits (only 2 devices can sync, tasks require fee, Google calendar sync fee, etc) makes it pretty ridiculous. I could see paying $1 /mo ($12/annual) for personal use so I can share with my family but the free Google Apps paired along with an app like Band keeps everyone on the same page.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good and organised"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The below review was the beginning if the end. I am now cancelling my subscription, I now use the native notes app on my Samsung. The change to the widget is hideous and clunky. Which means it has now been removed from my home screen, where it had daily use previously. Quite disappointed."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How did Evernote go from being the No.1 notes app + Editors Choice to such a terrible app. Version 8.13.3 was the best. When you changed the original layout and started complicating everything it all went south. Bring back the original layout please!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It generally does a good job of synchronizing notes between my phone and computer, but many of the features require a subscription. I'll gladly pay for a fair price for an app, but I don't do subscriptions."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love this app but the current version is useless. The layout is cluttered. It's very slow to load and open. And, when you write an update, much of it fails to save so you end up having remember what you wrote and retype it. The PC version works well - but this one needs a lot of work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Only complaint so far is Outlook integration still doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was using this app for a long time for free. Now it is completely into paid service. This is very painful to say the notes which we created and saved already is not even open when we are not taken their paid service. Atleast the should give an option for the users to give access to their saved notes. Very bad service"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Preloaded, no uninstall option."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very unstable app. I use this to keep track of a lot of lists and tasks. This app used to be very good, which is why I don't want to Uninstall it. It has so many great features if they would work This app has been very unstable for over a year. When I try to edit lists or do anything for that matter it takes forever to respond then it freezes up and becomes unresponsive. Either fix the bugs or I'm looking for a different app. I keep hoping each update will fix the issues but it doesn't"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been a user of Evernote for 15 years, I understood the reasons for the redesign a few years ago and have been encouraged to see the features build up. However, for several months the sync engine has been basically broken. Looking at other reviews it's not just me. Contacting support brought a message saying they know about the issue. I'm getting 12-15 duplicates of a single note, with data either scattered across copies or, worse, just lost. I'm investigating OneNote"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been using this for 5-6 years, it is a very useful and quite handy but now a days I am facing some issues like if the note have too many words it gets hung and doesn't work. So please have look and fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst UX, tried to sign up using mail id multiple times but it was loading, loading and loading only."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible, made an edit and get thirteen duplicate conflicting notes! Ten years of notes and paid subscription come to sluggish, inaccessible end.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"🕉️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Better than others. Only 3 stars though, because of the glitches. #1 While typing, it will randomly delete words that were just typed or skip to the next line. It isn't constant, but it is frequent. #2 A note will randomly be duplicated. It says at the top of the original note that it was duplicated, so it's simple to delete, but it' strange that it happens in the first place without reason. I've been using this app for 5+ years, and I'm pretty sure it has had these issues for most of that time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Last months has been very difficult to use the app in my cellphone, because web and PC version is okay. But using it with my phone, I have had a lot of problems with notes and capturing web information. Even, I've lost notes. Please, help me!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Auto sync doesn't work anymore, but if you open a modified note instead it creates a new one saving original and old version goes to shortcuts for whatever reason. By the way, sync between devices was the main reason why I've been using this app for years"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used this application and now I can't get my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not waste your time. Notes are not stored locally, skipping the tutorial is a premium feature, and all of the powerful tools that make the app attractive are locked behind a monthly subscription paywall."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app there are so many different uses and I am sure some I am not aware of. My daughter is the one who recommended me getting it. I use it for storing passwords for apps, and love it for storing online recipes. I love how many options and the ease of applying my own notes to clipped recipes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They only focus on paid plans. Keep on showing the option to purchase and there is no option to keep using the normal free version. Worst app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Constantly makes duplicate notes because its sync is flawed. Now on my phone it suddenly stopped prompting for the unlock key and I can't even find where to reset it. Should be a free app!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Got worse the longer I had it. When I first got it I thought it was decent. But that's not even the worst of it. This app is SO SLOW. It constantly crashes, and lags so frequently. I don't know why it's this hard to make a decent note-taking app for Chromebooks. If you're looking for one, this ain't it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"obsolete"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't even install it! Their sync is a big joke. Even if you sync it manually it will never work properly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was typing the note for more than an hour and after pushing SAVE it disappeared. I've paid for the Personal plan to see the history of editing, but it says that I do not have access to it. That is very frustrating.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"it's nice to use."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I did not open my account 10 years ago with a Google account. Now, after adding app to my new phone, the app only gives me the option to open thru my Google or Apple account? Not very use friendly.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"glitchy app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notes randomly duplicate even if I'm not doing anything. Unfortunately the developer knows about it but doesn't want to fix it and there's nothing you can do to prevent it. Use a different note taking app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like the layout of this app and the different options it gives you as far as offering a variety of organization slots. I personally would love if it there was a photo option allowing my notes to have a visual it would make it easier for quick reminders or on the go type of situations. My son's as well are ADHD, they are used to being able to take photos n make notes and make their own little marks to make it more creative, personal,educational,fun and keeps them engaged. Adults needs it to!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"See this is not a forced review nor a one who wants to seek attention but the app is actually awesome and the desktop version syncs automatically and it's ecosystem is pretty great...."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This is gradually getting slower and slower on me. When I open a note to write something down it always freezes at first and I have to wait it out. Early on it was only a few seconds so I just put up with it but now I have to wait 20-30 seconds after opening a note before I can start typing. That is unworkable for me. I am on a Note 20 Ultra and only have a few MB worth of data in evernote. What's the deal guys? 3/23/23 EDIT: Doesn't really help if you don't respond to the email!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super otp"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"been using this app since 2015. it's an absolute must have and extremely reliable. only problem i find myself facing on the rare occasion is note conflicts. at times they'd create a duplicate of a specific note which i then have to delete. but that's about it 8/10."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"lots of posts on reddit of people having this application and having their crypto stolen. i fear this app is leaking information, or worse."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been unable to login since I formated my phone. What can I do?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"UPDATE - it still sucks. Notes still don""t sync between different platforms. Have uninstalled and reinstalled on phone and computer. All I see are notes that are months old. Premium customer for many years. Very dissatisfied customer. This app has fallen so far below the level of performance it used to provide. Notes don't sync between devices. Changes saved to notes simply disappear within seconds when you reopen it. Seriously in the market for its replacement. Anyone got any recommendations?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Gud"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Whay is it laggy when typing on mobile version? Thing i do is typing it on whats app first then move it to Evernote. However it is not effective since some feature like bullets or numbering or font styling from whats app is not the same as Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So handy for making lists, making notes with photos and text. I find it great for helping me stay organised, it makes it feel easy!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is very slow and always get hang"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They erase notes if you don't upgrade and provide zero assistance to recover them..unless of course you upgrade plan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Same deal with what a lot of the recent complaints have been here. I have been loyally using this app for 5 years now, and as an artist and songwriter it has helped me advance my career and make headway in the music industry. Now with the bug-riddled, slow saving, glitch erasing Android app I struggle to find efficiency or trust in this app anymore... The other day I lost an ENTIRE song I pulled from my heart. I cried when I lost it... Because I couldn't regain the exact writing I wanted. SOS 😩"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will not save notes. I paid for this service and it doesn't work properly. One of the worst updates yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I had loved and recommended this app for years in the free version till recently it has been popping out messages telling me I have logged into other devices and now it won't let me use it but signs me out!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app for everything personal, business and creative. I use this for all kinds of projects: to keep notes, todo-lists, project documentation, important audio or image files and personal journal entries synced across devices. Well maintainable structure using notebooks and tags. Powerful when combined with multimedia attachments and other features such as reminders and checklists. Thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used this app for about a decade and have loved it. However, recently the last year it is lagging on Android SamsungS22, and not saving notes when I try to exit hitting the check mark to save. I have to close down all apps on phone to allow me to re-open it. Then the note I just wrote will only have a few words of what I wrote in it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"storage for taking notes is very low."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"really helpful thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"not much html editing, nor apples WEBARCHIVE file format"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why I have to make an account just to take some notes I have no idea. Like great, yet another app that wants access to my Gmail account. I'll just use something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"the best!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Your app has many bugs. I advise you to test to create and edit posts to check them out. But sometimes entries are not created or are duplicated many times creating conflicting entries."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's really easy to use. I don't like how it keeps advertising how I can buy subscriptions, but apart from that, it is all good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"When it works it's great for quick or lasting notes and web clips. Long notes can get slow to show; even loading can get painfully slow!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What have you done in this update? Unecessary and bloated. Used to be a good app. Now just bloatware. Slow to load because of lots of annoying pop ups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"If you're on the free tier, it constantly subjects you to offers to the paid plan. I get it, they need to make money but since the free plan meets my needs it makes me search out a replacement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Makes you pay to sync to devices. Deleted"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can't recommend enough"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"is a very robust and useful productivity application. is more consistent and useful than OneNote. The only drawback is that this service is not backed with the other services that are included with Microsoft or Google's very similar rival services. However, because the core product for the team is Evernote, it's a much more consistent and powerful tool than the competing products. Which is why I am still rating it as 5 stars."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use Evernote for many things, i.e.: notes (memory issues), record picture for online purchase return, keep track of news headlines, keeping a medical journal this year with several upcoming surgeries. So lab results, appts, Dr Names etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has spiraled downward and expects you to pay for what you can get free in other apps, like reading your notes offline. What a joke!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very convenient, I have used this since college"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I love oldone version without this new fancy todo list. Just simple notes like on the web version with checkboxes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"If I am paying for the subscription service, it would have been nice to be notified that it was time to renew rather than just charging my card and sending an email after the fact."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Best Note App!! The only thing they can improve is adding a password saving option. They offer the best free version and even better paid! You can access your notes from ANY device as long as you know your login information. The amount of devices is limited on the free version but they still allow this feature for the free version, the paid offers more devices to be logged in at once. Hands Down the best Notes App!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good app for note taking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have always had nothing bad to say about Evernote until today, after taking notes for most of the day everything just disappeared without warning.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"While I use Evernote as my default note-taking system for my phd, the failure of the annotation in PDF mode in the app has meant I have to use a separate app just to annotate my PDFs. As this feature was one of the draw cards for Evernote the low quality of text in this mode, the super touchy zoom that is either too far away or way too close, and the inability to scroll through pages (instead having to open the side panel and select the next one) really detracts from the reading experience."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you did not intend for people to use Evernote on one device for free, you could just have offered a free trial and on expiry, that's it. Instead of offering a free one device app that keeps trying to armtwisting one to subscribe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent too1 i am using since last five year s a very handy tool to make notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I keep getting duplicate notes even though I didn't make them. It's very inconvenient. I might switch to a different app if this kept on happening."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Finding this app really useful to keep all my notes centralized throughout the years. Too bad it only allows 2 devices in its free plan. 3 would suffice for me but it's not worth the subscription for that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I am really satisfied and the app experience has been amazing soon fast"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible, slow, crashing. Many better free alternatives. DO NOT recommend!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I have been using this to keep track of my card-making supplies since 2018. It has been very useful. I'm still figuring out the latest update."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a decent app now their app and/or server can't speak the same language and I'm constantly locked out of my account. You can only have two active devices for free which is fine. But I often open the app and it says I need to revoke a device or upgrade my service. I would upgrade but 8.99 is way too much for no more than I use it. Anyways it keeps seeing my same phone as a different phone. I'll revoke the copy it made, logout, only to be told I need to revoke a device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"9$ a month for the ability of syncing your grocery list with your phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Will give a zero if possible. Been using this app for years. Paid version. Recently, the saving of the notes has slowed down. Any amendments to notes can be lost as it doesn't sync properly. New inputs not saved properly, causing me to lose data. Edit the comment because now, adding images is almost impossible. Saving note takes forever and u will lost 90% of your freaking note. This app is Waste of time!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"superb working for note ...create any type of note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A very complex program with lots of features, borderline on bloated, so it's not what I need... but has great customer service"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Es una aplicación potente y buenisima a la hora de tomar notas pero a veces la app tarda en responder y se puede volver muy tedioso. Aparte de esa cosita todo lo demas es perfecto."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After 11 years being a customer, i will be deleting it very soon. During that time, i dealt with buggy updates and buggy / useless new features. To top it off, today i received a 500% increase in the monthly price. YES. YOU READ IT RIGHT. 500%!!!!! I will migrate to another platform and sue them under the appropriate law. From now on, my recommendation? RUN! STAY AWAY FROM EVERNOTE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Tiring of constant begging to upgrade when the basic free version fails constantly. Always losing data from web to app as their sync is weak. Always creating extra copies of notes, sometimes 4-5 which I assume is attempt to minimize loss data from poor syncing. Will never, and I mean never, pay for a expanded version (subscription no less) when they fail with stripped down version"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be my go to app when it need to save notes but sadly it doesn't work offline anymore. Uninstalling because developers want to force users to pay for usage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Its good at what I need it to do – which is letting me view and edit notes back and forth on my phone and computer. But a lot of the organization options are locked behind a paywall (the home screen is endlessly cluttered and the only way to fix it is to pay), and while the settings are seemingly endless, there didn't seem to be a way to turn off the constant push notifications it sends me without manually turning off its permissions on my phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"too many pop ups asking for access. over last few versions this app became overcomplicated. Still using it because pretty good. but too many questions and pop ups"

I had a cellphone issue and have now resolved it - but the Evernote keeps timing out after 10 seconds and goes to a page that wants me to sign up and pay for it.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Creates multiple versions of the same note but usually missing the last few characters I typed. It also gets me to try and upgrade with an annoying ""are you sure?"" Every time I say no."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Не советую. Ранее приложение было в лучшем состоянии. Нельзя нормально работать с заметками на телефоне, синхронизация работает криво, одна часть заметки сохраняется, другая нет. В прошлых версиях такого не было. Ошибка уже как пол года точно. Производительнось приложения становится хуже. Конечно возможно проблема в бесплатном аккаунте, но хотелось бы узнать точно влияет это на производительность. В общем, лучше поискать замену, хоть и пользуючь с 2015 года"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app. helps me organize om the fly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Aside from the notekeepong system seemingly the least prioritized part of this app, they have just raised the subscription fees to $18 from $10 per month. It is extremly hard to see where the $10 was being spent - now it is double? But dont worry, they have a calender and a home screen! I would hope that an app that charges $10 per month for notekeeping, has a bloody calender and a home screen. What a stupid excuse to rip your customers off. Dont look for new clients, Just screw the existing."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be great, now it nags constantly to upgrade. Can't even access notes if you're out of cell service without upgrading. Some glitches that make duplicate notebooks. On the plus side, is easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Does not support e-inc like Boox Tab Ultra"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I hoped this would become my go-to app for note taking but overall experience was quite disappointing, mainly due to poor performance, awkward UI and synchronization issues. And this is not specific to mobile app, as problems mentioned are also present on web and desktop versions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Está muito lento, com bug"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app had been brilliant but then it got super super slow. It needs to be addressed."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Just loving it. Automatic security alerts are awesome, BESIDE MFA option. I can share with another ppl and see if anyone editing a note, and it syncs immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Really nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bait & switch deception... This was a decent app; I had not used it in a while and today went to look at an old note & now it has become a paid app & in order to see my old notes I would have to start a paid account, with a 7 day free trial available if you want to give your cc info before you can see your old notes created under the free version. Goodbye."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"2018 Great APP, too pricy especially student. 8 dollars a month for premium features. 2021 -Update after 2years; Now a completely unbelievably horrible APP. Useable. Real shame . 2023-Come back after another year.Still can't use the APP. constant harrassing pub ups to pay. Struggling to delete old notes and reorganise for new purpose. It is really unbelievable how this fatastatic APP has been damaged beyond redemption."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"so far my favorite note-taking app. love the back ups."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You can't customize literally anything without a subscription. Even tasks can't make it to your home, which I think is a very basic functionality for something that is suppose to track things. Uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They will harass you with adds when you actually need to use it. I switched phones and can't even use it unless I go premium. Move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fast, Easy to Use, Reliable, Big Capacity, Re-Read"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Supar"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"significantly helped my note taking and organization. I've essentially written a book three screenplays and a season of TV scripts from here"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has changed my life. instead of emailing myself or saving random notes on Post-its or my phone that I never seaw again, it stores every bit of information in an organized, customized way. I can then find it and use it. Brilliant."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Graeter's Apps forever! I miss it previously when I was not informed about this app. just Amazing app this is!❤️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"puuurfect 😺"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I would like to see the option of two people being able to remotely access the same document together while simultaneously editing the document. Right now, only one can edit, and the other can view only. Google Docs allows same time editing and real-time updates of editing from all editors. You can watch another person type in Google. In Evernote, you have to refresh the page to see edits. It's not a big deal, but we would appreciate the change. Thanks for your consideration."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Helpful notebook on the go! Use it daily to write down to do lists, reminders, shopping lists, recipes etc."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's very very good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Keeps duplicating notes (even when using one device)... I'm probably going to move to another note taking app. 👋"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"sayed as"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When are they going to fix the usability issues?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is extremely slow to load, as well as frequently hangs and even crashes sometimes. I am not a premium user, but I hope the developers do want to improve the experience for everyone, otherwise I cannot trust the experience to improve on upgrading to premium."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I know this app but I forget to use it so I installed"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent note app. The best I've used thus far"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"genial"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Been using since 2014 after latest updates app keep crashing, notes auto rotate, notes keep duplicate by itself sometimes till 100+ copies. I am so disappointed. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The Android app seems to permit old notes shared with you to just linger without the ability to reject or remove them. Access to support is hidden."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sign in with Google anymore. The button takes you to sign in with Apple. And you can't use the web login on mobile. 🤷‍♀️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Наконецто исправили первую загрузку. Убрали баг когда надо было ждать при плохом интернете. Спасибо!!! Но приложение все еще тяжеловесное. Если надо быстро что записать я использую Google Tasks. Иногда просто нет времени ждать первую загрузку Evernote. Большая ошибка, когда вы что то записываете, потом оставляете в приложение в фоне, потом возвращаетесь , конфликт записей и вы теряяте данные. Я так терял важную информацию. Если мне нужно схохранить чтото быстро или важное то использую другое."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app is just awesome. I have been using it for the last 12+ years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"for demanding a star rating!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Have only ever used the free version. I find it really helpful for keeping track of information I might need to reference later. And also means that the information isn't stored on one single device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been having issues with this app. I do have the paid version. After I make a note and hit the green check mark in the upper left-hand corner to save the note, the app freezes. I've never had this issue in the past. It seems like it's been over the past month or so that this has been happening. So I then have to close the the app and when I go back in, it automatically create a duplicate. At that point, the note that I originally made is not there and I have to redo it. Very frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"As other reviews show, the app has ui response issues and ignores device rotation settings. Also, why lock home screen settings to a paid sub? The Get Started widget has 1 tutorial that won't start no matter how many times I click it. Gave up and wanted to remove the section. Nope. Can't customize the home screen (just to remove a widget) unless on a sub. Now I have the Get started widget stuck there. Cleared cache and data to no avail and I'm not signing up for the trial just to fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"good work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good tool for free, payment options are a bit too expensive for small case personal use and I don't see the added benefit other than stopping the annoying weekly popup about ""one-time-discount"" option. Sometimes have issues syncing or even openning up, especially if connection is not strong and makes it frustrating when I just want a quick offline search. Overall I'd recommend it for at least trying it out for free then decide."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"can't do without it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used for years but has become terrible. 1) App does not load Notes with any speed whereas it used to be fast. 2) Notes take a long time (minute to over 10 minutes) to save. 3) Note Data is lost on Save attempts too often to be considered reliable and 4) when a Note does finally save, usually to almost always, creates multiple duplicates of the Note, with 5) each Note has same updates, occasionally a minor change among all of the duplicates. Highest number of duplicates in a single Save is 24."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The App is very good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love being able to use this app whenever and wherever I need to and have the ability to view my notes even when I switch devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Evernote is GREAT! But resource hungry. It performed SLOW and buggy on the Moto G Power. Now on a Samsung S23 Ultra with 8GB RAM and a Snapdragon 8 Octa-core, Evernote runs as fast as it did pre v10 upgrade on the Moto G Power (an inexpensive phone, but in my opinion EN should be designed to run well on a phone like it). Evernote was the only APP with performance issues on the older phone... Not everyone can afford a $1,000 +/- phone... Evernote should post minimum hardware specs for running it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's useful for save any important note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"you keep track of my exes lists. cool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wasn't able to open my first file. ""File unavailable"""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am using this from 2 years it is good but suddenly blocked my data and started asking subscription by paying money yearly.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"makes life stress free and comfort zone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I liked Evernote on my old phone, but on this one it has a completely different style. It's very confusing, slow and buggy. For example I couldn't empty the trash, and often I would get ""note conflict"" (duplication) when the app wouldn't save a note properly. Sometimes it wouldn't save a note at all, which was extremely frustrating! On top of all that, it constantly kept telling me to subscribe. Having to pay for writing a few words sporadically? Dystopian! And for those reasons I'm out. 👋🥲"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wow. Evernote now will force you to upgrade. You can use the basic version anymore. Unistall"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"A perfect app to not miss out any important details.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm rating it five stars even though I'm not using it yet. Intuitively, this would already be helpful in writing notes at hand."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Years ago I had their other app (Evernote the blue one) and delete that one long time ago. I see this one now and reviews note bad. I gave it a try, but it's the same at the old one. They have had the problem with copy and pasting text, likes to pull up texted copied from a month ago frustrating the blue one use to do that too. There are other reason I'm uninstalling again. (In all it's the same app as before with a few tweaks here and there since then. I'm done. I will stay with the app I have!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this is the best app to create note ever you can always backup your notes and furthermore you can save everything you want in your notes I strongly believe that this app is created for parents like me because we need somewhere to put and save everything for our family I am so glad and so content to have this in my hands thank you thank you thank you for creating this app just for me mothers out there you cannot go wrong whether your business woman or not this app is for you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Frustrating. Please don't use EN any more. Loses data, gets stuck, duplicates. After 22 years! Only gimmicky irrelevant updates. Support form only 500 characters - they don't care. You may not notice at first, but when you do, spread the word! Unfortunately, I don't know a good alternative. But that doesn't mean EN is worth it. We need to develop a different organization."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"ideal alternative for physical diary, actually this makes it more comfortable than reaching for the pen and paper. Also, reading old notes is so handy and interesting. I love Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app is processing slowly. It doesn't work offline. It duplicates notes when syncing beween app and web."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"i love this task manager but trying to update billing and upgrade to profesional is virtually impossible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Do not use this app!!! 4 times now I've had to buy the premium version in order to get backups of notes that were randomly erased for no reason. No customer service to retrieve the lost data. The most important thing a note keeping app can do is to retain data. This app has glitches that erases data regularly. I will be switching as soon as I have the time to figure out how to export my data into another program."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Used to be slow to load/scroll etc. with long lists on OnePlus 6T. But now it is fast on s23 Ultra with same lists. Needs to be optimised for older phones. Upgrade prompts are too intrusive at times. It prevents me from using the app until I select to upgrade, or I close/reopen the app. Does the job otherwise."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"helpful data restore and back up"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"why does it auto-rotate???"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love the versatility of Evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've tried so many apps to help keep me organized in school but none have been as precise, orderly or as simple to use as Evernote. It makes keeping track of all schoolwork easy to find, simple to use and I keep raving about it and recommending it at school."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works great for any type of notes easy to search and good interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is a fantastic app, I recommend using it along with Microsoft SwiftKey and using the mic option to turn your mobile into a dictaphone...so good...just shame its no longer free but understand they need to make some money,"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Don't like the new interface, and plus, there's a new drawbacks when searching: You can't go directly to the keyword you intended to look for. So lame, unlike in the past which were much more convenient! Update: Slow, laggy, uncool interface."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome app. specifically when comes to saving you tube small videos for concept clear. Only Thing I would request devloper to insert function of voice command and words from camera."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Every feature is presented like it's usable then locked behind a pay wall. Literally opened the app for the first time & it tried to ""upgrade"" me on everything. This app is more interested in selling you a better version of it then it is in actually working."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"There was a time that i gave this app 5*but now its 1* I used this app since 2017 with a free account and it have me 60mb of free offline storage, now suddenly i cant use it unless i have data, i went to your website and they said they still offer that 60mb but i have synced over and over still says i have used 5kb of my 60mb. I had loved this app so much and i had put so much of my memories already and i was thinking of upgrade but now im no longer confident with you guys, wish i could recover"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has gone to the dark side! Moved all of my saved files and folders to another note app. I'm definitely not going to pay for this! Also, the constant begging for me to pay has caused me to run away from this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Note editing and saving becomes slower and slower over time, and often produces duplicate notes due to the performamce issue. This is outrageous, wasting me a lot of time struggling taking note. Reinstalling the app can allieviate like some hours, and then it becomes slow again. The app didn't have performance issue one year ago. Even for now, the evernote web client and windows client don't have performance issue. The issue is only with the Android app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"V nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good and useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am not even sure how people have been using it till now. It sucks and sooooo slow. The only thing that's fast is the upgrade ad that pops every second"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use the free version. I can access it anytime from 2 devices and enter notes whenever I think of them. It makes it pretty easy to organize thoughts and other notes and record keeping."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used to Love Evernote. It was easy to use and secured but now. It want me to subscribe to plans. It displays the subscribe ad after every 3 seconds 🤦. I have my important documents in there, how do i retrieve them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A convenient way to create notes and links to stuff on the web. Easy to use and very useful when I'm out and about."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"How can we get this app on tablet?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I love this app. I've used it for about a year now and other members of my family have used it for far longer. The only issue that I have is a slight but consistent problem with copying text. If I select the text and press copy, my clipboard will just start recycling other things I have copied in the past (old screenshots and other copied texts). It is a total gamble on if it will actually copy the text or not. And it doesn't work more than it working I don't have this problem on any other app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app froze on the tutorial. If that is what I have to look forward to, no thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I'm truly exhausted. Evernote used to be a fine app since its launch, acting as my primary digital notebook, where I've stored countless notes, poems and essays. But lately, the user experience has been terribly disappointing. Not only does the app lag, but I'm appaled to find my notes deleted for no good reason. Losing one's notes is perhaps the most painful thing a writer can go through. Please look into this and fix what used to be the optimum note-taking tool."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What happen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible App & ridiculous limitations Cant even set a default font size but you must pay to use more than one device? Gross Greedy business"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"6pm I z??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app needs a few things fine tuned but overall great!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Personally, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that using the app on more than 2 devices (which includes desktop) is locked behind a pay wall. I'll find another ecosystem."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"what an App.Fell in love with this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Super app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To much bullcrap and they want to charge for this.... keep is free and better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I got a new phone I moved all notes and download the app. Somehow, this app give me no choice instead of ""upgrade to continue using evernote in this device."" It's free trial and have to pay after a week. What if I dont want to pay the subs after a week? You delete all my notes? 🫣🫣🫣"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very usefull app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A very good app but everything needs to be purchased."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Maybe increase the storage size for free users and cut the laggy experience"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Since it's limited to one device and forced to upgrade. I forced myself to OneNote ✅"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I'm using Evernote since I started writing stories. I used this app to create manuscript and for some educational purposes. Although its having some issues, I still found it useful. Filipino user here!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it. it's great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I can't do without it,I use it daily."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"(Update on 2021 review) Still not keen on display on newer version(window display with horizontal scroll) and miss the older version with brief listings for quick access. Paid for the Personal A/c to enable customisation and at least another advantage of this is the prompt given when sharing to the app to specify which notebook the item should go into."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very helpful! But can you please allow right-to-left writing to allow for arabic text?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: the app seems mostly fixed and I don't have a ton of issues, but trying to scan in documents is a huge issue in which I can only scan 3 or 4 at a time before the app permanently freezes and I have to force close it and start again. Old: The more recent issue is that 95% of the time when I try to edit a note the app just freezes and crashes. Nice. The company also pushes premium upgrades WAY too much. I do like Evernote a lot, but it is becoming increasingly impossible to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was great before the paywall. I don't mind paying for apps however subscriptions are out of the question."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The best Note App ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry but as a paid service it's unacceptable that notes sometimes don't get saved without a clear indicator. I never know when and what gets saved and sometimes it just disappears unrecoverably. If I write something down I have to rely that it stays there, otherwise the whole point of the service is obsolete. I tried to like it but unfortunately this is a no go. I cancelled my subscription and moved my notes. I'm sorry."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good before the paid v."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to work well, however it will often delete my recent edits, even if you click the green tick mark to go back to the main screen and out of a note, when you go to another app and back again, the edits are gone. I cant trust it anymore. This is especially true if network signal isnt good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to love and recommend this app to everyone. Recently it just became a useless nightmare. Notes won't save, get duplicated randomly (but not identically), massive lags. I just got fed up and uninstalled it. Pity as I've lost all my notes but honestly not worth the pain of navigating this overcomplicated garbage anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent for keeping notes and lists and timetables. A great mobile resource."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app. out there."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never just works correctly. Every single time they update this app, the thing they broke last update gets fixed, and they break something new. Every. Single. Time. It's unreal. 2/25/2023 update Apps deleting random bits of notes I've taken. I can actually watch things disappear sometimes. I don't know why I still use this. It has potential to be a completely pleasant experience but somehow is steadily declining in quality."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I like the idea of jotting down notes with added features. Able to synch between devices is convenient enough. 5 star for note taking purpose"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great apps"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"On the desktop having trouble scrolling ! When I shared my notes with my email link doesn't work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"You have only 2 devices to use including the web version which is very strange and the windows desktop app is not even working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"either a yearly cost or a one time purchase shoukd be added"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"A good, free (to a level) quick note making app with editable folders. Had created a lot of useful notes on it including 5 chapters of memoirs. If you have to reset your device though, make sure to read up how to back up Evernote files. I backed up my phone content using my phones copying app. Everything went across except Evernote files. Realised after reset. Lost everything. So my 3 stars reflect bitterness towards Evernote for losing my files and not the app functions, which are good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"an essential app for me for getting things done and organizing my life. only compliant is occasional bugs syncing across devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Long time paying customer and once Evernote evangelist but the app is getting increasingly unstable. Constant note sync errors and duplications. My current plan runs out soon and I won't be renewing and will be migrating to an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wanted to purchase the upgrade to share notes with my Samsung Galaxy and my iPad. Evernote doesn't allow me to use the Samsung pen to write notes. It doesnt work in any capacity with my Samsung pen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good app. I was searching so many apps for my goal setting, daily to do, and notes. evernote satisfies all my requirements in one place. thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"worst"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad security app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A lot of features, specially I like the search option. But I am not a premium subscriber, so I can't talk about premium features. otherwise the normal features ar obviously good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"don't like the push to paid version constantly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Updated review: Unfortunately I am now experiencing the same frustrating issues so many others have complained about; duplicate notes, not syncing files, too many prompts to upgrade, and the format between my phone and tablet (I hate the one on my tablet btw, it's too unorganized) are completely different. I have since started using another note app. I love how the same account can be accessed from one phone to another without losing any saved information when you upgrade your phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible, lost my notes and extremely slow. Sync is useless as well. No way!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like how versatile Evernote is across platforms. I use it almost every day. However, weak points are that it does not work on older Android versions and that the synchronization between devices sometimes goes wrong."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"covered every possibe angle, perfrct"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Literally does not work"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"So so"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Just to sell paid version, it's not allowing access in tablet or laptop 🙄🙄 heights of capitalist mindset"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be a good app.. I used it for years.. But then it requested me to upgrade and I started having a hard time dealing with it... I found better a friendlier alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Constantly crashing. Duplicate notes. Unreliable synchronization of notes. Paying customer for 10 years and very disappointed that the product and customer service have been in decline over last two year. Will not renew subscription next year if the product does not improve. I've lost faith in the reliability of Evernote."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is bad"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Re-installed the app after a long while and the push for the upgraded version of Evernotemakes the free tier hard, if not impossible to use. I have no other devices signed into my account, yet I'm told I've reached a device limit - I'm literally locked out of my own notes...😑"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only reinstalling to delete anything I had in it because its constantly being password sprayed. Hackers are constantly attacking the accounts."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely terrible!!!! Two years after I cancelled my subscription they are still trying to take money out of my account. Customer support is not available. Buyer beware!!! They are stealing from me at this point and I don't know how to make it stop!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"User friendly, safe, easy to backup"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Rock bottom compared to what it used to be. Can no longer perform even the basic save function, content gets deleted. No longer reliable and convenient."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Offline access to notes is PAID feature ? So if I loose data connection I cant see my notes ? C'mon !!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I haven't used the app a lot, but sometimes, one of my notes is being duplicated and it's starting to get annoying when I have to delete them. I don't recall duplicating them either."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Incredibly Awesome Took! Helps Organize My Week. Use It Everyday For Years. 👍👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Using Evernote since 2016. Now I'm leaving it in 2023. Thanks for everything Evernote. ♥️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Basic syncing--even on a single device--is a complete mess. I'm far from alone in experiencing this issue."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Now not checked"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for creating notes for research, field work, household, etc. You can make checklists & attach files. Scan documents within the app using the phone's camera, & Evernote will index their text for searching. Editing & annotating photos is rudimentary. In January 2023 I got a new phone & could finally update to the current v. 10, which is on par with the desktop & web versions as far as features go. The interface is not simple & takes some learning, but is worth it. I find it indispensable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can you please stop the auto rotation feature? or include control option over it. It's annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"pay to use? trash"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've used this app for quite a few years now and it has been my go to note keeper. I have tried others but Evernote has always been the workhorse. However, now that I have an issue (below), I cannot seem to find a way to contact support, except hopefully through this review. Just recently for the first time, I have one inventory file that mysteriously lost some notes. Out of 17 items, numbers 6 - 14 are missing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Esta aplicación era muy buena, pero a partir de que comenzó a cobrar me dificultó guardar mis notas sin previo aviso y sigo sin recuperarlas. Qué horror, tengo información importante y no puedo acceder a ella si no pago, qué robo. Pésima aplicación, no vale la pena."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"would be 5 if not for the constant nagging to upgrade"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I started using this app since 2012, this app used to be gr8. However days past, they (developers) deliberately made the app cumbersome for free users and removed and key features which used to be available for free users. Removing tasks and repeat alarm feature is too much. Never gonna use the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Backward upgrades. Syncing not working. End up with constant conflicts and/or losing important content. Used to love the app. Considering to switch now"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why you guys have suddenly become hungry for money? Constantly giving pop up on free version also. These pop ups make unable to use this app. Absolutely horrible experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As of 2023, the most recent version of Evernote on Android is slow and frequently drops parts of notes I'm writing. I had to downgrade to v8.13.3 to get something reliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Why is this the only app that refuses to respect my screen orientation settings."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app been using it years"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Wow...so beautiful apps🌸i like it💓"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Salam.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm finding Evernote very useful for storing and organising all my bits and pieces. The more I use it the better it gets."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Won't let me continue without upgrading. I am using one device, but it says I must unlink one to continue. The only link that works is the upgrade/pay link. Oh well. Buh bye"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The mobile version is a Horribly slow app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I don't know whether i did a mistake by buying Evernote premium version. I am using Samsung galaxy tab S7, 21fe as my tab and mobile. As laptop i have MacBook Air. Mainly I am depending on Samsung note for note taking and other writings. And Samsung will never play together with Mac. Unfortunately, Mac is not compatible and i started searching for a compitable app to serve my purpose in all my devices. I have searched for an app, i found Evernote.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app to store notes and stuff"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Bagus"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Over the past week, I have received 3 emails saying I sent a request to change my password. I have not used this app in years! I downloaded the app and tried to login with the email address the request was sent, it said the account was not linked with Google and to click the ""forgot password"" link to change my password. I may be paranoid, but I immediately backed out and uninstalled the app. If I get one more email I'm going to report it as spam."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"because i pay money"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Finally! Ohh boyi"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very good app, must have every smartphone"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"more like Google Keep, it's not a simple notepad. Moreover it keeps asking to pay to use it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Approaching unusable. Why does the online sync take priority over a local copy? Makes no sense and causes a lot of frustration from lost text and slow openings."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Like many users, I can't reliably use the Evernote Android app because I can't properly sync my notes. Before, it was lightning fast sync. Now, there are missing items from the sync. I will not proceed with my subscription because of this reason."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It was going great for some years, but recently i had to reset my phone. And now when I try to log in, it doesn't proceed. Please help out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No web based version. Forced to mobile app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"NOTES ARE DISAPPEARING - The new update is just BAD!!!! 6yrs with Evernote, and they've decided they're done with me. I save notes when offline and sync when back online - done this for years ... only recently, upon connecting to WiFi, I lose all my unsynced work. Now I can't rely on it to do a BASIC JOB - SAVE A NOTE OFFLINE."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you want a notes app that processes text as if it's trying to process a 3D model of the entire planet and everything on it (i.e. very slowly) with a very frustrating premium model, this is the app for you! but seriously please take ur notes on something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app was good and fine some changes have made it the most unstable app. It keeps crashing every few seconds. It is extremely frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"La mejor opción en notas"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Saat ini saya sudah tidak bisa lagi menggunakan aplikasi ini karena diharuskan membayar biaya langganan, padahal banyak data penting yang tersimpan disini. Harga yang harus dibayarpun tidak sedikit, mungkin memang sudah saatnya beralih menggunakan aplikasi lain, banyak koq yang gratis tapi dengan fitur yang sama bahkan lebih baik daripada evernote ini !!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great App for me but I had to uninstall it, its now very slow and not stable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I really like the features in this app, but the freezing upon opening, and constant crashing is Very frustrating! If this could be fixed I'd give heaps more stars"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"On a Chromebook, you will get a much better experience installing the ""Evernote Panel"" extension to the Chrome browser. The Evernote Panel also works in an independent window from the browser (like the Andoid app) but gives you an up-to-date feature rich experience, e.g. displays PDF contents instead of only giving you a link for an external app to use. The Android app if of more suitable for phones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using it for years for recipes. Absolutely love it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Here is the main reason I never signed up for a paid version, and am now switching to a different service: the UI. I always find myself looking for basic features that I know must exist, like adding attachments, but are somehow hidden from any intuitive interaction. The redesign from last year made me hopeful that this would be changed, but it actually made it worse. There seems to be no effort made for UX work. Everything is hidden beneath layers of taps and obfuscated buttons."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Unbearably slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not paying for planning app that is not connected to MS office"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Keep freezing n crashing."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"fantastic to make note of the key things that need to be done"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to use Evernote as my go to note taking app. But for some time now, the constant ads popping is really driving me nuts. I've been refraining from reviewing about that but it's been long time coming. I mean I understand the need to get people to sign up but everytime when I'm trying to just do 1 search or type 1 note.. I have to deal with an ad pop up first. Where each ad is worded weirdly to make me ""confirm"" that I'm missing out on a good deal or something. I think Evernote can do better"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"sometimes delays in syncing btw phone and laptop"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's biggest problem is the delay in sync between two devices, If something updated in a note on PC and instantly that note is also updated (even if application or note is closed in PC) in mobile then it'll create 2 copies of it. At least add a button for refresh/sync so that this conflict won't happen,Please, Please"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't log in!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's ok... I think it's just reinventing the wheel. Most androids come with a notepad already, so, why do I need another one?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good improvement. Request to add ""Pause"" and ""Resume Recording"" facilities in Audio notes. Also facility to merge text of scratch Pad with an existing note would make is more useful. All the best"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The constant bombarding of premium requests along with the apparently awful security has me deleting my account and going to another notes app. For anyone else don't put anything personal on this app it's not safe."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusably slow, cluttered interface, conflict error that I couldn't get rid of was the last straw. Simple text files should not give me this much trouble. Embarrassing for the developers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"only downside is when you use it on both computer and phone, files don't integrate well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"v. slow, can't share"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's expensive. but if you are used to a notepad that's synced with your Google account, it's worth it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"When I got my new phone I had to update this app. This used to be a great app. Was simple and worked great. Now it's just pure trash. The widgets are aweful and unresponsive(they got rid of the dark mode. We are now stuck a stupid white). The app UI is now extremely convoluted to the point you can't get anywhere without hitting a ton of buttons😡. Want to actually save your note? Good luck. You have to hit the save check ✔️ like 4 times before it will do anything. I HATE THIS!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"At 17mb, Evernote its a big file to install BUT it does the work of up to 4 other apps, so it not only saves space, but it saves effort too, by not switching between seperate apps AND it integrates seamlessly too. Very versatile indeed. Still using it 2023!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Some of the most basic finctions have been put behind a pay wall. Also, constant spam to upgrade. I used to pay for the service and then switched to obsidian to try that out. The ""free"" experience has left a bad taste in my mouth. Obsidian it is"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very convenient and useful features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Thank you for ruining my old times fav app They reply reviews and they say sorry for that person's experience but the thing is it's not a particular persons experience, the whole app is ruined I don't know what happened in your company but I'm so mad at that person who's responsible for all of this It's look like bad manager issue"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The new 10.x code base has evoked mixed Reactions amongst old time users. It isn't glitch free. It does have problems but I think in the long term, the common database helps solve bugs and add features faster. Home, Tasks and Calendar, Backlinks, are all new features in 10.x, which are starting to bring this app, in the direction, of what it once used to be. Kudos to Ian small, for making this happen."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Now, you want me to pay to get my notes...hahaha! Screw you! Uninstalling this rubbish! Toodaloo!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My notes keep reverting to pre-editing notes and I have to retype, only to find they revert again... Either that or the points suddenly duplicate themselves in the note.... Or a new note with identical header but no content suddenly appears. Evernote used to be 5 star good, but now it's just annoying, unreliable, and not friendly to use anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Harder to learn to use, slow on my phone, clunky"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Keeps signing me out. Routinely doesn't work without an internet connection."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good app for organizing yourself across all electronic platforms. However, the developers struggle with easy glitches."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This used to be the best notepad ever. I love how the formatting matches my organization preferences. However, lately the app has been glitching/stalling when making notes. I'll still use it because it is still the best notepad I have found, but that is why its at 4/5 stars."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As a long-time user I am consistently disappointed that the developers are choosing to remove features from the app in order to push their paid premium service. Most recently, the decision to remove access to notes while offline has been especially annoying and has me looking at other platforms."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Work is very good."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's been a fantastic app until they made accessing your notes offline a paid feature. The app lags with its recent updates and takes too long to save notes. I even lost a note that was saved offline. My experience on the desktop version remains a 5-star one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used evernote a long time ago, since then, I've tried to cancel my account twice only to be met with error messages, ""too many failed attempts"" to log in (i didnt fail to jog in and didnt change my password), to the point where I'm almost convinced I'm not allowed to cancel my account. Don't sign up. Use your phones built in notes feature, the hassle with customer service/the nonsense system to cancel isn't worth it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app. can transfer next from mobile to pc, But it would be good if it have commit save note button on PC too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've tried using this as my main note taking app so many times. But this is a classic case of ""too many features"". There needs to be an ""Evernote Lite"" or a simple mode or something. Most of the times you just want to take quick notes on the move, and then occasionally spend a little time organizing them or using more advanced features. This is just not for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Service is getting slow, takes a few minutes for the app to open lately"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App is worse not better. Slower, constant ads to upgrade. Have used 10+ yrs. Reviews say even with upgrade they still pester you for money. Tried signing in on new phone and they've managed to make even that difficult and aggravating. It will not allow me to continue to my account without me answering personal questions. One phone was offline and literally any and every time I tried to do anything there were pop ups to confirm my email. They don't seem interested in people continuing to use app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Love the app, but the adds are a bit much and aggressive. Other than that, thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used this app for 8 years and I'm extremely upset that they just took away the ability to search the contents of years worth of my notes! If I want that feature, I would have to pay nearly $7.00/month! I can no longer recommend this company, even though I was a huge proponent for so long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice to place my thoughts and lists in one place, but organized and quickly accessible"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A relic from a past that no longer exists. In a world of more simplistic apps that do everything better, why use insecure Evernote?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It's not working fine with me, Neither my reminders coming on time nor due date."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I haven't use this for years. This is the second day I am getting password reset mails. Last time someone tried to get into my account Evernote team was unresponsive and unhelpful. I hope if I download the app I will be able to finally close this account and this nonsense will stop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"really like the diversity of templates and the customization. Highly recommend for organization."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"UPDATE: Really appreciate the developer fixing the screen rotate problem (without me having to reach out lol) Very helpful app, would recommend. PREVIOUS REVIEW: [3 stars] It is pretty great, but I can't use it while lying down because it automatically rotates the screen to landscape, even when I have my phone locked to portrait mode"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"One of the useful applications for storing text documents, image documents and other information. It is very efficient and easily accessible from.any device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They don't have customer support in case you want to contact them if you don't pay for their premium service. Their ""contact us"" page tells you to read the help page or go to the forum and ask other members for help, and that paying members get customer support options. I've been trying to delete my account because it's been compromised multiple times, and they make it a real hassle to remove the contents of your account. I strongly suggest you use a different notepad app if you need one."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not downloading application. Daily im trying to download app but not downloading its what we do"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Yuck, so much hacking/phishing related to this app. I'm over it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is trash. Trying to delete an account is harder than pulling teeth. And the obsessive manner in which they try to make you upgrade your membership is off-putting. Like, what's so special about this app that they have to bully the user at every turn? Trash."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Two slow and lags to open both on web and android"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great for keeping things up to date"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This has been my go-to notes app for many years. Unfortunately, lately (since the 2/6/23 update) it's gotten very slow and will often not display the prev text in an existing note if you go in to edit. This removes it's usefulness for me, and has caused me to lose access to information I thought I had safely documented."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Hello to the Devs or Company. I love Evernote but I have one issue. As a budget person. I really hate that some of the things such as customized home screen, More tasks, etc... Is blocked by payment. It's sad, but It's a way of your app making money. Although I love this app, I sadly have to uninstall it due to the payment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't sign up, button doesn't work. Waste of time."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be great. Then they made a huge change a few months ago and now it's slow beyond measure and super buggy. It freezes while editing notes & loses content I've written. Only fix I've found is to uninstall and reinstall once a month at least. Tech support says they're working on a fix. Until that's out, I can't recommend Evernote. Update 03/23: It's getting worse rather than better. When saving a note, be prepared for six or seven near but not quite identical copies. Awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Annoying. The app frequently bugs you to upgrade and got to the point that it wouldn't let me use the app anymore unless I upgraded. Can't even type more than a few words without it saying I need to upgrade to continue using the app. Much better apps out there for sure. This app just ain't it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After the 50million account data breach, I've been getting ""Change your Password"" emails weekly for years. Do I recommend Evernote? Possibly, but at this stage I'm more pissed off and inclined to say no. I've had to block all Evernote emails entirely in order to cease the spam. Use another note service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app is super slow and inconvenient comparing to the desktop version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great tool to use for all your needs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using Evernote for 10 years. I used to love it, but now every time I need to write something down, I'm prompted to buy premium. By the time I get to make a note, I've usually forgotten what it was I needed to write down. It is every single time. If I didn't want premium yesterday, why would today be different? I have ADHD, if you distract me while I'm trying to write something down, I'll forget it!!! I don't need the premium features. Stop spamming me!!!"

I'm not a genius with technical stuff, but I'm no idiot either. I've tried to suss out what has happened to no avail. I am NOT a happy bunny. There is a free option for the use of this app but they constantly hassle you to upgrade; very annoying!!! I contacted them for help but got referred to 'the group' ie other users for help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Too many ads to buy premium, otherwise good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Quick note and new full note widgets don't work half the time, especially if you have no internet connection, what kind of note app would fail at this simple feature? So infuriating. It used to work in the past, app's massively gone downhill over the years. EDIT: Emailing does nothing, just get a template answer that they're working on the duplicate note sync issues, got no help at all for the new note saving bug."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Using the free version on Android - it used to be good but then a year or more ago started to not sync properly with my laptop and now has a habit of being so slow it saves up to 5 versions of the note so I have to waste time checking and deleting off the mis-saves."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great portability"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I first installed it in 2013. It was a great app then--simple, no nonsense. But a few years ago they started messing with it, trying to turn the app into something else, Each update has added more features that detract rather than improve functionality. The sync function is less functional, and it creates duplicate Notes despite their being no changes. The last few years, I have used the app less and less. With the huge price increase just announced, I canceled and uninstalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"To top management As user of Evernote for so many years and is all along no cost implement and now that you keep popping all the advertisement and force all users to sign up.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app..Doesnt load.I uninstalled it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to really like it, but the app seems somewhat poorly organized now just to entice you to pay to adjust the home page or sync more than 2 devices, or do many other random mundane things for $50/yr.. and even if you do there are apparently still ads, wild. I'd consider subscribing for a reasonable fee (let's say $10-20/yr maybe and removing all ads) just to get away from the big tech giants if it were encrypted/private.. but atm it's just an inferior OneNote that pesters you for money."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I installed Evernote and paid a subscription. I uninstalled the app and cancelled my subscription within 10 minutes because it didn't suit my purpose but was informed that I would not be getting a refund. I paid $74.00 for 10 minutes use. NOT HAPPY!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote customer since 2011. I like it except they constantly prick me with stupid stuff. 8-10x a day they make duplicate notes that are no longer able to be used and have to be deleted. When I even close the note out and clear memory it still happens. Android and iPhone. The last six sets of phones. Lgg8. OnePlus 9pro. IPhone 7. Etc. Two different ios and multiple phones. Professional. Personal & Free. Doesn't matter. I will unsubscribe on my August 15 yearly anniversary subscription date."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It works. What more do you want?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Still the Best Note App out there, BUT, the default scanner really sucks. On iphone, Evernote has the Evernote Built Scannable app. It automatically imports scanned documents into Evernote. With Android we're stuck with the Evernote built in scanner. Scanned images are often blurry and out of focus. It's been this way for many, many years. From LG to ZTE to Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. It's the app, not the phones causing this. I recommend another app like Adobe Scan."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I've used Evernote for almost 10 years now. It's had it's ups and downs. Currently, I think it's on an upswing. It has a lot of great features and *mostly* works smoothly and quickly. Further speed, stability, and smoothness updates are needed to get that fifth star."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Cut and paste function only works sporadically. Very irritating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using Evernote for nearly a decade and I'm seriously considering switching to another platform for my note taking. I've been asking for years for a simple addition of a global change of font and the spell checking capabilities are beyond abysmal. Web clipping is unintuitive and sluggish, it picks random locations to save. Evernote on Android is painfully slow. It creates duplicates of notes for no reason. And stop making updates for tasks that no one would use on such a slow software."

I went a few years without needing the app and just recently DL the free version. I've seen a lot of bad ratings that had me thinking ""why waste my time"". But I have to say, In my opinion, it's still a good as it ever was. I have no problems with it what so ever and would definitely recommend to others. It just goes to show you that you can't take every rating to heart. Try it for yourself first. ✌️"

It wasn't doing this b4 but resent updates..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I'm surprised by the low ratings, it works well in my devices even in the low-end one. Okay, it has many features that are only available for paying users, but even the free service is good enough. Thank you, developer!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote was the clear transition from OneNote. Evernote search Filters are A1 compared to OneNote. Widgets don't have enough functionality Yet to be useful in my applications, I'lI look to later rollouts for that. I like how Task and Note (keyed objects) are handled in the program or how the database structure is setup. Which pairs well in providing robust Task/Note management functionality. fluid performance across platforms and sync issues are non-existent."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So, having become completely annoyed by a slow, buggy app with an unusable interface, I had installed an older version that I liked, and which actually worked. So what does Evernote then do? They FORCE an update, despite me explicitly DISABLING updates to this app in the Store settings! Typically arrogant behaviour I've come to expect from Evernote. NO respect for their paying customers. If the same thing happens on my PC, I'M DONE. Sick to death of this treatment."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app. Easy to use. Only downside is the occasional push for you to buy the pro version."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It was a great app, but it's been duplicating my notes. I don't use the app all that much, and paying $50 a YEAR is asking way too much. I've used Evernote for 13 years, so that would be $650 for something I use a few times a year! Lately, the constant notices to upgrade have gotten irritating with their frequency. Forget it! Even at their half price sale, it's not worth paying every year. I'm leaving Evernote. Too bad they don't have a one time price for people who don't use it much."

So I'm down to Windows app & might quit paying for Evernote (back to free) & switch to something if functionality doesn't return.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"• App freezes for ~20 seconds every time I open a note.
• Constantly mangles text. Words jump around to different lines or sometimes completely disappear.
• No folders, instead relying on tags and notebooks, so there's no client/job/work/personal separation. I DON'T WANT WORK NOTES MIXED UP WITH PERSONAL NOTES.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolutely love this app for saving and sharing recipes!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Initially compared Springpad and Evernote apps and chose to use Springpad due to simplicity and ease of use. When Springpad went away, I found Evernote had improved and I have been a daily user since and Springpad shut down in 2014. I can't live without searchable notebooks/journals today and I am able to find my information easily and quickly on all platforms...android phone, iphone, pc, mac...even on my Nook device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I can't live without this app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app for years, but last time I wrote few notes offline and when I went online, the offline notes has been deleted. How should I trust this app anymore?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Cant access my notes anymore due to now asking for a membership fee.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Despite a few glitches, I used Evernote for many years. However when I lost the text in a note and it synced before I could hit the undo button, I lost irreplaceable information. On iOS apparently I could have shaken the phone but Heaven forbid be on Android and you're just screwed unless you pay for their premium package to be able to view note history. They'll keep all your deleted notes for years though!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"perrrfectooo"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good job"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to love Evernote. Then it got scummy. Sending me promotional notifications that I can't disable in the app, every single time I open the app trying to get me to upgrade my plan, requiring multiple clicks to dismiss because ""this is a limited time offer"" - obviously that's a lie, you make the same offer every month. Goodbye, Evernote - I hope Notion continues to eat your lunch. Get your act together and quit acting so spammy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using it for years as a paying user, but the relentless pop-ups to upgrade to the next level have caused me to no longer enjoy this app at all. If you use on 4 devices in a day, you might get 2 or 3 pop-ups per device, per day. And I'm already a paying user!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Really useful app but is unusable most of the time. It's very slow and crashes everytime I use it. Have to close and open the app several times. Often get fed up so use different apps instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not the best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great, easy to use and speach to text works well enough for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"App deleted my notes on its own. I was reading something I wrote yesterday when suddenly the screen said ""view only"" and the next thing was the note was no longer there. I looked in the trash and there's nothing. This is appalling!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"As ever works well bit why subscribe when very effective free notes system are available ?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Free version has become unbearable. Every time you open the app to make a quick note it gives you a blocking popup with a ""limited time offer"". Which takes 2 or 3 clicks to go away. Now they also started sending random push notifications with offers. I'm out."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Completely useless in Evernote Android Mobile app. After adding points to notes, it is not getting saved as tick mark in top left side gets stuck up everytime as it (tick mark) doesn't respond post adding content into it. Happens only in Android. Kindly fix it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"For me, it's a great app for personal daily use... And i recently downloaded it onto my android device since i discovered it on my pc and wanted to use an app that is available for pc and Android and syncs my notes everywhere. Basically, a free plan of Evernote is enough for my use. And being a free user i like it..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love it. helps me organise content and express my thoughts. thanks Evernote"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I really enjoy Evernote. It takes a while to learn the work around. It is a bit more sure and challenging but there are ways to keep things easy if you understand"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but HATE it now. Evenote is automatically making duplicate copies of the same note while I'm typing. I end up with 10 copies of the same note!🤬 I have used this app for years and didn't have problems until I switched to windows 11. According to forums many people have the same problem which hasn't yet been solved. It is a problem with synchronizing notes between different devices. I can't reach customer support! So frustrating!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I was active user of Evernote since 2017 and it was great, but since spring 2022 it became impossible to use Evernote on Android. First I thought it is because of my smartphone, but it was on my pad the same. Extremely long lasting note saves, crashes and more. Had to look for another app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Ottimo. 2 stelle in meno perché non si riesce a fare il login in Android 13"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app is very useful and I like it a lot, what I don't understand is why does it automatically double space every note you make and there's no way to fix that? Thank you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app i like to note suys"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's pretty good. I've lost my information before though."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent for organizing notes of any kind. I use it for planning future trips. Allows me to add images of areas we may want to visit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great and convenient way to organise all your notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely the WORST note taking app there is. Slow as molasses. Constant bombardment of ads & pushes for upgrades to ppu models. All fronted by a 5th grade design layout. Try others, any others, before getting sucked into this vortex of time wasting."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ive been using for years, different devices. I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"While saving image it's show failed to save note please solve the problem"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"osw"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ridiculous I have used this app for over 10 years and loved it! Now not so much money for professional account was taken out of my bank account. I haven't been able to access my features none at all this whole month! I have been in contact with support since Jan 18th and just keep getting the run around. Awful support!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So many improvements! My love-hate of Evernote is growing into pure LOVE ❣️"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so far so good😂😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized. I've used it for years."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am disappointed. The home page looks great BUT unless you trying to pay for a premium membership for things you don't want you cannot change the home page.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome application. Been using it for 6 years and no complaints whatsoever 👌"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect for daily use!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent for notemaking."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love this app for taking notes from discourses or even just jotting down something I want to remember. I have been using it for several years and don't recall any glitches. The feature I love most is that I can search a word to take me back to any note I'm trying to find."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Didn't really use it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app used to be good... Totally butchered by so-called experts... Slow to load... Loses notes... Interested in your subscription only... Stay away..!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"best ever app I have used so far."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I can't believe this app sucks even after taking my money. It has two subscription plans, personal and professional and somehow you don't have the basic feature of fully customising your home screen in the personal plan! I cannot hide notes. The my tasks check list is more tedious than i thought it would be. There are slim to no features for journaling. Unintutive and abhorrent experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"so good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very good. Enjoying a lot ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good app, useful for text notes even without a subscription, but heavy users can definitely benefit of the subscription. Lost one star because the subscription banners are a bit annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great App. I use it every day."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Simple and efficient tool for taking notes and maintaining tasks. I'm using it for 5 Years"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used Evernote for several years. It works well to keep business notes and personal notes, recipes, craft projects, and reminders in one place."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Major saving issues in the Android app. I have to constantly double, triple or quadruple check that what I write gets saved as the app gets stuck trying to save and often it claims to have saved date but hasn't. Because of the constant data losses I'm actively seeking to replace the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Op"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very Good App Would be willing to have a licenced version of Evernote app for perpetual purpose!!!!!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dev"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I really liked ever note and only need it for one platform, my phone. I constantly get adds to upgrade to paid version now, which I honestly do not need. It's really frustrating and making me want to switch to another app altogether."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This was a great app until a few months ago when I started having problems syncing. Today the sync errors are very blatant. I cannot even get my changes uniform across 2 devices. I am BEGGING the developers to fix this."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"there is a problem with clipping articles on mobile, too slow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Extremely effective and efficient app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"keeps me organized"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Please stop giving me a popup about unlocking advanced document search when I paste text after I haven't pasted in a while or after I restarted the app. I don't like nagware. Also sometimes it creates note conflicts when I'm just using my phone. Why? I understand note conflicts when I'm editing a note on both my phone and my PC, but not when I'm just using my phone. There should be no conflicts in that case."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Muy pesaos con la oferta premium"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've been using Evernote for the past 3 years and tbh is the best app to organize my notes. By upgrading to a professional account I have all I need."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Deleter the app as it simply won't load any of my notes. I couldn't do anything"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"the adds and promotions are so annoying, it has been freezing like crazy whenever I try to edit a note, the adds keeps jumping out and disturbing me typing the note.. I'll have to change to another app"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Woe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is getting better by each passing day. It still has some issues (such as creating duplicates, clipping, etc.) but I hope it will be resolved soon. Despite everything I will give it five stars. My last rating (2 years ago) was one star. Now it's five stars. 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The app is good. I have been using this since 2016 but currently I am facing one issue that I have paid for it but subscription not getting updated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best application for taking notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolute must have app for all your note taking needs. Very easy and comprehensive."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Does what it should do, but often hangs on sync. Also, pressing the checkmark twice yields in a conflict of two identical notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My number one Secure app sharing info between devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good notebook app for taking notes but lack some of sub-folder / child notes feature. Also if some of great feature can be add as free plan it would be freat."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i have been using this free flawlessly for many years now on two devices my phone and laptop. really recommend this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"need to be able to print"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app just gets worse and worse. It's basically beta software. When you want to make a new note on your phone, it searches for updates, locks you out of your note, loses your work or creates conflicting copies. The Android version only really works without glitches is on airplane mode. The PC version gets weekly updates without any improvements in functionality or user experience."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Everything is paid"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote for over 10 years. it remains irreplaceable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very useful for storing important notes. It would be nice if we can add photos also."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Frustrating (not saving notes and constantly duplicating notes) I already transition to Notion. Not worth it especially for important notes that I have to rethink and retype. Been using this for years and now it's frustrating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This new app has some issues. The Evernote I used on my previous phone was as stable as daylight. Never crashed for once, the sync was perfect and always worked. On this new app however, notes don't save, they don't sync with internet connection, and the app crashes when open notes or in the middle of typing. Please, fix this ASAP. I really need an app like Evernote for my job."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"7 yrs in - I count on this product in most every aspect of day to day life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I loved this app but I keeps throwing up error messages whilst streaming TV multiple times, incredibly annoying. BUT worst I have had my account accessed (hacked) from Eastern Europe and Norway twice now in spite of having a very secure and unique password!!!!! I have now deleted this app across all devices, a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Wastes time, so I'm on my web note-taking Evernote and I am trying to customise my homepage but after I'm done they tell me that it should be paid eventhough I wasn't told such thing when I started, I spent all this time adjusting the home just to be told that I can't apply my changes, such things tell me all I need to know about what kind of app this is. A cash grab."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Been using Evernote from many years now, and having a absolutely brilliant experience. Has to be the best note taking app ever. The feature of adding templates is great too."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be a great note app for years. Now in the middle of typing it will literally leave what you're doing by an annoying upgrade popup. I don't need the damn upgrade. I've deleted my evernote account, uninstalled this app and i now moved to Samsung Notes :)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful for storing recipes. Helps me stay organized with different notebooks, tags, and everything is searchable. Good options for lists, like check boxes and numbered."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"SEVERE SECURITY FLAWS! Do not download Evernote. Their security is a joke. Everyone around the world will have access to your account. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The free version is basically unuseable - so it pointless trying this unless you are sure you're going to upgrade. Probably a very cool app if you have the paod version but scoring low here as a free app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too expensive & they will always want more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I still can't get my head around the fact that the most popular clipping app is such a mess at clipping. See it by yourself. Simply try to parse a YouTube link using both, the Chrome extension and this Android aberration, and then compare the results. For instance, the Android app doesn't include the description on YouTube videos, and doesn't offer any auto-format for parsed websites. On the bright side, now we have plenty of better alternatives for clipping —like Notion or even Google Keep."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to login mobile app help me out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's a nice app, but quite unfunctional if you downloaded it for the multi purpose reasons. It doesn't sync right to other devices, it's also not meant to be used with a styles, only keyboard. You also get bombarded with features you can't use without premium (which is very pricy, especially as a university student. Also can't use it offline which defeats the point of notetaking in class. I like the idea of this app, but it's too overpriced and not that tablet friendly."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"EXCELLENT"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"a must have app for so many taskd"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using it for years. This is the best app on my phone."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Guys it's very unsafe for bank account,even after unsubscribed it's deducted my amount since 5 months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app! Thank you!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"amazing app especially for students"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I recently purchased Evernote Professional and it worked for 15 days and suddenly now Evernote is asking me to upgrade my account. I do contacted your support and they says you are on free account. I do have my google play receipt and how can you claim that I am on free subscription?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great tool..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app to keep up with your work I don't really gives ratings so I'm not sure how to but you should try it out"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"After every app update, I have to generate new passcode for this app. My apps gets auto updated via playstore, anyone can get access to my private notes by simply updating this app. Please fix it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Still the best notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Evernote used to be one of my favourite apps. One of the first things I downloaded to a new device. The problem is that it has become so desperate for monetisation that it is hostile to use. Constant pop ups while writing or editing. I get it. You want us to subscribe. But I don't have to be asked every time I open the app. I will probably be migrating away in the next few months."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Once was the app that I like, but now it's so annoying cause it keeps nagging me to purchase the upgrade version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I switched from Notion to Evernote. I was sick with the overall graphic and feel of Notion. It was good, until I ran into problems. I like Evernote because it gave me more choices when it comes to layouting and organising my notes. Which is a kind of a big thing to me as a student. But what I hate is when I add a new task, it takes forever for it to save. And when I go to other pages, and revisit the weekly task list page, the new input is lost. You can't even edit the page while its loading. 😭"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"So bloated that i switched to Joplin. Used Evernote for years. Became increasingly unstable, slow, bloated, after losing my work on a note one too many times, i switched to Joplin. Been using it for a couple of months now, haven't looked back"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nothing much to say, I just love it. y'all make sure to get this app 😎 🦅"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Absolutely Rubbish now. I used to use this app daily and then about two years ago they began pushing ads for members every time you opened the app with fake deals offering 50% off (I say fake as there were all offering 50% off from the start) the app has become slow. And now they want me to pay so I can use the personal note keeping which I have used for years. It won't let me access my notes without joining a free trial. Such a shame I loved this app for so long."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"List STILL SUCK! No delete/undelete all, remove all checked, sort by name, time created, time modified up/down, show checked, etc... Not sure why they think the one thing people use the most in life is the one thing they won't be good at. Uninstaller now, will try again in a year or two... 😮‍💨"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Iko tops"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it is a very useful app I enjoy and use it in my daily life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for years but I'm searching for an alternative now. The ads urging you to upgrade are constant and hard to back out of, and the functionality is worse by the month. It's a shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Long story short: the app gets loads of new features to justify the premium model, whereas the basic features such as sync never get fixed. The most annoying is constant duplication of notes. It is borderline unusable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Horrible interface"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"wonderful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unable to sign in after a logout so much irritating. Not able to acces my important docs. that is how u guys are going make our thing secure. Will not suggest to other if things are going to be like this"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"HOW ABOUT NOT STICKING A STUPID AD IN MY FACE EVERY SINGLE TIME I OPEN THE APP AND TRY TO READ A NOTE?????? IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK????????"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to have Evernote in 2016-18 and used it alot and mostly saved my notes there only. Later shifted to google keeps but it's so unfortunate that I can't access my notes even. If i don't pay now."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love this app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"only difference i would like to see is the calendar function i would like to see options for monthly views. I hate just have a daily view. I need to be able to see the monthly view to schedule."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It Erased a Note I was working on. I've NEVER had Google or OneNote not save a doc I was working on. I've been using evernote more lately and figured I'd up my subscription if it worked better than other things I've been using. Just now however I looked up while writing ideas down and it said something like, can't update server and then WIPED the entire contents of the note. It still displayed the contents in the summary with the note titles?! What? Can't trust this with ideas if it does this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"It's a pretty decent note taking app. there are a couple things I don't like about it, though. I've had a couple times where I've deleted the text of a note on accident, and the undo button doesn't actually do anything for me in bringing it back. It's a little bit heavy in terms of ads. trying to get you to sign up for premium, but you can get the basic functionality of a note taking app without paying for premium. searching works okay. Sometime typing and highlighting are treated weird."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not safe. Kept receiving warning mails like someone tried to access my account from some random country. Changed password, followed all security suggestions, but problem still persists. Had to delete all notes and deactivate account."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used to this app for almost 4 to 5 years now it was working perfectly until recently. When I write a note offline, it doesn't sync when I'm back online. It just gets totally lost. I've lost important information due to this. Please do something about it, I plead. 🙏🏽"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've used evernote since 2013, but I'm uninstalling cuz I can't stand this new version. I needed to access a note quickly, so I click on the app and the first thing I get is a full page ad to upgrade to pro version. I had to click on the X three times before the ad closed. Then, instead of opening into the notes list like it used to, it took me to the new home screen. It's not worth the hassle just for a notes app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app has been OVERCHARGING ME FOR TWO YEARS. I asked in 2020 to cancel my acct and refund that month. They nicely did so. Then I became ill and didn't notice they started charging me AGAIN. Two mos ago I re-downloaded the app and saw that they were STILL CHARGING ME. I tried to access the ""billing"" tab under settings and all it did was SPIN. I wrote the company and said PLS, STOP!! Only to be told ""YOU have to do it under the billing tab. I expl that DIDN'T wk. But they're STILL doing it!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the new update this application does not open to Login. This is very depressing that the app isnt working and that also after update. Team Evernote should look into this concern."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Maybe get spyware on windows if using. Remove auto format is stupid function. Please use colornotes sync with google account is the best choosing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I've used it for years!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lousy payment interface. The screen shows an option to renew at 50% off but nothing happens when you click the button! It only allows you to pay at the ridiculous high price...switching out of this buggy app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very nice note 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience, Forcefully asking to upgrade plan, we dont want to update and spend on notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app. Better than MS OneNote and the rest!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Evernote use to be the gold standard. Now it is too cumbersome, attempts to force to display unnessary panes, panels that fill the display and renders the app hard to display your information. I purchased the PLUS subscription over 10 years ago. Now if I want to get rid of all the unnecessary panels, they tell me I have to upgrade and pay more. Old versions:So easy to keep your notes synchronized between phones, tablets, laptops and computers."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The desktop version is functional, powerful and useful. The mobile version is a whole another story, the mobile application lags all the time, does not load notes properly (I have a todo list with 45 items, which works flawlessly on desktop but the mobile app struggles to load it and loads only 10 or 17 items). It's really a disappointing experience, if you want to use a note organizer that works on your mobile phone, look somewhere else. If you want one that works on PC, get the desktop version"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"No customer care contact, no support, can't even upgrade! Wasted so much time just trying to find out how to reach their customer support to get some actual 'support'! But still couldn't find anyway to connect with them. That too, when I'm trying to actually make a payment for a subscription and have some issue related to that. No thanks!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"the ads and promotions are absolutely infuriating. a notes app is where I go to write down my thoughts, and to have popups in my personal space like that felt like a deep violation. even when i purchased the paid subscription briefly, there were still more ads advertising the more expensive version. the features of the app are nice, but not so revolutionary as to warrant the annoyance. I would simply pay once for a good and hassle-free app, but the way this model works is impossible to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app to keep my notes on, highly recommended!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A great journey, many thanks 😊"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Only 2 device limitations and no offline mode. No longer like this app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I am having an issue with signing in with my email account after reinstallation of my evernote app. It shows me no connecting to the Internet. Pls fix this up, it's been two weeks now and I have a lot of data saved in the app. I can't afford losing them now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Most useful and secure App."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote keeps getting regular updates and makes it a joy to use. Best note taking app!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Can you remove the 2 device thing please? My other phone doesn't work anymore so now I can only have it on 1 working device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It has almost none of the features of the phone appThere's no home screenAnd the only thing you can do is write a noteOr make a list It's ridiculous"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Works perfectly 0 prpblems to report"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I would give this a higher rating if it had more features to use. It seems like a nice, productive app when you first download it, then you realize there are so many other features you have to pay for. Would download another app instead."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Handy note app with a variety of note taking methods. Still learning how tobuse everything, but it's a great app so far!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I DON'T WANT TO SUBSCRIBE"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use this for any document, note or idea I want to save, you can save as a photo, note or extract the text. Very useful and you can add tabs to categorise notes. There's even a scratch pad for initial ideas. Useful for business and home/personal notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I created an important note when I was offline.. and now I cant find it, the note is gone. I cant even get any support for that, because i was using it free. Such a dissapoinment!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This app keeps me organized. It has a ton of features that are very helpful. It completely simplifies my day today tasks. I totally recommend evernote!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"odlična aplikacija"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever notes is automatically closing ,crashing if I am opening camera in a note to take picture. I tried to uninstall & reinstall app & reboot my mobile many times but it's not working. I am using latest version of Evernote app ( 10.46 ) on my android mobile with MIUI Global 13.0.2 stable OS. Please resolve this issue ."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't login to my account since I got a new phone I have had great experience using Evernote but this experience is not really satisfying I tried uninstalling and download the latest update but the problem persisted"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Perfect app for what it's used for. It just keeps saying I don't have permission to use the microphone for text to speech and that could save me a lot of time right now. Someone please send me advice to fix the permissions?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Used to be great, but buggy and spammy now. I mainly use Evernote for shopping lists and other checklists- for the past several months I've had issues with items randomly disappearing off my lists as soon as I add them. They also push the paid version much harder now, which is obnoxious- every time you open the app is excessive. In-app ads are fine but the full-screen ads you have to confirm before it will let you close are annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is probably a year or so, I don't know by which update that this app went from totally great and fast to a disaster in design and experience. I went to evernote becsuse Google Keep started to take ages to save a note. Evernote now takes a mile more for a note to be saved, unresponsive while saving. True Disaster, bring back the old design please. Can you just simply revert all the changes?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"absolutely essential tool especially if you have memory problems"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I should have started using this give years ago. it's simple, logical and made for people like me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unusable, full on bugs and glitches, even on a flagship phone. They never get fixed. Even years later. And then almost every time you open it it spams you with adverts to pay for premium. A mystery to me why this is so popular. I switched to something else as it constantly crashed. Tried coming back and the cursor jumps whenever you try and edit a paragraph. Almost bad enough to make me go back to pen and paper."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Generally good, but 4 X 2 ""fast-action menu"" widget goes blank after a phone restart necessitating a removal and reinstall of the widget - annoying!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is a smooth user friendly application that is useful for quick idea jotting and note srorage."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome 👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app keeps getting worse. I've been using it for many years and lately it just keeps getting slower and buggier. Notes are slow to load, navigation between the notes is slow, things are consistently not getting saved and duplicate notes are being created. I appreciate being able to use something like this for free, but it's getting to the point where I'm looking to switch to something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App takes a long time to load. Notes don't save or only partly save. Notes duplicate themselves sometimes multiple times. It used to be a good app but not anymore. Will need to find a new app and manually copy all my existing notes over"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It needs a learning curve, butvery useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"App is decent but ... they neglect to mention the fact that unless you spend 💵 then you cannot retrieve any of your notes!!! Which would be something to note before downloading."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Echoing some of the other reviews. Long-time user, but recently the app has become so glitchy that it's basically unusable (crashes constantly). Considering cancelling my premium subscription over this, hopefully the bugs will be fixed soon."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Great app use it all the time but it's been constantly making duplicate notes lately for some reason"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used Evernote for years, but now it is a regular occurrence that it duplicates files. Replies to review state it is a new thing, but it's happened off and on for years. Maybe EV should stop spending their energy putting up ads to pay for the ""pro"" Evernote and fix the issue. No one want to pay for a product that has glitches like that."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I've been using Evernote for over 7 years and have recommended it to colleagues and friends who are currently using it because it's been amazing. However, for the past few days I've been loosing notes I take down offline. Sadly Evernote don't save notes offline anymore. When you are from my part of the world you'd know internet services is expensive so it's expensive to leave your mobile data turned on 24/7 . If the offline saving feature isn't returned in the next update I'm switching apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent, usefull and easy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I'm unable to open it from the web sometimes otherwise it's great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Such a shame that the note taking app I've been using for many years is now basically unusable. To type out a long to do list multiple times for it only to delete itself is the opposite of productivity. Multiple duplications, deletes text and takes ages to save when it does work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"What happened to auto scanning things that I'm holding instead of taking a whole picture of the background and everything? The new way of taking photos is annoying...😐"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The new update has made the app nearly impossible to use. Update: it is now impossible to use on this phone. The only one that works is the old version that I have on another phone. Shuts down when I try to edit a note, takes a long time to open notebooks and unnecessarily complicated when I try to view."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This new layout stopped me from using it. Also, the constant reminder to pay subscription."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Worst app! Lots of difficulties in buying it's subscription. Very disappointed 😤"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"my personal 'Google' and information database of everything I've learned or jotted down!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Come on! I am taking notes and there is this pop up notice that I need to upgrade to premium or try the 7 days trial free! There is no option to get back to the app and it force me to log out! Hey, I have been using this app for 6 years straight for free! Why force me to upgrade? I tried to log in again but it just keeps on loading! Nothings happening. Argh! Once I have log in again, I will transfer all my files to other app and delete this again. This is sick!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Very good, but too much feature creep for many of us."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Too lag in user inteference. While zooming the content"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"works pretty good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote since 2017 but lately it makes me think that I have to relocate my notes already. It has been crashing a lot. Most of the time, I have to check again and again if my recent notes are saved, because there are times that they're not. I also view my notes offline. Both in Apple and Android devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The worst app ever dont use this"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good for keeping notes but it gets old having the app beg for cash everytime you try to use it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It is great and I already love this application because it can help you with your phone to become a great one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Right now, it is the worst note app to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It keeps rotating the screen when I rotate my phone and I don't want it to rotate! It's so annoying and there's nothing in the settings to stop it from rotating. Fix it please, it doesn't make sense. I should be able to rotate it whenever I want to, I shouldn't be forced to work with this app in a certain way!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote has been a life saver for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love how easy it is to use and how I can have multiple notes. It is super easy to find older notes as well."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have been a paying Evernote member for 12 years and the past few years the app has gotten worse, most often it can't even save the most simplest of notes, the app has changed, in the past you could save a note immediately even if you weren't connected to Internet and it would sync later but you could still write a note, now even if you write a sentance it doesn't let you exit the note until it has synced and sometimes this can take minutes and when you need to leave the app you loose the note!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"- Very Expensive subscription plan - Paywall + Most complete features"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Someone keeps trying to hack my account so I had to deactivate it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Ever since the update, it has become terribly glitchy and there are so many user errors"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Am not able to share to Evernote from my firefox mobile browser. Sharing to Evernote is not enabled by default after installation as mentioned. Kindly help me sort this. It's working now and am able to make full use of Evernote in my android. Appreciate it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Sick!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is not secure, found so many security attacks on this app. Every time I got notification 'you account signed from America, chinna..' Secure this app immediately."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good Application..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Bad. I purchased anew phone and was unable to get my info unless upgraded. Everything I did seemed to be a challenge."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Make it the better one"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Easy to find info I can't remember!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Disconnects from other devices. You can only use it on your phone or laptop. Can't delete nor emty trash either. One of the most insecure apps for personal notes. Zero data privacy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'm not happy with the use of Evernote, it's so painful after documenting a lot of important thing on your note and turn on my data I don't find them again. All because I'm not online. This is seriously discouragement me to continue with Evernote because of the fear of losing important things."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"A good notes app. Lightweight, all the features I need, does not take too much space."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Manchmal gibt es Synchronisationsprobleme (gratis Version), aber ansonsten sehr gut!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ANDROID APP IS NOT GOOD... Won't save my notes on phone(paid for it,) Update: still won't save my notes on my android phone. 11-2-2022...still not working right on my android... UPDATE 1-6-2023 Still not Good...won't be renewing subscription..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it. All my important info everywhere!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Please, I have been trying to download Evernote on my Cmedia tablet but not downloading. Couldn't is the response"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Not practical, drained my phone battery drastically.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Very bad experience Me 3 year se is application ko use kar rha hu koi problem nhi aati thi lakin ab jab se layout change hua hai changes huye hai recently uski wajah se itna application stuck hoti hai na hi note sync Hote hai na hi notes bana sakte hai every time app chalti hi nahi hai. Na koi functions work karte hai karte kuch or hai ho kuch or jata hai"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love that I can leave a note for myself and not worry I will delete it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been actively using Evernote since 2017 and it used to be amazing. I don't get it how can it get slower and buggier year after year."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app was great on Android until the last month with the new updates. 1. It takes 2 minutes for the app to open. 2. It crashes and sometimes doesn't save my note when I lightly swipe my screen. 3. When I open a note, it opens in view only mode and doesn't allow me to edit. I have to close and re-open and refresh a few times to use it. I have had to use another app so I can quickly jot down notes. Considering using Onenote if this issue isn't fixed. At least it saves my work."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note app out there. No doubt."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app for managing daily task lists for my businesses."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update. getting worse. Still expensive for a note taking app for casual users. The recent changes in the app locking faithful users down to 2 devices forcing you to log out and unable to view anywhere else unless you pay is ridiculous. I have 3 devices. Unable to use offline unless you pay. My work account has it all, sure. The pricing is grotesque for a note taking app. I'm disappointed by the company. +They made the app auto rotate no way to disable. Steps backwards."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Needs support for stylus and outlook otherwise love the app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"some times it shows some error or lag"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"How can such a simple app have so many bugs. Uninstalling and finding a new app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Veryyyy sloooowwww super frustrating!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I use Evernote for just about everything. Be it across my phone, tablet, or computer!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"There are challenges with almost every app but so far this app has been good aside little challenges"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Like many have reported already, your latest version keeps duplicating my files."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have used Evernote for years but recently I've noticed that notes have stopped automatically saving while writing. Notes used to automatically save even without pressing the green tick but in the last few weeks, even if I press the green tick, the note will disappear after I close the app and reopen again. Very frustrating when taking notes from a one hour lecture and they disappear. Also too many pushes for premium (it is constant)."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Longtime user, now looking for alternative. Images do not transfer since last update. There have been ongoing issues, but this may be the final straw for me. It's a shame. It has been very useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ok"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have been using Evernote for 5ish years. I was very happy with it! I use it everyday for work and personal tasks. I switched phones over the weekend and so I have an updated app now and now I am experiencing the duplicating notes issue. That's why I came to read reviews - to see if it was just me! (When I edit a note, which I do multiple times a day for work, Evernote makes a duplicate of that note) I am hoping they fix this problem soon. What a pain it would be to switch everything over."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"gotcha"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Odd quirks here and there. Would likely pay for a basic plus version, not sure why they don't have some options. Their offer seems about 4x what I'd want to pay for notes. Rather than having the middle ground offering they seem to be adding ""nag you"" into payment ads."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"can't log in device trying since hours"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't delete notes, not user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"My go-to for notes, dependable and easy to use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great note taking app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Every time you paste something into a note, and sometimes even randomly, an ad will pop up begging you to pay for pro. ""Enable document search"" etc. It's annoying and has been happening so frequently the app is nigh unusable. However, the app serves its purpose and is the only free note app I can use on both my phone and my computer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unreliable. Bloated. Constant nags about updating to pro version. Slow. Used to love this app but uninstalling as it's just too buggy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"cool"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It's the best notepad app ever."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Highly recommended for everyone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Why after each update I have to re-download my already downloaded file to my phone, it takes much to long over 5 to 10 minutes to download a less then 500K file, (not 500MB) and yes, I do have a fast WiFi, back in the old Apps (2018) would only take less then 45 second!!!! So, why do you delete all my downloaded file after each update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"ഫയലുകൾ സൂക്ഷിക്കാനും പരിശോധിക്കാനും വളരെ നല്ലത്"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I only use it for basic lists. it's easy & handy."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dirty business practice. Investing in developing a premium grade app and releasing it for free, It blows up and countless people get used to having all these features. Especially for those who have mental illnesses like ADHD & even rely on it to access care. My pre DBT treatment wouldnt have been so excruciatingly difficult if I had the app I know. Then suddenly introduce ridiculous subscription fees, whilst also making it as difficult as possible to export organised notes to free apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"easy"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Nice to use for mobile"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The Gmail sync seems a little bumpy. still figuring this system out though!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Fix this -1) unnecessary Automatic duplication of notes , 2) application taking decades to open 3) even after saving notes ,last typed content gets automatically lost & have to retype again & again"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"You last update stinks. It is a money grab. I wish I could delete the upgrade, I was happy with the version the way it was."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unsyncing my device make my app worse. Now the problem is i cant open and im worried if my notes can be retrieve."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be great but completely unusable on Chromebooks now. Have to log into the web version if I even want to utilize Evernote. Need an app that works on Chromebooks. The web version isn't the answer. There is a reason people wants apps."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Overall, a decent notes application."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never seen an app consistently and continually get worse like Evernote. They should have left a legacy app when it actually worked so people could have a well functioning app while you enjoy playing around making useless app-breaking features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App is quite good, app glitches and overwrites some of the words while typing & screen moves upwards when a text is copied. Formatting text screen overlaps the part where text has to be edited."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"i love evernote. Very useful at my office."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very Best"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fav ever"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Sorry, Evernote. Our premium relationship has come to an end. You have become too clingy, too demanding, too heavy, even for simple tasks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"all around great app for everything, From jotting down quick Doodles, Typing full notes & task down. With an exceptional amount of Pre-Made templates to help."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I'd had ever note on my phone and my kindle fire for a couple of years. I recently had to get a new kindle and discovered that it's no longer available on kindle. It looks like I'm going to have to pick a new note app and transfer all my files. This is ridiculous !"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"They removed having offline notes years ago as a ""helpful update"" years later they release it again and it doesn't work. You select make all notebooks offline, and they don't. Sometimes buttons don't even work. I've had enable offline notebooks on for two weeks and only 3 notebooks are available offline. As a ux/ui designer, this application inspires me by how many mistakes they make. I genuinely hope a new company replaces Evernote and I think one will soon; they make too many mistakes to go on"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Best note app. Busted or lost phone? Just log back in and everything is there, for free!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My subscription has expired and I'd like to tale out some important information from the app. Is there anyway this can be done without having to buy another year's subscription?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hate the new version. Not a notepad anymore"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Seems to be working better with recent updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update 2023: I can't edit one of my notes. The app crashes every time. They've been trying to build a note taking app for TWENTY YEARS and it still doesn't work. ---------- Imagine you've been building a note product for over 20 years, burned $300M funding and basic editing is still buggy. I know, I know, it sounds impossible, but honestly – Evernote has managed it. At this point, I rule out incompetence and conclude that it's all a VERY elaborate joke. I applaud your commitment to the bit."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It now updated but STILL makes multiple notes (different versions) instead of just 1 note and would not save the last ones written. Delayed sync. Same problems since 2022. I'm moving to Nimbus now. Exporting all my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using this app for years but it has been so unreliable lately that I can't trust it anymore. Weird editing errors such as highlighting information to delete, once I do it also deletes lines that weren't highlighted so I'd have to undo then delete a whole paragraph one letter at a time using backspace. Another issue, the cursor and doing back gesture to see the whole doc doesn't work while scrolling through a file when using Gesture settings. Noticed this on my Pixel phones."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Best one..."

Why should I pay for a bugged incomplete app.Is it so hard to create a notepad version??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I enjoy Evernote. The only thing is that it keeps asking for updates."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not much left to say over other reviews. My best tip is to use it for everything and make it the one place you keep everything. If you use it halfheartedly it is not as useful. Update 2022: gave up on Evernote like so many others with the pricing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is one of the better tools to keep journals that you can take with you anywhere and add important articles and pictures. The only drawback for me is that I can't download to my Samsung tablet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Does not work across devices correctly. I have purchased a ""plus ""plan, yet my desktop version is still trying to upsell me to buy it (One hand does not talk to the other apparently). I have been searching notes on my desktop version, and it is sloooooooooooooow. This is a new development. I have been a satisfied customer since 2012. Sorry I only took the time to write when something goes wrong. UPDATE - It started working again and knows I am a plus - from 1 star to 4."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"would like to sync across more devices for free but otherwise very useful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very helpful for my ADHD."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"super handy for keeping notes on things. I use it like it's electronic version of post-it notes but with way more features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Update: the app keeps crashing and as a result will duplicate a note that I recently changed. This is incredibly annoying. The other day I noticed I had three copies of the same note with different additions to it. I use this to create to do lists and to get lists - if it keeps doing this I will miss things that I needed because it is on the duplicate I didn't notice. If this isn't fixed soon I will have to start looking for a new app and I've been using Evernote for years!! Please fix soon!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Forever Best Evernote 👍👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be good but they wrecked it. Glacially slow if it will even load notes. Most of the reviews that are not 1* reflect earlier versions, they now bombard you with paid upgrade requests but with it being so unusable now they are having a laugh! Look elsewhere. Latest is it doesn't appear to be able to open older notes, therefore reducing its use to zero. Going to try onenote- did it's way better. Evernote is it is now soooo bad I can't even get my old notes off by copy and paste (crashes)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Very bad it's not working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Have been using Evernote for around 10 years but not able to access my account using mobile app past 2months. Some glitch with login process in mobile. So each time I have to use laptop to access my files."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The Evernote app for Android now will not save my notes at all even though I keep hitting the green arrow at the top left corner of the screen. Sometimes when I edit a note and try to save it, the updated notes disappear before my eyes. At other times, the app makes a duplicate copy of the note for no apparent reason. The Android app for Evernote has become unusable. All of the bad reviews show that this is a big problem for many people."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent and very useful app to make notes of useful info. Also very convenient options to save or share with other users. One of the most useful apps for daily life"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"been using since 2015. Free version still does well for me"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Useful tool. Investing in it long-term is questionable as it's progressively getting worse. What's most annoying is the search function doesn't work. App will regularly not find notes but the notes are there when you scroll the list manually. They wanted to make search within attachments a paid feature and in doing so seems they broke the entire function. How can you trust a note taking app when you can't find notes you saved previously?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Highly Recommend! Evernote is my ""digital brain""."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It's a good notes app, supports many data types, syncs well. Sadly it's really annoying to open, popups and 'verify this' and 'upgrade now!' constantly. So I'll find something else."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"While using app it rotates the screen to landscape mode whenever phone is tilted even when phone orientation is locked in settings! This is very frustrating and there is no option to turn off this feature in app so this is a problem of app. Correct this problem as soon as possible!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This used to be such a great app and I've used it to manage my life for years but recently I've come to realise that my notes are disappearing.. Imagine opening up a note to find that half of it is missing. This has now become unreliable and sadly I will now have to find an alternative."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I like it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"great app"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"This version is not working , I'm not able to signin in this build"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"It was a good app for a while before they got rid of all the free users and then started just locking us out of the account unless we upgrade. The saddest part is I pay $30 a year for similar app called keeper and that protects me and all of my passwords up to 120 passwords and I pay $30 a YEAR and you want me to pay you $10 a month for stuff I write down off the top of my mind are you out of your mind?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app, but i don't how much secure is it!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"annual fee too high"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I can't wait until something comes around to replace Evernote. Watching it get steadily worse is disappointing. The version from five years ago is perfect. The Android app takes ten minutes for notes too load, usually they don't. Buttons stopped working in the newest update, literally cannot click or open anything. Notes no longer save. Setting for download all notebooks offline has been checked since launched, still hasn't downloaded more than 3, and thos STILL have to load to open. How..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Provide good service so that we can buy your product. What else are you begging at every turn, please buy the Pro version. Useless, very slow."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"No better app than this for note taking but recently I have been facing a problem where it is getting stuck at notes when I return from a different screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Excellent app for all capturing tasks, totally reliable, great work! Evernote is a must have for all platforms for me, and it is available for all platforms too! Update: After 14 years of Evernote Premium, it just doesn't feel like good value any more. The app seems to be filled with features I just don't need or want and I don't need the premium features. It's too expensive for what I actually use it for sadly. I've never lost a note in all those years of using the service,which I appreciate."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Multiple copies of the same file continue to deveple during use. Soon there are a handful of versions. Instead of just saving to an original, more and more copies keep being make, not a simple implementation. Then comes the part of trying to simply allow it to save. But then It builds new, unreliable and clutterfull version that make retrieval a total mess that causes reduced work productively with all this duplicatefile BS."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"love being able to Ave files on different devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent, love it, great way to save my notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app duplicates notes, creating multiple conflicting versions even though I'm only editing them on one device. (You can imagine how this blows up the monthly storage used.) I searched this issue on the web, and it has been going on for several years on multiple devices, not just Android. Seems like plenty of time for Evernote to get it right!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Notesnook!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have had it with EverNote. I'm officially moving to something else. This app went downhill quickly after starting to use it in October. Basic functions aren't even working properly (and yes I have contacted support. Didn't get far!). Several features are considered premium when shouldn't be (like being able to access support for example). I don't mind premium features but this is getting ridiculous. Dev aren't fixing issues users have had for years either. This app is a hot mess!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"horribly glitchy on Huawei P30 lite.. used this app for years, but past year it's become unbearably glitchy. when modifying a note, it hangs when saving, then very often doesn't save a chunk of last edits, and makes multiple copies of the note with ""conflicting changes"". currently have 5 versions of my edited notes, all in inexplicably different levels of progress, some versions with typos i fixed before I pressed the save button"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Never needed this but it on my phone and uses place for nothing"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Android's swipe left from edge to go back can't be used because it focuses back on the note at the end of my swipe. So I get stuck on the note. Maybe there's a way to lock all actions for 1 second after 'back' is triggered? UI is also arguably worse. Way too bulky ""above the fold"" and hard to get to where I want to go. I prefer a compact list of note titles, without any previews/snippets. Maybe add an option for view preferences like reddit."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using Evernote for almost 6 years. It helped to organize my ideas, and I like the option to save sound bytes & images. For the past few years I've been let down. Their loading time has gotten slower and is glitching so much that I'm afraid that it will not save my work. I can no longer sign in on 2 devices, work offline, or emulate an older version of the app layout that I prefer without paying monthly. I can't deal with it anymore, I will have to relocate my work to another site."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"A must have! UPDATED REVIEW - I have had this app since 2013, it's Dec 2022 and this is still by far one of my most used and enjoyed apps!! I use different notebooks in the app for unrealted projects, and the search feature is outstanding. It searches titles, content AND words in handwritten notes as well as text in pdf's. This is so helpful. I used the audio recording to record chapters of a book i wanted to write, then just forwarded the note to have the audio transcribed - awesome!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very useful way to keep notes, lists of things, reminders. Searchable and text can be formatted."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"My relationship with Evernote is the epitome of love-hate. While it has steadily added/improved functionalities over time, the pace of change has been frustrating, not to mention the bugs and clunky UI. The only reason I continued to use Evernote all these years was because of the lack of any serious competitors, until now. I recently moved over the UpNote and have no regrets. Yes, it lacks some advanced functionalities but it's so much cheaper and easier to use/ look at. Sorry Evernote! 🙃"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After the update , Evernote became very slow"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have used it already for 4 years now and i can advise this app to anyone that likes to making notes"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Support (RTL) languages like Arabic is awful! How can premium app (if it is true) miss that. I can't stand using this app as my notes app because I can't read what I write! WHAT IS THE BENEFIT. (Nothing so far)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I have to say, as a long time Evernote subscriber, that the app in its current form is bordering on unusable. Saving a note is a chore, and when it does finally save your changes, it often saves multiple conflicting notes. I opened the app today and tried to sync changes from another device. Another chore. Why doesn't it just sync on load? I'm sure it used to!?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've used Evernote for probably 10 years now and I love the desktop version but hate this app. It's not as functional and slow to register changes made in the app (for example, when I tagged a bunch of notes, I wasn't able to search for them on the app until I synced my desktop again). The app also makes it difficult to tell if you have a subscription and since I've canceled my subscription, I've been bombarded with pop-ups trying to convince me to resubscribe. Looking for an alternative now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Good app with few inconveniences but the ones present are significant. Evernote constantly makes duplicates and even duplicates of duplicates. Some have saved past things but not new, some have saved new things but not past, so trying to figure out which to keep and how to edit is a nightmare with no ability to compare or fuse. There also needs to be a widget to open a single note like the Samsung Notes app, as the widget for recent notes is inconveniently too large and can't be shrunk below 3x2"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Recently, aap stops working so many times... Taking too long to start typing or pasting stuff Processing is so slow... And many times stops responding"

In the previous 3 years evernote start to become slow and anoying with a lot of useless feature who complexify the app and make it loss is first quality. It looks like the web app become to be more close to the old version and I'll start to use it from now but I tried the mobil app and it don't follow the step back that the web app did so it's awful."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"2 wow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"A paid version? An only paid version for this so app? Get a life Evernote. Loved the app when I used it earlier when it did not appear to be a money making source but a convenience app. Thanks, uninstalling now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"It's great! my life's in here. though it's taken ages to introduce reminders and task features which is relatively basic"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Utterly shocked how this has such good reviews. Tried it using the app and the mobile Chrome browser to delete my account - neither works - the screen asking to enter the code I receive to email just disappears after I check email and everything has to be started from scratch.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I am a long time user. I use it multiple times a day and have thousands of notes. I wish I had the Evernote of 5 years ago. I hate the new Evernote, but have too many important items in EN to abandon it. I do not love it anymore. Too much bloat. ORIGNAL: I don't think that I could live without this app on my desktop and on my phone. I use it for recipes, web info and bookmarks, my most precious pictures, product information, inspirational quotes, scans of cards and letters I get, and tons more."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great idea, and a well built app! Very intuitive, very reliable. No ads. It is incredibly useful. Thwart your jobs closed intranet blocking you from your own online notes: they can be in the cloud, safe from your employer, accessible from your Own phone. Access the same notes from all ur laptops, tablets, phones. Also can transfer modest-size files with it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Uh.... So it's been years since I've used Evernote. Found things from 2012 that I forgot existed. You have changed the app so much. And not in good ways. It's clunky, there's so many features that I just don't need or want. It's too corporate and lost any bit of playfulness it had. Every 5 seconds it offers an upgrade. Uhm... No. My big issue tho is I kept getting emails saying someone's trying to reset my password. I reset it because it made me when I logged in, was that just Evernote?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"i haven't used the app but someone is trying to reset my password"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Need improvement for notes conflict and offline note merging. It's found on save device duplicate notes are being created. Also when using laptop in offline mode, merging in online updated note should be more smoother. It should add only extra data which is added. It should be intelligent to detect it"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"over time this app is becoming slower and slower and less intuitive to use. i use this on both mt phone and computer and have the same experience and find it dissapointing since this app was meant to streamline note taking on the go.

Cannot add any attachments. They broke it a couple of years ago with an update. I switched from a Pixel 3 that it didn't work on and now have a Pixel 6 pro. Nothing. The only assistance I ever got was a suggestion to use my desktop computer. Too bad I don't carry my desktop computer in my pocket. My mistake."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"If you haven't tried Evernote, I can quickly explain who Evernote is for. If you answer yes to these questions, well, welcome to the family. Is your mind already wandering? To the million things you could be doing other than app reviews? BUT you *have* to find the perfect app to organize your work?

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The speed increased and no crushes for now. Tasks looks bad due to the purple or pink bad visuals though no color is evil.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's very helpful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"So far it's wonderful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"easy to use n very helpful for those without the best memory ..writing everything down makes my life easier."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app force me to pay do get back my documents! I have been having the app for 5+ years! That's nasty. I payd you for a month, copy my notes and remove this trash app. This app became worse and especially design: I have to spend lots of time clicking and searching tupical features for notes. There lots of offline notes, in case you don't know. You have to learn have to treat your customer."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great app so far, cheap subscription too"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Use to be a good app! Since few months started to be less and less productive. I can't even copy a text and paste it somewhere else when I need it. Wake up guys! Do something or I will migrate asap to some other way better apps!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"this is good tool. you can note everything and any time"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Gave up on it. B"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote's buggier than ever! App keeps stopping for a few seconds and when it comes back to life it offers a 'wait: or 'close app' option, right when I'm trying to edit a note! More than once have I inadvertently hit the 'Close app' option while I'm writing, thereby losing all I've written. This used to be a stable, reliable, platform. Those days are long gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been experiencing similar issues with the app in recent months. I too have the duplicating notes etc. but most annoying issue Is the failure to cut/copy text from a note and paste it elsewhere. When selecting either cut or copy the text is removed from the note but doesn't copy to the clipboard. It doesn't happen all the time but certainly >70%. I am writing today because I lost important information that was copied but instead was cut and not copied to clipboard, note updated lost info."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I decided to pay for the upgrade. Absolutely worth being able to see my note from WAY back from any device."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great for taking notes. Unfortunately I cannot login into my account on a new phone. When I am trying to login, there's an endless loading that prevents me from logging in - I have stable internet, and have logged off the older phone from PC browser. Please fix this."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very fantastic app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Won't do background sync. Won't send push notifications of reminders either."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Automatically notes getting copied and deleted..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It is really v good , huge improvement."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using the app for years. But the last year and a half the app got worse and worse. With last update last night I have lost access to my notebook, lost pre define search. The search is not working. I can't use the app anymore and can't access to web version through my cellphone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible horrible waste of time. Does work on my new phone. Doesn't allow me to delete devices. A total scam with every page asking me to download app and pay for something I rarely ever use."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was good, now terrible. Absolutely no point in using this app. It's like they've nerfed me for not paying for premium. Notes don't update after being edited on the desktop and vice versa. Forget about using this whilst on mobile data as the note titles just sit there with their loading animation. Then we come on to actually going into the notes. Yup you've guessed it, the content fails to load. This is also whilst on WiFi, mind, and you'll be one of the lucky few if you manage to get it loading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Outstanding time and data management system."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"It used to be a great app until the latest update and now nothing works. My notes don't appear, just a spinning wheel on a blank screen. Please sort it out ASAP!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Got much worse over the years. Notes previews aren't automatically refreshed after edits are made. Now there's even daily useless notifications. The useful ones are so rare that I might just as well disable them completely."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Perfect for keeping files safe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Was an ok app but never synced correctly between my phone and computer. Tried the computer app and it led to me being basically locked me out of my account because I don't have premium (apparently it thought that was a 3rd device? I used the Evernote website in my browser and the phone app and wanted to switch to the computer application.). Now I'm switching to Notion, no complaints so far."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"This is my favourite note making app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I'm a list person. This app is my absolute favorite to keep me organized and to have a one-stop place to store ideas, quotes, project management tasks, grocery lists, to-do, important date reminders, and appointments. I don't know what I'd do without it and the multi-function options it gives me to track all the things I use it for!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"The app offers you guidance and asks you how you wanna use the app which is a great feature for someone who needs it. There is unfortunately no way to skip this step (or it is not very intuitive, and I didn't find it - which in that case is also not super user-friendly). It irritated me that is why I deleted the app 10 min after installation and will never try it again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The Best..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Useless for handwritten notes on tablet. No palm recognition, working with a stylus seems like an afterthought."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Terrible performance.. highly slow. Very irritating. I'm creating notes and it is creating literally 20-21 duplicate pages everytime saying conflict in notes. Also when I try to delete those extra created notes it is taking 30 to 40 mints overall because of slow content loading. Can your team suggest me on it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Dec 14 2022 - keeps on showing message ""evernote is not responding"" kindly fix please! Thanks! April 2, 2021 - I can't open my evernote after an update.. what gives? Please fix this ASAP! From Jan 2019 - just did an upgrade as recommended by the app and now i cant open evernote saying that there is an error in the database... how to fix this issue please? thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I like the app but just today it keeps crashing I can't get to my important notes. I was ready to purchase the app itself bow I'm having second thoughts. Need help"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's a very handy tool, and I have an option to cross things off my list's which I absolutely love!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"My netflix and other similar accounts got hacked as a result of ever note. The hackers broke into evernote and stole my passwords and user names which were saved as a note."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have been using Evernote for years and now after a recent app update have been experiencing the same issues as others mentioned. Notes don't load at all now, and prior to this, I was getting duplicates/notes not saving/partial saves. It's quite concerning as I have saved important information in the app, which I now can't access. It might be time to stop the paid membership and find something else more reliable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Wow"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I used to like Evernote. I used it for recording my workouts. It stopped loading my workout notes when I have little to no service rendering the app useless. Deleting the app. Need better offline mode."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"After several years using this application, since 2011, I'm going to abandon it, I'm extremely dissatisfied with the synchronization of notes, it doesn't work, many duplicate notes, and I use a PERSONAL account (paid for it), I don't have than worrying about whether or not I closed the note, this is annoying, it's been more than 10 years of use, it's better to use Google docs where the sync doesn't fail. I will use the remaining subscription time to migrate all notes to Google docs;"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Slow and bloated, which makes it nearly useless for its main function: quick, simple & practical notetaking. Unfortunately a lot of my notes accumulated over the years are here so I'm stuck with it. I advice brand new users to look elsewhere for their note-taking needs."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update is awful. Used to work great but now its deleted half of my notes I took randomly with no way to get it back (it didn't move the note to the trash, just wiped out half the text I typed from the note so only the first 3 out of 50 or so lines I wrote are even in the note). Also I can't access any of my notes because they won't load. So disappointing I trusted this app with important info and now it's irretrievably gone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I was in the middle of writing and the app closed on me. Now I can't get back into it no matter how many times i try. I just get a blank screen with the logo. So frustrated with how glitchy it's been lately. I need to access something in that note to reply to someone and now who knows how long until I can. If it has saved at all."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Ever since 1 years ago with the recent update its v buggy and lag there for quite sometime. Its no longer user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Ready to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I have been using Evernote since 2013, next year it will mark my 10 years and I absolutely love it! I do everything on Evernote and take it everywhere with me. No other notes app or task manager app can match this amazing platform."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Have been using this app since 2019 and it was my absolute favourite! No matter what people suggested using I always kept everything in here. But the last 3 months or so it's nothing but trouble. And now I can't access my notes, they just won't open and I don't know what to do. If I uninstall it, I might never access them again (according to the comments). What a pity... Edit: Uninstalled and installed the app, everything is great again!"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is awesome! I use it every single day! You will love it too.-Pamela Rae"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The app has just gotten worse and worse over the years. I once considered upgrading to a paid version but it's so buggy and difficult to use that I'm not gonna spend my harder earned money. The only reason I still use this app is because it's got hundreds and hundreds of notes and I'm slowly working on exporting them, but of course Evernote barely even allows me to login. So I can't login to see the notes and I can't login to export them. Just useless."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I have used the free version of Evernote for several years and have really enjoyed it and trusted it. I don't need anything fancy. Just jot a few notes as needed. I've never had a problem until today. My FREE app is now requiring me to either sign up again for a free app or pay. I'm sad to say I will have to look elsewhere for a replacement. Thank you Evernote for the time we had together."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Has it crashed?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Worst experience ever was working fine few days ago but now when opening a note it starts to buffer ,and black screen ......"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Update: I have loved this app for 10 yrs, now after a recent update, It won't load and all my notes, TONS are unreachable. This is SO UPSETTING because 11 yrs worth of notes, snapshots, recipes, receipts, directions, animal info, business info, etc appear gone!

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"(Edited 12/12/2022) I've been using Evernote for years. Love the PC version. The old Android app was fine but after last major update things started to get really awful. The most disappointing change was that it no longer allow me to sync notes manually. Sometimes the app could't save notes, and sometimes it created several conflicting notes while I was working on one. Today when I opened the app it couldn't show anything on the homepage, only a syncing circle spinning…"

Why do they always have to change things? Ugh!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Unsolicited notifications are extremely annoying and cannot be turned off within the app. App description fails to conspicuously inform people that we must pay a subscription fee to sync across more than 2 devices.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Most of the reviews here on the front-end(?) kinda already sums up everything. I can't fix something in Evernote, have my attention switch to another thing and return to see all what I typed in there. It doesn't save if I don't save unlike it used to and that's pretty terrible, cos it's no longer reliable that way. If there was a way I could export all my previous notes with ease, I'd jump, cos this unreliability is very risky and I've somehow lost confidence. Evernote used to be great..."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been using Evernote for 2 years now, and lately the app has slowed down alot. I was not able to attach an image to my notes recently. I'm someone who sticks with my apps out of productivity, but I'm starting to look for alternatives."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Noreply 🤫 Note to myself : Payment required"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Today I opened a note to check what it said, 3 seconds after opening it half the note deleted itself before my very eyes. This is the latest in a long list of issues I've had with Evernote, including notes duplicating themselves randomly, slow and buggy performance and problems syncing my notes between devices. Abysmal."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I use it for 10 years now. It's been more than a year that the user experience on their Android app is awful. UX is worse than 10 years ago, every click takes 3-20 seconds to see the new screen. To add a note on my phone, I now send an email to my Evernote account address with Gmail, it is MUCH faster than entering a new note in the Evernote android app. And their updates didn't improve any thing. And now even the search feature on the app is becoming useless.... only the PC app works. Shame."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"reading from image is excellent feature in this , even MS One Note doesn't have"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"sometimes buggy, going between the phone and desktop. I would pay for it if there were less bugs"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Loyal customer for 9 years. My account was recently hacked. It was being accessed from non-US locations via Skitch app? I never heard of this app and I never received any alerts of this odd activity in my account. I've lost thousands of dollars, maybe more, as a result of their lax security and lack of alerts. Very disappointing. I have screen shots of everything."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"nice app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Hey dev, this used to be the 'king among all notes' ya know, ive been using it like for almost a decade, just what the HECK happened to it now idk PLEASE BRING BACK THE PREVIOUS VERSION FOR ANDROID, JUST B4 THIS BS UPDATE, c'mon devs we used to loved u guys app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I've been using the app for years and years, it's usually very good. This year, however, my updates to notes usually create brand new duplicate notes. I have to double check both versions before deleting one each instance. I really like the overall organization and layout of things, so I haven't switched to another app. But the duplicate notes are annoying."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't even login on my smartphone. Works on tablet but not on my smartphone. Deleted the cache and re-installed it over and over again but no positive result at all. Been using it for last 6 years and hate to give it this kinda rating. Wish I could give this app a -1 star rating."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"very useful"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Have been using it for a really long time. I mostly like the app's features. But recently I've been writing a lot using headers and sub headings and I've not had a very good experience. Please make it more refined. Eg the writing cursor is very difficult to place where I want it to be."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Scratch out to any single feature they have to make you pay. Max characters, max notes, max devices. Add value to the app instead of removing functionality to foster a subscription, long gone are the days where this was a innovative and cool app. There are many others around that do the job."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't use app without unsyncing another device, 1 star because this restriction makes me not evernote on this app again."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used to be the best note taking app ever created. Now that title goes to One Note. There's always problems with this app, and I'm always having to unsync devices I don't even have, or lose access to my notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"CRASHES UPON OPENING. UNINSTALL & REINSTALL SO MANY TIMES BUT STILL THE SAME."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I had an issue then it has been solved thank you"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"great app! makes office and daily work a breeze."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"too many popups"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Full of bugs Since I upgraded to the paid Evernote, it is constantly crashing and freezing. When it does open, and stay open, it takes forever to enter notes. Also it doesn't always search notes properly. Very disappointing."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Keeps on crashing even after I uninstall and install"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Gets stuck at 30% on setup, then no progress and just elephant static screen if you close the app during them. If you accidentally enter a different email when trying to log in, it creates a new account for you, then never sends the verification code when you try to delete the extra account. Constant annoying popups to upgrade whenever you open the app. Limited to only 2 devices, including desktop web browser, AND they limit the number of unsyncs, so good luck if you have to reset devices! Dumb"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"*Update (12.2.22)* I uninstalled & reinstalled the app. Now the app opens..but all my attachments(voice memos, documents, basically anything I attached) won't open or play. Years worth of stuff gone. This has been my go-to app for years, but it seems like with every update, the app just starts to have issues. I haven't been able to get into the app all day today, it keeps closing out on me as soon as I try to start it. Very frustrating...especially when I have so many notes that I can't get to."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"literally love being able to make a note however I wish, also add snap shots to what I'm looking at and taking notes of!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"I just wish I could use the app on more than 2 devices"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Have been trying to login but it's not working"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Love Evernote. All the features are just amazing and it's perhaps one of the best note taking apps I've ever seen. Can organize my notes in seperate note books nicely. The features of editing notes are also handy, and the app theme is just pleasing to they eyes. I just wish that the notes can be available offline, that would be so much more convenient, especially when you often go out and travel. Thanks!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"As soon as they have your email address they start spamming you with emails."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Its usually good until today suddenly I got so many exxeption error. Is there problem with the version?"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent note app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This app has been my go-to note-taking app since before I even owned a smartphone. I love being able to quickly take typed, audio, or even hand-written notes, and then drop in a notebook or add a useful tag. It was indispensable for looking up notes during grad school, even when they were hand-written. I wish there were better features for larger projects to associate notes with each other or include whole Kanban boards like Notion. It would also be great to have a corresponding Wear OS app."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Fantastic app on Windows (version 10) but the Android and Chrome OS versions (version 8) lag a long way behind. 5 stars for the Windows version, which I've used daily for the last 8 years. 3 stars for the much poorer Chrome OS version, which I also use but struggle with (really slow and many caching issues). I use the paid version so no ads inside the app so please don't ask me to review the ads when I don't see any!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Taking too long to loading"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Lost a bunch of notes after updates"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very convenient note taking app, without hassle."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"organized and easy to use"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Used this app for years. Usually no problems but lately it keeps crashing when opening. Now the app loads up but nothing is clickable. Can't scroll along on the app. Can't open my notes (400+). Can't click on menu or anything. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I uninstalled it, but now I can't reinstall it. Ridiculous. I tested other apps, Playstore is allowing me to download other apps but I can't reinstall this one. I better not have lost my notes. I need them."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good for save my documents and notes."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Retry 2022: now it run's only after registration. Giving up Worthless free version since update constantly hanging, only thing that works is the request for report.. and including system logs.. find some payed testers who don't mind anger and stress management. throwing precious phone against walls because damned Evernote hangs and loose notes of hours work! Damn u Evernote! 4 hour's of work 4 nothing! Amateurs! Going back to @ least THAT works everywhere"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Keep crashing on Samsung S22 with One UI 5.0 :( How can I get my notes in urgent situation? UPDATE: I reinstalled Evernote as the advice and it's working fine. Tks."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"With the upselling already christ"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"App is very slow to open notes and save edits. Also rather annoying how it sometimes shows pop-ups to advertise it's premium service, which slows down the opening of your notes even more. Has tons of functionalities, but honestly I barely use any of them cuz, u know, I just want a notes app with a cloud. What's especially annoying is that when it has trouble saving your edits either a part of what you wrote simply won't get saved, or it will create 2 versions of the note"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Nice"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Consome muito a bateria do celular. Além de ter travamentos e falha no salvamento do documento."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernnote is the best and reliable Notebook I have ever used."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote WAS great but has seemingly lost its ethos. Rather than supporting existing power users, developers seem intent on phasing them out through constant updates that add nothing but bloat and annoying new features while abandoning the simple and flexible UI that brought users to the platform in the first place. Just have a look through the recent reviews and you'll see the same complaints repeated."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"keep track of your passwords"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"It is very useful to maintain your memories"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"The notes get deleted by themselves. So, this app is no longer reliable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"This used to be 5 stars, but now it's 4 because I'm tired of the incessant attempts to get me to buy pro version. I love the rest of the application and it's features."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Awesome"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Very Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Updated review : Used Evernote since 2010 and LOVED it. Happy to pay for Premium. During Nov 2022 it was unusable, especially on android. Duplication, losing notes, not saving, slow or won't open notes, circle of death, search not working. After googling I tried uninstalling it from my phone and reinstalled it so it would pick up fix version properly. It now works properly again. Such a relief! BUT huge confidence loss. Releases clearly not tested properly. If happens again, I'll move on."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Updated, last night making a note, it kept closing the keyboard at will. Noww... When I open note, it's blank 😳. The new interface makes it chunky and hard to work with. The recently opened note does not show in the 'recently opened notes' and what the hell is 'suggested notes'?? It shows irrelevant notes! =( I wish there was a simple version of it."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I've been using this a couple of years now but today it quit working. Crashes when I try to open. What happened??"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"What has happened to Evernote?! I've been using it for years and loved it, but now it just keeps crashing or not opening at all! I'm so frustrated that I've been looking at competing apps. So sad. (Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used to love this app but when I tried to use it today, it kept on crashing and wouldn't fully open"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love Evernote, been using for years and I do feel that even as a free user I get fantastic use out of it. Keep pushing me Evernote, I might go premium yet..."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"App keeps crashing today, 11/28/23 - using Galaxy Note 20 ultra. Works fine on Galaxy Note 8. Cleared cache on Note 20 and app opened up. I love this app and use it daily."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Using it for years. Very practical and easy to use. I like this application a lot."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"not safe for security, becareful for your notes especially confidential notes. I just hacked by hacker see my data in notes.."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Selecting text and deleting/replacing it removes not only the selected text, but some (or all) of the text around it. This one bug has made the mobile app a nightmare to use despite loving the web and desktop versions."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Evernote is the greatest app for keeping precious memories, documents, quick notes. Love the fact I can link Evernote to multiple devices."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"it's so nice application for students"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"user friendly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Pros: It works. Cons: Version conflict resolution does not exist. Text formatting function sucks. Newer versions often worse then older ones. For example, old version back to 2020 worked with text notes flawlessly. However, starting with 2021 update the app cannot handle plaint text note larger then 10 Kbytes and keeps freezing. The app keeps quitting from note Edit mode randomly which is expressly annoying. Premium price is ridiculously high.  To sum up, still looks and acts as beta product"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I just paid annual fee. Evernote no longer works...i mean AT ALL. Reinstalled several times, same results. DONT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THESE GUYS. ITS A RIP."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Great app, great customer service."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"I used this this app for 3 years now still not finding new updates why"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"La aplicación es buenísima y súper útil. Pero en el último tiempo tiene severos problemas de sincronización entre dispositivos. A su vez duplica notas todo el tiempo y mientras escribo vuelve a estados anteriores de la nota. Me hace perder mucho tiempo y por momentos llego a odiar la app, al punto de querer migrar todos mis datos a otra plataforma."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"The app works well for the most part. Unfortunately, it will now require a monthly subscription and I can not justify the paying the extra cost. If you can afford the extra cost, this service might be for you."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"excellent"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"very safe"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"nifty app for jotting down notes, been using it for years. although I can't use this app without the internet. Over-all still decent."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"- Amazing Interface/ UI; - User friendly - Can Syn upto 2 devices on ""free ver"" {wish would have been 3} - Support multiple platform So overall I liked it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Rated this 3 stars because of the good and decent usage on my Chromebook. But when I tried to use it on my phone, it simply can't be opened at all! I tried redownloading this app, had a stable connection, allowed all perms but it doesn't seem to work! Seriously, I hope this can be fixed because I loved using this app back then."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Evernote has become a complete mess. Corrupted records continually. Every time I try to make a checklist it duplicates things and syncs improperly. This App used to be nice, but now it's nothing but a pain. I can't trust it anymore."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Excellent. Free user can be installed on two devices. More than enough."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Very happy with the app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Been using Evernote for years. I'm a pretty simple person with simple notes, and I'm poor, so I have the free version and it was fine till around a year or so ago. Now, this app sucks, and if I didn't have years worth of notes I would switch without hesitation. I am constantly plagued with bugs and annoyances - duplicating notes, syncing issues, pop-ups asking me to upgrade (why would I upgrade when the experience is so terrible?), and more. It's always a chore to use this app now."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"i loved this 10 years ago, now its too complicated and glitchy to be considered useful sadly"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Cool good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Useful and intuitive. Only had an issue logging in on mobile after an update, and had to reinstall which was a pain. Temp solution was to use desktop."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Update: there is an Edit protection feature. Not sure when this was implemented but it's much appreciated! I love this mostly for keeping recipes I find online. The only thing I wish this app had is the ability to read only or lock editing. It's been requested for years but this feature is not available yet."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I wish I could give it zero stars. A once decent app that is so painfully bad now. I just spent over ten minutes trying to look up a note and still haven't been allowed to see it. ""Just sit thru this sales pitch in premium first, then sit through a slide show, oh, you can't log off and back on as someone else..."""
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"Not any novel or even useful note taking features, same as 10 years ago."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I used it many years ago, Why I can't login in the updated app when i re-install? It's not working. It's waste of time to wait on login section and it says, “Please, wait...”"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"awesome app"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I love it"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"If you're writing with free version, Evernote might just completely remove everything you have written instead of saving locally. I was writing out something important on my phone in bed when I woke up next morning to find none of it had even saved except for the first sentence. It should be made painfully clear that free ver does not save locally. Might be shaky connection. But you have to pay for premium just to recover with history. No thanks. Don't use this app! Actual security is paywalled."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Great for the organised mind. even greater for those who want to become organised. A POWerful tool to be used across the board. 👌🏾@NikaTheSunQueen"

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Can't login, still on please wait screen"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Anyone else have the problem for the last couple of days with the app not wanting to open? Tried everything I can do to fix my end. Uninstalling the app and reinstalling fixed the problem. Thanks."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"I typically do not write poor reviews as I believe each person has their own experience. However, I am going to tell the story here. I wanted to love Evernote. I love their blogs. I love all the ways they make it seem so easy to use their product. However, as a software designer, process improver, and intentional user experience evaluator, I could not be more disappointed. I was simply trying to take photos of some notes, upload them on an android device and it was awful. Use b4 selling!!!"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Absolutely Amazing, pairs great with the building a second brain book"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"Started using the app in 13. Dont like being forced to access my retrieval Email on the same device I am accessing. I keep them compartmentalized. Keylogers must love this feature from yall... Go pigeon hole someone else. Uninstalled on ALL of my devices...Had not used it in a while and these *security* changes are not for me."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have used Evernote for over 10 years now and have loved it up until recently. Now it just edits notes without pushing edit. I save recipes from years ago on Evernote and they have recently gotten ruined. Plus, my grocery list erased things and added words by voice. I had to screenshot my list and use that instead of the actual app. Please go back to the way it used to be where you had to press edit to change the note. And take the edit button away from where you hold your phone."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"greatest note app ever"

Auf meinem smartphone kann ich sie kaum noch nutzen. Update: Neues Phone (Google Pixel 6), damit läuft die App recht gut. Könnte schneller sein. Vorallem die Syncs, wenn man z.b.

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",3,"Been using the app for years. Love it, but gave a lower rating because I am sick of the frequent text messages telling me what my verification code is when I have not requested nor needed a verification code. From what I understand, it is a disfunction of their system that they either can't or won't correct which is unacceptable."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",4,"Cut and paste doesn't work anymore on galaxy s21+"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"The below problem was resolved when I uninstalled and downloaded the app again. Back to working properly thank goodness but also a reminder that I need another backup in case this ever happens again! (Today I wake up to an updated version that doesn't open!! The app just crashes when I click on it. I'm unable to access my very important notes saved only in Evernote!! Shocked at how unreliable it is. Never happened before.)"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Working perfectly after update. Thanks"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",1,"This app is buggy, slow and unreliable on Android, sometimes it won't let me save, I lose notes, and it seems to overly rely on constant internet access which is unacceptable"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I have a Droid, Galaxy S21, running at home on a 5G Wi-Fi. This app has turned into a cluster bug on my cell which is sad because it was once user friendly. This Clipping function is useless. While I can Clip something into Evernote I can't put it in a Notebook I want and can not create a new tag. I have to go into Evernote and try to move it to where I want. And then I can never locate anything. In Excel I can click a cell and will tell me it's source or orphans."
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"Good"
"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",5,"I really appreciate the developers of Evernote. It's indeed one of the best app for note taking and productivity. It's really helpful for taking down notes, recording data, clipping web pages, and much more. Hats off to the developers. Keep developing it."

"Evernote - Note Organizer","Unknown",2,"I just downloaded the app on to my android tablet, from what I know it is compatible with android, but it stops responding each time I begin to use the helpful tour it does at the beginning, and I've already attempted troubleshooting by doing the basics as much as I can on a tablet."

They said they can't help because that's what they known for. Are you guys serious? If something like this happens customer care is always there for the help. I hate that I used your app for years. Finally I need your help to restore my account but yous didn't help."
